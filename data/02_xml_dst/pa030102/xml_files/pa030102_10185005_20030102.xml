<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to color filter substrates suitable for use in liquid crystal display devices for electronic apparatuses, such as mobile phones and mobile personal computers. The present invention also relates to methods for manufacturing such color filter substrates. The present invention also relates to liquid crystal display devices and electro-optical devices including the color filter substrates and to methods for manufacturing the electro-optical devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention relates to a color filter substrate, in which a plurality of color pixels, such as R (red), G (green), and B (blue) pixels, or C (cyan), M (magenta), and Y (yellow) pixels, are formed in a predetermined region on a base member delimited by a bank-like delimiting member, and a protective layer is formed on the surfaces of the color pixels, to a method for manufacturing the color filter substrate, to a liquid crystal display device, to an electro-optical device, and to a method for manufacturing the electro-optical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, liquid crystal display devices have been widely used for electronic apparatuses, such as mobile phones and mobile personal computers. Liquid crystal display devices in which color displays are performed using color filter substrates have also been widely used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a conventional color filter substrate, such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, on the surface of a base member <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> composed of glass, plastic, or the like, for example, color pixels <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), respectively, are arranged in a predetermined pattern, such as a stripe pattern, a mosaic pattern, or a delta pattern, and a protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is further formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is formed in order to perform the following four functions. Firstly, by forming the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the surface of the color filter substrate is planarized, and thereby, when electrodes are formed on the surface of the color filter substrate, the function of preventing the disconnection of the electrodes is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Secondly, the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is formed so that the function of improving the contrast ratio between pixels is performed by reducing resistance of the electrodes on the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Thirdly, the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is formed in order to prevent the pixels included in the color filter from being flawed in the steps subsequent to the formation of the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, that is, in order to perform the protective function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Fourthly, when the color filter substrate is used for a liquid crystal display device, by forming the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent impurities from being diffused from the color filter substrate into the liquid crystal after the liquid crystal is filled in the cell gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When such a protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is formed, conventionally, in general, a black mask is formed on the base member <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of color pixels, such as R (red), G (green), and B (blue) pixels, or C (cyan), M (magenta), and Y (yellow) pixels, are formed in a predetermined region delimited by the black mask. A liquid transparent resist or the like is then applied over the entire surface of the base member <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> provided with the color pixels at a uniform thickness by spin-coating or the like, and the transparent resist or the like is subjected to patterning by a photolithographic method to form the protective layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, when the photolithographic method is used, problems, such as an increase in costs, arise because the process is complex and large amounts of the individual color materials, the photoresist, etc. are consumed. In order to overcome such problems, a method has been proposed in which a filament or the like is arranged in a dot pattern by ejecting materials for the filter or the like in a dot pattern by an ink-jet method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), first, a bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on a glass base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a predetermined height. The delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of a resinous material which has repellency to materials <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the filter (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) ejected by the ink-jet method. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), when the filament or the like is formed by supplying the materials <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the filter to the individual regions, it is possible to prevent the adjacent materials <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the filter to be mixed with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In this way, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the filament or the like composed of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B having different colors is formed. Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), a protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is applied on the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, and the color filter substrate is thereby manufactured. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional method, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is usually composed of a resin having repellency to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the liquid material of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> applied thereon repel each other, which may result in uneven application of coating on the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the surface of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When the color filter substrate in which the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coated unevenly is used as a component of a display device, variations in color tone occur in an image displayed by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been achieved in view of the problems described above. It is an object of the present invention to form a protective layer so that the surface thereof has excellent flatness in a color filter substrate, in which color pixels of a plurality of colors are formed in predetermined regions on the surface of a base member delimited by a bank-like delimiting member, and the protective layer is formed on the color pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> By achieving the object described above, it is an object of the present invention to prevent the disconnection of electrodes effectively when the electrodes are formed on the surface of the color filter substrate. When the color filter substrate is used as a component of a display device, it is an object of the present invention to reduce variations in color tone in the image displayed by the display device. Moreover, it is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic apparatus provided with the liquid crystal display device or the electro-optical device described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present inventions takes advantage of findings that by surface-treating the surface of a bank-like delimiting member to decrease the repellency to a liquid material constituting a protective layer before forming the protective layer, planarization of the surface of the protective layer is ensured, and thus the present invention has been completed. That is, the present invention provides the color filter substrate, the method for manufacturing the same, and the liquid crystal display device described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A color filter substrate in accordance with the present invention can include a base member, a bank-like delimiting member formed at a predetermined height on the base member so as to delimit color-pixel-forming regions having a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member, color pixels formed in the color-pixel-forming regions by applying liquid color pixel materials, and a protective layer formed on the surfaces of the color pixels by applying a liquid protective layer material. The delimiting member can be composed of a resin having repellency to the color pixel materials and to the protective layer material, and the surface of the delimiting member is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the protective layer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, a protective layer having excellent flatness can be formed. Therefore, when electrodes are formed on the surface of the color filter substrate, it is possible to prevent the disconnection of the electrodes effectively. When the color filter substrate is used as a component of a display device, it is possible to reduce variations in color tone in the image displayed by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, the protective layer may be formed so that the thickness thereof partially varies. In such a construction, even when the plurality of color pixels formed on the base member have thicknesses that vary among the regions delimited by the delimiting member, it is possible to planarize the surface of the color filter substrate. It is also possible to prevent the unevenness of the color pixels from appearing on the surface of the color filter substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, the bank-like delimiting member may be composed of a material including a fluorocarbon resin or a silicone resin. The protective layer may be composed of a material including at least one resin selected from the group consisting of acrylic resins, epoxy resins, imide resins, and fluorocarbon resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In such a construction, the protective layer can fully exhibit the four functions described above. In such a case, the delimiting member is preferably composed of a material having a contact angle of 25&deg; or more with respect to the color pixel materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, preferably, the protective layer material has a viscosity of 3 to 50 mPa&middot;s. Consequently, it is possible to form the protective layer smoothly and efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, preferably, the surface treatment includes treatment based on oxygen (O2) plasma ashing, atmospheric plasma ashing, or UV ashing. Consequently, the wettability of the delimiting member to the liquid material constituting the protective layer can be increased, and uneven application of the protective layer material can be prevented. Thereby, flatness of the surface of the protective layer is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, preferably, the surface treatment is performed so that the contact angle of the protective layer with respect to the base member is 20&deg; or less. Consequently, it is possible to form the protective layer without uneven application of coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, a light-shielding layer may be formed in a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member. In such a case, the bank-like delimiting member may be formed on the surface of the light-shielding layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, the bank-like delimiting member may have a light-shielding effect, and in such a case, the delimiting member also functions as a light-shielding layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate of the present invention, the light-shielding layer may function as a black mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, a method for manufacturing a color filter substrate in accordance with the present invention can include the steps of forming a bank-like delimiting member at a predetermined height on a base member so as to delimit color-pixel-forming regions having a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member, forming color pixels by applying liquid color pixel materials to the color-pixel-forming regions on the surface of the base member; and forming a protective layer by applying a liquid protective layer material to the surfaces of the color pixels. The delimiting member can be composed of a resin having repellency to the color pixel materials and to the protective layer material, and the surface of the delimiting member is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the protective layer material. In this manufacturing method, after the surface of the delimiting member is subjected to the surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the protective layer material, the protective layer is formed by applying the protective layer material onto the surfaces of the color pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the method for manufacturing the color filter substrate described above, it is possible to obtain a color filter substrate in which disconnection of electrodes and variations in color tone are prevented effectively when used in a display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing the color filter substrate described above, a material including a fluorocarbon resin or a silicone resin may be used as the bank-like delimiting member. A material including at least one resin selected from the group consisting of acrylic resins, epoxy resins, imide resins, and fluorocarbon resins may also be used as the protective layer. Additionally, preferably, a material having a contact angle of 25&deg; or more with respect to the color pixel materials is used for the delimiting member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing the color filter substrate described above, preferably, the protective layer material has a viscosity of 3 to 50 mPa&middot;s. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Such a construction may be achieved by selecting the color pixel materials as inks to be ejected by a so-called ink-jet ink-ejection method. In such a case, as the ink-jet method, a method of ejecting ink using elastic deformation of a piezoelectric element, a method of ejecting ink using thermal expansion of ink, or any other given method may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing the color filter substrate described above, since inks, i.e., the color pixel materials, can be supplied to the individual positions in the plurality of regions on the base member in desired amounts, it is possible to manufacture a color filter substrate of high resolution. Since the color pixel materials can be ejected by highly controlling the ejection amount, etc. for each of the plurality of regions, the color pixel materials are prevented from being wasted, and the color filter substrate can be manufactured inexpensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing the color filter substrate described above, the protective layer may be formed by ejecting droplets of the protective layer material onto the surfaces of the color pixels.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device having the construction described above, in the color filter substrate, the protective layer material preferably has a viscosity of 3 to 50 mPa&middot;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device having the construction described above, in the color filter substrate, the surface treatment preferably includes treatment based on oxygen (O2) plasma ashing, atmospheric plasma ashing, or UV ashing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display device having the construction described above, in the color filter substrate, the surface treatment is preferably performed so that the contact angle of the protective layer with respect to the base member is 20&deg; or less. In such a construction, it is possible to form the protective layer without uneven application of coating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Since the liquid crystal display device using the STN liquid crystal or the TN liquid crystal performs a display making use of birefringence of the liquid crystal, the thickness of the liquid crystal layer formed by a pair of substrates must be uniform over the entire surface of the display region. Therefore, such a construction which ensures the flatness of the portion of the color filter substrate is used particularly effectively when the STN liquid crystal or the TN liquid crystal is used. </paragraph>

The delimiting member can be composed of a resin having repellency to the color pixel materials and to the protective layer material, and the surface of the delimiting member is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the protective layer material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of color filter substrates, methods for manufacturing the same, and liquid crystal display devices in accordance with the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the structure of a color filter substrate in an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed on the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed at a predetermined height on the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to delimit color-pixel-forming regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed in the color-pixel-forming regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by arranging liquid color pixel materials. The protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the surfaces of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by arranging a liquid protective layer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of a resin having repellency to the color pixel materials and to the protective layer material, and the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thereof is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the liquid protective layer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the material for the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited as long as it can prevent the adjacent color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from being mixed with each other. For example, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be composed of a material including a fluorocarbon resin or a silicone resin. These resins may be used alone or in combination of not less than two of them. Preferably, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of a material including a fluorocarbon resin, and in particular, a material having a contact angle of 25&deg; or more to the color pixel materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it should be understood that the material for the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited as long as it can exhibit the four functions described above. For example, the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be composed of a material including at least one resin selected from the group of acrylic resins, epoxy resins, imide resins, and fluorocarbon resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed by ejecting droplets of the protective layer material on the surfaces of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using an ink-jet method. In such a case, the liquid material for the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> preferably has a viscosity of 3 to 50 mPa&middot;s. If the viscosity is less than 3 mPa&middot;s, the fluidity may become too high to form a layer (i.e., film). On the other hand, if the viscosity exceeds 50 mPa&middot;s, the fluidity may become too low to form a uniform layer (i.e., film) over the entire region of the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Herein, the repellency to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> means that the contact angle of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is large, that is, the wettability of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with respect to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is small. If the wettability is small, uneven application of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> occurs on the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the flatness of the surface of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is impaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> By performing the surface treatment as described above on the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, even when the surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has repellency to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is possible to increase the wettability to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and uneven application of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be prevented. Therefore, the flatness of the surface of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The surface treatment is not particularly limited as long as uneven application of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be prevented by increasing the wettability to the liquid material constituting the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (i.e., by modifying the surface); for example, treatment by oxygen (O2) plasma ashing, atmospheric plasma ashing, or UV ashing may be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Herein, oxygen (O2) plasma ashing means treatment in which the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is irradiated with oxygen (O2) and a plasma in a vacuum, and preferably the treatment is performed so that the contact angle of the protective layer to the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 20&deg; or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Atmospheric plasma ashing means treatment in which the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is irradiated with a plasma in air, and preferably the treatment is performed so that the contact angle of the protective layer to the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 20&deg; or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> UV ashing means treatment in which the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is irradiated with UV light in a vacuum or in air, and preferably the treatment is performed so that the contact angle of the protective layer to the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 20&deg; or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed in a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> functions as a so-called black mask or black mask to enhance the contrast of display images by shielding the peripheries of the individual color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> itself may have a light-shielding effect. In such a case, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also functions as the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a plan view showing a color filter substrate in an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken along the line I-I of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located thereunder are formed on the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to delimit the color-pixel-forming regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having a predetermined pattern on the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located thereunder are formed in a grid pattern in which regions for forming the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> correspond to grid openings, and the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed so as to fill the grid openings. Thus, a plurality of color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the base member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a dot pattern, and in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), in a dot matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is composed of a metal or resinous material which does not transmit light (i.e., which shields light). Each color pixel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is composed of a coloring material of any one of the colors selected from the group consisting of, for example, R (red), G (green), and B (blue). The color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the individual colors are arranged in a predetermined pattern. Examples of arrangements include, a stripe pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a mosaic pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and a delta pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the stripe pattern, colors are arranged so that all of the color pixels in a single column of a matrix are of a single color. In the mosaic pattern, colors are arranged so that any three color pixels aligned vertically or horizontally correspond to three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue). In the delta pattern, alternate rows are staggered and any three adjacent color pixels correspond to three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), with respect to the size of the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for example, the diagonal size T0 is 1.8 inches. With respect to the size of one color pixel, for example, horizontal length L0 vertical length L1 is 30 mm 100 mm. The distance between the adjacent two color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, i.e., a so-called pitch P0 between elements, is, for example, 75 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the color filter substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the heights (i.e., thicknesses) of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B may be smaller than the height of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or may be larger than the height of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The individual color pixels may have the same thickness or different thicknesses. When the color pixels are formed so as to have different thicknesses, for example, the thickness of the G color pixel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G may be the largest, the thickness of the R color pixel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R may be the next largest, and the thickness of the B color pixel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B may be the smallest. The primary reason for forming the color pixels so as to have different thicknesses as described above is that a specific color is enhanced or attenuated according to the observer&apos;s desire. Alternatively, the thickness of the G color pixel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G which has a large visual effect on the resolution may be formed smaller than the other color pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When the individual color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B have different thicknesses, the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed so as to thickness that varies according to the different thicknesses of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as a color filter substrate in a liquid crystal display device, electrodes are provided on the surfaces of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In such a case, if the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed have an uneven surface, steps may occur in the electrodes, resulting in disconnection of the electrodes. In contrast, as is the case of the present invention, by forming a protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the surface thereof has excellent flatness, disconnection of the electrodes can be prevented reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> When the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as an optical element for full color display, pixels, each including three color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) as a unit, are formed, and a full color display can be performed by passing light selectively through any one of the R (red), G (green), and B (blue) regions in the pixel or a combination thereof. In such a case, the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can prevent light from leaking out from sections other than the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> With respect to the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a plurality of color filter substrates may be formed on a mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a large area as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Specifically, first, a pattern for one color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed on each of a plurality of color-filter-forming regions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, cutting grooves are formed around the color-filter-forming regions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cut along the scribing lines, and thereby the individual color filter substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> When a liquid crystal display device is taken into consideration, a common electrode substrate, which is another substrate, is bonded to the color filter substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A plurality of common electrode substrates may also be formed on a mother substrate having a large area. The cutting step described above may be performed after a mother substrate for the color filter substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a mother substrate for the common electrode substrates are bonded together to form a pair of glass substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A method for manufacturing a color filter substrate in accordance with the present invention will be described below in which the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (a) is taken as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a method for manufacturing the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> step by step schematically. First, the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed in a grid pattern when viewed from the direction indicated by the arrow B, using a metal or resinous material which does not transmit light, for example, Cr (chromium), on the surface of a mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> composed of glass, plastic, or the like. Grid openings in the grid pattern correspond to regions in which color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are formed, i.e., the color-pixel-forming regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The planar size of each color-pixel-forming region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed by the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, viewed from the direction indicated by the arrow B, is, for example, approximately 30 mm 100 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In order to form the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a material (for example, Cr) is deposited at a uniform thickness of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mm by a given deposition method (such as sputtering), and then the grid pattern is formed by an appropriate patterning method (such as photolithography) (step P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> After the shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed, in step P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the bank-like delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed. Specifically, a resinous material for forming the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed at a predetermined thickness by a spin-coating method, and then a predetermined grid pattern is formed by an appropriate patterning method (such as photolithography). The resinous material has repellency to the liquid material for the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and preferably, has ink-repellent properties. Additionally, the width of the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the width of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> do not necessarily agree with each other. Under normal circumstances, the width of the light-shielding layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is larger than or substantially the same as the width of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Next, in step P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) are formed in the regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> delimited by the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for example, using an ink-jet method. Specifically, while the surface of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is scanned by moving an ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, materials <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for color pixels are ejected as ink droplets from nozzles <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> provided on the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at a predetermined timing corresponding to any one of the array patterns shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and are deposited on the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The color pixel materials <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are then dried and solidified by firing treatment, ultraviolet irradiation treatment, or vacuum drying treatment. By repeating the above-mentioned process for each of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B, the color pixel pattern can be formed with the desired arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, in step P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a wettability improvement processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which is not in contact with the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is put into operation, and wettability improvement treatment is performed by the application of a treating material <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, such as oxygen gas or UV light. By this treatment, the contact angle of the liquid material, for example, the protective layer material, with respect to the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is decreased, and the ink-repellent properties are decreased. The wettability improvement treatment described above is not particularly limited as long as the wettability to the liquid material is increased, that is, the surface is modified, and uneven application of coating is prevented, for example, oxygen (O2) plasma ashing, atmospheric plasma ashing, or UV ashing may be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, in step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the regions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> delimited by the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, for example, using an ink-jet method. Specifically, in the same manner as that in the case of the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, while the surface of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is scanned by moving the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the protective layer is ejected as ink droplets from nozzles <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> provided on the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at a predetermined timing corresponding to any one of the array patterns shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and is deposited on the individual color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The protective layer material is then dried and set, for example, by firing treatment at 200&deg; C. for 30 to 60 minutes, and thus the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed in the shape of a film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the ink-jet treatment in color pixel formation step P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, color pixels may be formed by repeated scanning of the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for each color of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), or three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) may be formed simultaneously by single scanning of an ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in which nozzles for three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the ink-jet treatment in the protective layer formation step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, preferably, a predetermined amount of ink (i.e., the protective layer material) droplets are supplied to the entire surface of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during single scanning of the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, when the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed in the grid openings have different thicknesses for each of the colors of R(red), G (green), and B (blue), preferably, the amount of ink (i.e., the protective layer material) ejected from the nozzles <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is adjusted appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The ink jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> used in the color pixel formation step P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> used in the protective layer formation step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the same ink-jet apparatus in turn or may be mounted on different inkjet apparatuses so that the ink-jet apparatuses are used separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the same ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the same ink-jet apparatus on which the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted may be used, and inks to be supplied to the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be changed depending on whether the color pixel materials are used or the protective layer material is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Although the method for scanning the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the color pixel formation step P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the protective layer formation step P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is not particularly limited, for example, a method may be employed in which a plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are aligned to form a nozzle row with a length substantially the same as one side of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the materials <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for the color pixels and the material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the protective layer are supplied to the entire surface of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by single scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, with respect to an ink-jet head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a nozzle row with a length shorter than a side of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a method may be employed in which the inks are supplied to the entire surface of the mother substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by repeating main scanning for ejecting the inks and subscanning for shifting the main scanning position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Next, scribing lines, i.e., cutting grooves, are formed at predetermined positions in the completed empty panel structure, and the panel structure is broken, i.e., cut, based on the scribing lines (step P<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>).

In the liquid crystal filling process, usually, for example, a liquid crystal is stored in a storage container, and the storage container containing the liquid crystal and the rectangular empty panel are placed in a chamber. After the chamber is evacuated, the rectangular empty panel is immersed in the liquid crystal in the chamber, and the chamber is then exposed to atmospheric pressure. At this stage, since the inside of the empty panel is under vacuum, the liquid crystal pressurized by atmospheric pressure is introduced into the panel through the liquid-crystal-filling port. Since the liquid crystal adheres to the exterior of the liquid crystal panel structure after the filling of the liquid crystal, the rectangular panel filled with the liquid crystal is cleaned in step P<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Scribing lines are then formed at predetermined positions on the rectangular mother panel which has been filled with the liquid crystal and cleaned, and the rectangular panel is cut based on the scribing lines.

<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, each display dot <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> which functions as a switching element and a current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which functions as a current-controlling element that controls volume of current to be applied to the EL device. The source of the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is connected to a source line <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, the gate thereof is connected to a gate line <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, and the drain thereof is connected to the gate of the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The source of the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is connected to a current-supplying line <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, and the drain thereof is connected to an EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is a luminescent device having the structure in which an EL layer including a luminescent layer is sandwiched between an anode and a cathode. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> is shown as a substantially square anode, an EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> including the luminescent layer is deposited on the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, and a cathode (not shown in the drawing) as a common electrode shared by the individual display dots <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is deposited thereon. Such a layered structure constitutes the EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> color filter substrate <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, for example, the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be used. Since the structure of the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the manufacturing method thereof have been described, detailed description thereof will be omitted. In this embodiment, the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of a resin having repellency to the material for the color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to the material for the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the liquid material for the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Due to the features with respect to the delimiting member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> described above, the surface of the protective layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is planarized with high precision. Therefore, it is possible to form other film elements on the surface of the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> at desired positions, at desired sizes, and with high precision. Additionally, the individual color pixels <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constituting the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provided in a region at least larger than the effective display region V shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, in one display dot <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, two TFTs, specifically, the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> which functions as a switching element and the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which functions as a current-controlling element for controlling the amount of current flowing to the EL device, are provided. Although these TFTs are formed as n-channel TFTs in this embodiment, both or either one of them may be formed as a p-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> includes an active layer including five types of elements; i.e., a source region <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, LDD (Lightly doped Drain) regions <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, a high-concentration impurity region <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, and channel-forming regions <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> also includes a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, gate electrodes <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, a source line <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> and a drain line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are electrically connected to each other by the gate line <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> composed of a material that is different from and has a lower resistance than those of the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and thus a double gate structure is formed. Of course, instead of the double gate structure, a so-called &ldquo;multi-gate&rdquo; structure, such as a triple gate structure, i.e. the structure that includes an active layer comprising at least two channel-forming regions connected in series, may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The active layer is composed of a semiconductor film containing a crystal structure, i.e., a monocrystalline semiconductor film, a polycrystalline semiconductor film, or a microcrystalline semiconductor film. The gate electrodes <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the source line <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, and the drain line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> may be composed of any type of conductive film. In the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the LDD regions <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are provided so as not to overlap the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> being placed therebetween. Such a structure is significantly effective in reducing the off-state current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> includes an active layer including four types of elements, i.e., a source region <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, a LDD region <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>, and a channel-forming region <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, and a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, a gate electrode <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, a first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, a source line <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>, and a drain line <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>. Although the gate electrode <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> has a single gate structure, a multi-gate structure may be used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the drain of the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of the current-controlling TFT. Specifically, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> of the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the drain region <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> of the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> via the drain line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The source line <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> is connected to the current-supplying line <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> supplies a current to make the EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> emit light while controlling the amount of current supply to enable gray-scale display. Therefore, degradation-preventing measures must be taken by hot carrier implantation so that degradation is prevented even a current is applied. When black is displayed, the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is turned off, and in such a case, if the off-state current is high, it is not possible to obtain satisfactory black display, resulting in a decrease in contrast. Therefore, preferably, the off-state current is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> is formed on the first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> is, for example, composed of an insulating film containing silicon. The first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> protects the resultant TFT from alkali metals and water. An EL layer provided above the TFT in the final stage contains an alkali metal, such as sodium. That is, the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> functions as a protective layer which prevents such an alkali metal from entering the TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> If the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> is formed so as to have a heat-dissipating function, it is also possible to prevent thermal degradation of the EL layer. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, since the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is irradiated with light, the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> must transmit light. When an organic material is used as the EL layer, since the EL layer is degraded due to bonding with oxygen, preferably, an insulating film which easily emits oxygen is not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> A second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> is formed on the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> so as to cover the individual TFTs. The second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> planarizes the steps formed by the TFTs. As the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, for example, an organic resin film composed of a polyimide, a polyamide, or an acrylic resin may be used. Of course, if satisfactory planarization is enabled, an inorganic film may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Since the EL layer is very thin, if the surface where to form the EL layer has steps, insufficient light emission may occur. Therefore, it is important to planarize the steps formed by the TFTs using the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> so that the EL layer formed thereon functions normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> A second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> is formed on the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. The second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> prevents penetration of the alkali metal from the EL device. The second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> may be composed of the same material as that of the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>. The second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> preferably also functions as a heat-dissipating layer which dissipates heat generated at the EL device. Such heat-dissipating function prevents the accumulation of heat in the EL device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> A pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> is formed on the second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. The pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> is, for example, composed of a transparent conductive film, and functions as the anode of the EL device. With respect to the formation of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, a contact hole, i.e., opening, is formed in the second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>, the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, and the first passivation film <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight>, and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> is formed so as to connect to the drain line <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> of the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in the contact hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> is formed on the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. The EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> has a single layer structure or a multilayer structure, and in many cases, multilayer structures are used. In the EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight>, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, or a luminescent layer is directly in contact with the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the luminescent layer emits white light, and a color display is performed when the white light passes through the R, G, and B color pixel regions in the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> A cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> is formed on the EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight>, and a protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> is further formed thereon. The cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> and the protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> are formed, for example, by vacuum deposition. Additionally, if the cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> and the protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> are continuously formed without exposure to air, it is possible to suppress the degradation of the EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight>. A light-emitting device including the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, the EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight>, and the cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> corresponds to the EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> As the cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>, a material including magnesium (Mg), lithium (Li), or calcium (Ca) having a small work function may be used. The protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> is provided to protect the cathode <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> from outside moisture, etc., and may be composed of a material including aluminum (Al) or silver (Ag). The protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> also has a heat-dissipating effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> A third passivation film <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is formed on the protective electrode <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight>. The third passivation film <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> protects the EL layer <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight> from moisture, and also may be formed so as to have a heat-dissipating function, as necessary, in the same manner as that of the second passivation film <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. Additionally, when an organic material is used as the EL layer, since the organic material may be degraded due to bonding with oxygen, preferably, an insulating film which easily emits oxygen is not used as the third passivation film <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, TFTs having the optimum configuration are directly formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the drive circuits <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> in addition to in the display region V, and thus high reliability is achieved with respect to operation. Additionally, herein, examples of drive circuits include shift registers, buffers, level shifters, and sampling circuits. When digital drive is employed, signal-converting circuits, such as D/A converters may also be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> In addition to the display region V and the circuit configuration, such as drive circuits <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, logic circuits, such as signal split circuits, D/A converter circuits, operational amplifier circuits, and g correction circuits, may be formed directly on the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Moreover, memory sections, microprocessors, etc., may be formed directly on the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Since the EL device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment has the construction described above, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, either one of a scanning signal and a data signal is supplied to the gate line <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> by the gate drive circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and the other one of a scanning signal and a data signal is supplied to the source line <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> by the source drive circuit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a current to make the EL device emit light is supplied to the current-controlling TFT <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in each display dot <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> by the current-supplying line <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Some display dots among a plurality of display dots arrayed in a matrix in the display region V are selected appropriately, and during the period of selection, the switching TFT <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is turned on, and thus the data voltage is written. During the period of non-selection, the TFT is turned off, and thus the voltage is maintained. Due to such switching and storing operations, some display dots among a plurality of display dots selectively emit light, and by the set of light-emitting dots, images, such as characters, numeric characters, and graphics are displayed toward the back of the sheet in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, i</cross-reference>.e., in the direction indicated by the arrow Q in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. Since light from the EL device <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> passes through the color filter substrate <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the display image is a color image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.

<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> While a film is exposed to light by the light figure of an object in the ordinary camera, in the digital still camera <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, the light image of an object is photoelectrically converted by an imaging device, such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) to generate imaging signals. Herein, a liquid crystal panel of the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is provided on the back face (front side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) of a case <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> of the digital still camera <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, and a display is performed based on the imaging signal by the CCD. Consequently, the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> functions as a finder for displaying an object.

<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> When a photographer confirms the image of the object displayed on the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and pushes a shutter <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight>, the imaging signal of the CCD at that point is transferred to and stored in the memory of a circuit substrate <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight>. In this digital still camera <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, video signal output terminals <highlight><bold>2212</bold></highlight> and input/output terminal <highlight><bold>2214</bold></highlight> for data communication are provided on the side of the case <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, as necessary, a TV monitor <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> can be connected to the signal output terminals <highlight><bold>2212</bold></highlight>, and a personal computer <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> is connected to the input/output terminal <highlight><bold>2214</bold></highlight> for data communication. Furthermore, by predetermined operation, the image signal stored in the memory of the circuit substrate <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight> is output to the TV monitor <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> and the personal computer <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>(A), (B), and (C) are outline views of other electronic apparatuses including liquid crystal display devices as the electro-optical devices according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(A) shows a mobile phone <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, which includes a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> provided on the upper front surface thereof. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(B) shows a wristwatch <highlight><bold>4000</bold></highlight>, which includes a display section using a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> provided on the center front surface of the body thereof. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(C) shows a mobile information apparatus <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>, which includes a display section including a liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and an input section <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> These electronic apparatuses include, besides the liquid crystal display devices <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, display signal generation sections which include display information output sources, various circuits, such as display information processing circuits and clock generation circuits, and power supply circuits for supplying power to such circuits, although now shown in the figure. For example, in the mobile information apparatus <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>, display signals generated by the display signal generation section based on information, etc. input from the input section <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight> are supplied to the display section, and thus a display image is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the electronic apparatuses in which the liquid crystal display device <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> of the present invention is built are not limited to digital still cameras, mobile phones, wristwatches, and mobile information apparatuses, and are also used for various other electronic apparatuses, such as electronic pocket diaries, pagers, POS terminals, IC cards, minidisk players, liquid crystal projectors, personal computers (PCs) for multi-media use, engineering workstations (EWSs), notebook type personal computers, word processors, televisions, viewfinder type or monitor-direct-view type video tape recorders, electronic desktop calculators, car navigating apparatuses, apparatuses provided with touch panels, clocks and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> As described above, in accordance with the present invention, since the delimiting member is composed of a resin having repellency to the color pixel material and the protective layer material, and the surface of the delimiting member is subjected to surface treatment to decrease the repellency to the liquid material for the protective layer, the protective layer constituting the color filter substrate can be formed so that the surface thereof has excellent flatness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when electrodes are formed on the surface of the color filter substrate, disconnection of the electrodes can be effectively prevented. When the color filter substrate is used as an element for a display device, it is possible to reduce variations in color tone in the image displayed by the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, preferred embodiments of the invention as set forth herein are intended to be illustrative not limiting. There are changes that may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
