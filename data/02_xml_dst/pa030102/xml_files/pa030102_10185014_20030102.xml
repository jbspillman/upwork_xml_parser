<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a subfield coding circuit and a subfield coding method for converting R, G, and B image data into subfield-coded data in a plasma display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of important characteristics required for a terminal unit such as a computer to have is a characteristic of displaying gradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a display unit such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) which can be controlled in its operation in analogue manner, it would be possible to control an electron beam current by applying a voltage of an input signal to a grid without deforming a waveform of the voltage. Since a brightness is defined by an intensity of an electron beam current, it would be possible to continuously control gradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a display unit which displays images in binary code, such as a plasma display unit which display images by means of memory effect, gradation is displayed in a particular way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow is explained the above-mentioned particular way in which gradation is displayed in a plasma display unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For instance, it would be possible in a printer to apparently increase a number of gradation by means of error diffusion. However, the error diffusion is accompanied with a problem of little practicability, because it would be necessary to fabricate a cell having high definition, if both of desired gradation and desired resolution were to be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a display unit which displays images in a binary code, a subfield process is usually carried out for displaying images. A subfield process is applicable to a display unit having a high response speed, such as a plasma display unit. In a subfield process, an image signal is quantized or converted into a digital form from an analogue form, and then, data about obtained one field is displayed in time division in each of gradation bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a subfield process, one field period is divided into a plurality of segmented fields each of which is called &ldquo;subfield&rdquo; and each of which weighted by the number of light emission in association with each of gradation bits. Then, images are successively reproduced by means of the thus obtained subfields, and images across one field are accumulated by visual integration effect. This results in images having natural intermediate gradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For instance, when an image is to be displayed in sixty-four gradation in a subfield process, an analogue image signal input into a display unit is quantized or analogue-to-digital converted into a brightness signal having six bits in association with gradation brightness data in which a brightness is different twice in a level from others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The thus quantized image signal data is accumulated in a frame buffer memory. Assuming that the most significant bit (MSB) which means a bit having the highest brightness is represented as B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and bits having lower brightness than the most significant bit are represented as B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a brightness ratio among those bits is represented as 32:16:8:4:2:1. Each of pixels selects one of those bits, and resultingly, an image can be displayed in sixty four gradation, that is, in the level of brightness 0 to brightness 63. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow is explained a subfield process, for instance, in AC type color plasma display unit in which scanning electrodes and sustaining electrodes are driven independently of each other, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One field is usually designed to be about one sixtieth in order to avoid flickers from appearing. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, one field is divided into six subfields, a first subfield SF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a sixth subfield SF<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, each comprised of a scanning period and a charging period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a scanning period of the first subfield SF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, data is written into each of pixels in accordance with data about the uppermost bit B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After data has been written into all pixels, a charge pulse is applied entirely to a panel for causing pixels into which data has been written, to emit a light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Then, pixels are driven in the second subfield SF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the subsequent subfields SF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to SF<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the same way as the first subfield SF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure a sufficient brightness, for instance, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16 and 8 pulses are applied to a panel for light emission in each of charging periods in the first to sixth subfields SF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SF<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Pixels are driven substantially in the same way as mentioned above also in a process in which a scanning step and a charging step are carried out in combination, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, and in a process in which a scanning step and a charging step are successively carried out in combination across fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The reason of selecting a subfield process is necessity of modulating a brightness of an emitted light and the number of light emission with a period of time in which a light is emitted. In order to carry out scanning a plurality of times in one field, it is necessary to scan pixels and write data into pixels in a short period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With significant progress in performance of writing data into a plasma display panel, it is now possible to write data in 3 microseconds or smaller. Thus, it is presently possible to display images in full color in 256 gradation by means of eight subfields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned subfield process, subfield coding is carried out for charging to sustain image signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partial circuit diagram of a conventional subfield coding circuit to carry out subfield coding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A subfield coding circuit is fabricated as one of circuits constituting a LSI, and, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is comprised of a first static random access memory (SRAM) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a second static random access memory <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a third static random access memory <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Each of the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is designed to have one port and acts as a memory for carrying out subfield conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first SRAM <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a look-up table (LUT) for red (R) signals, the second SRAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a look-up table for green (G) signals, and the third SRAM <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes a look-up table for blue (B) signals. Data about subfield coding is written in advance into each of the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from an external memory (not illustrated) such as EEPROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> receive R, G and B image data, respectively. On receipt of the R, G and B image data, an address in the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is designated (herein, the address is common to the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), and resultingly, subfield coding data is read out of each of the look-up tables included in the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. As a result, subfield conversion is carried out to each of the R, G and B image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The thus subfield-converted R, G and B image data is output from the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The conventional subfield coding circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is designed to include three look-up tables in association with R, G and B image data in order to carry out subfield conversion. As a result, the conventional subfield coding circuit unavoidably has high capacity as total capacity of the first to third SRAMs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in proportion to the number of look-up tables. This further results in a large size in a LSI including a subfield coding circuit, and an increase in fabrication costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-276540 (A) has suggested a gamma correcting circuit including a first circuit which switches an input port among a first input terminal through which a red signal is input, a second input terminal through which a green signal is input, and a third input terminal through which a blue signal is input, concurrently switches an output port among a first output terminal through which a red signal is output, a second output terminal through which a green signal is output, and a third output terminal through which a blue signal is output, gamma-corrects a signal received through the switched input terminal, in accordance with a coefficient read out of a memory, latching circuits each of which is electrically connected to the first to third output terminals and which latches the input signal for a certain period of time, a clock circuit which transmits a clock signal as a reference signal, and a controller which transmits a control signal at a timing of one-third of the clock signal. The input and output ports in the first circuit are switched in accordance with the control signal transmitted from the controller. Each of the latching circuits latches the input signals until a signal is input into a final latching circuit. When a signal is input into the final latching circuit, each of the latching circuits all transmit signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-56292 (A) has suggested an image processor which converts an input color image signal in a certain color space into an output color image signal in another color space, and outputs the converted color image signal. The image processor is comprised of tables each associated with each of colors in the output color image signal, and each used for converting the input color image signal into color data of the output color image signal, a data selector which repeatedly selects data associated with a color of the output color image signal, from the tables, and a color converter which converts the input color image signal into the output color image signal by means of data selected by the data selector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-124001 (A) has suggested a method of displaying gradation in a display unit, including the steps of dividing one field period into a plurality of subfields having a relative brightness ratio different from one another, and displaying an image having gradation in accordance with combination of brightness of each of the subfields. Assuming that the number of all gradation bits is equal to N wherein N is a positive integer equal to or greater than three, a subfield of a M-th gradation bit is arranged almost at the center of a time axis in all subfield periods. Herein, M is a positive integer, indicates an uppermost bit when M is equal to one, and is equal to or smaller than N. A subfield of at least two gradation bits among gradation bits other than the above-mentioned M-th gradation bit is divided into subfields presenting almost the same light-emission brightness, and the thus divided subfields are arranged at opposite sides of the subfield associated with the M-th gradation bit, in linear symmetry about the time axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-98959 (A) has suggested a display unit which divides a field into a plurality of subfields, and displays gradation by emitting a light and stopping light emission in a display period in each of the subfields. The display unit is comprised of first means for assigning optimal light-emission pattern to each of the subfields in order to suppress generation of pseudo-frame, based on data about image signals in a field period, and second means for converting image signals into light-emission pattern data in accordance with a control signal transmitted from the first means. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In view of the above-mentioned problems in the conventional subfield coding circuit, it is an object of the present invention to provide a subfield coding circuit which can prevent an increase in capacity of memories such as SRAMs constituting a subfield coding circuit, and further prevent an increase in a chip size of a LSI including the subfield circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a subfield coding method which can do the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a subfield coding circuit which subfield-converts R, G, and B image data for producing subfield-converted image data, including (a) a multiplexer which multiplexes R, G, and B image data, (b) a memory including a single lookup table through which the R, G, and B image data is converted into subfield-coded data in time-division, and (c) a demultiplexer which demultiplexes the subfield-coded data to output subfield-coded R, G, and B image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For instance, the memory may be comprised of a static random access memory (SRAM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the subfield coding circuit in accordance with the present invention, R, G and B image data are input into the multiplexer prior to being subfield-converted, and multiplexed. The thus multiplexed R, G and B image data are stored in the memory, and then, converted into subfield-coded data in turn in time division. The thus subfield-converted R, G and B image data are output from the memory in multiplexed form, and then, input into the demultiplexer. The subfield-converted R, G and B image data are demultiplexed in the demultiplexer, and then, output from the demultiplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, though a conventional subfield coding circuit was necessary to include three look-up tables, the subfield coding circuit in accordance with the present invention makes it possible to reduce the number of requisite look-up tables to one from three, because subfield conversion of R, G, and B image data is carried out in time division in a single look-up table. As a result, the subfield coding circuit in accordance with the present invention prevents an increase in capacity of a memory constituting a subfield coding circuit. Specifically, the present invention can reduce a memory capacity down to one-third of a capacity of a memory used in a conventional subfield coding circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, it is not necessary to carry out subfield coding in R, G and B image data independently of one another, and subfield coding may be carried out commonly to R, G and B image data. Accordingly, subfield coding may be carried out to R, G and B image data by means of a single look-up table by carrying out subfield data conversion at a data rate three times greater than a data rate of input R, G and B image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a subfield coding method for subfield-converting R, G, and B image data to produce subfield-converted image data, including the steps of (a) multiplexing R, G, and B image data, (b) converting the thus multiplexed R, G, and B image data into subfield-coded data in time-division, and (c) demultiplexing the subfield-coded data to output subfield-coded R, G, and B image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For instance, the step (b) may be carried out by means of a lookup table equipped in a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned method in accordance with the present invention provides the same advantages as the advantages provided by the above-mentioned subfield coding circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plasma display panel including a subfield coding circuit which is comprised of (a) a multiplexer which multiplexes R, G, and B image data, (b) a memory including a single lookup table through which the R, G, and B image data is converted into subfield-coded data in time-division, and (c) a demultiplexer which demultiplexes the subfield-coded data to output subfield-coded R, G, and B image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects and advantageous features of the present invention will be made apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The subfield coding circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the embodiment operates as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The multiplexer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives R, G and B image data, and multiplexes them. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, data including R, G and B image data in mixture has a length of 1 Tclk. Herein, Tclk means a reference period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Then, R, G and B image data in multiplexed condition are input into the memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By designating an address in the memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in turn, the R, G and B image data having been input into the memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reads subfield coding data out of the look-up table included in the memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, subfield conversion is carried out to each of the R, G and B image data. That is, each of the R, G and B image data is subfield-coded in this order in time division. In other words, the R, G and B image data are converted into subfield-coded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Each of the thus subfield-coded R, G and B image data has a length of &frac13; Tclk. That is, each of the thus subfield-coded R, G and B image data has a data rate which is three times greater than a data rate of the R, G and B image data before subfield-coded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The thus subfield-coded R, G and B image data in multiplexed condition are output from the memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and input into the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The subfield-coded R, G and B image data are demultiplexed in the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and output from the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> separately from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Each of the subfield-converted R, G and B image data has a length of 1 Tclk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the conventional subfield coding circuit was necessary to include three look-up tables. In contrast, the subfield coding circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the embodiment makes it possible to reduce the number of requisite look-up tables to one from three, because subfield conversion of R, G, and B image data is carried out in time division in the single look-up table. As a result, the subfield coding circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the embodiment prevents an increase in capacity of a memory constituting a subfield coding circuit. Specifically, the subfield coding circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can reduce a memory capacity down to one-third of a capacity of a memory used in the conventional subfield coding circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Thus, it would be possible to prevent an increase in a chip size of a LSI including the subfield coding circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the embodiment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the divided subfields as mentioned above ensures that a center of a period of time in which light emission is conducted in all of the gradation bits is common, and hence, symmetric property is ensured. </paragraph>
