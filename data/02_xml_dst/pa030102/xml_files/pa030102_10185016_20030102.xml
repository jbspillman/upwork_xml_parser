<heading lvl="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119 from our two applications ECCENTRIC ROTOR HAVING HIGH DENSITY MEMBER, MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF, AND FLAT CORELESS VIBRATOR MOTOR USING THE ECCENTRIC ROTOR filed with the Japanese Patent Office on Jun. 29, 2001, and duly assigned serial Nos. 2001-199603 and 2001-199604. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an eccentric rotor having a high density member for a vibrator motor as a silent call means of a portable communications device, a manufacturing method thereof, and a flat coreless vibrator motor using the eccentric rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As silent call means of portable communications devices such as pagers or mobile phones, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an eccentric weight W formed of tungsten alloy is arranged at an output shaft S of a cylindrical DC motor M and vibration is generated by using a centrifugal force of the eccentric weight W during rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, adding the eccentric weight W at the output shaft S as above limits its design due to a space in which the eccentric weight W rotates. Also, since tungsten alloy which is expensive is used, a manufacturing cost increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present applicant proposed to remove the output shaft and make the included rotor itself eccentric. A flat motor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. hei 8-10972 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,239 and Canada Patent No. 2,017,395). A cylindrical coreless vibrator motor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No hei 2-309070 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,155). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In these motors, since no output shaft and eccentric weight are provided, there is no limit to design, it is easy to use, and no danger exists during rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Since an output shaft is not needed, the vibrator motor including an eccentric rotor is a so-called shaft fixed type motor in which a shaft is fixed to a housing. The shaft fixed type motor is proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Publication No. hei 6-81443 and Japanese Patent No. 2,872,623. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Since the above motors have very thin coreless coils, they should be handled carefully. Also, since all the motors need molding processes, the number of parts or processing steps increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Recently, as portable devices are made smaller, more compact vibrator motors are required. For a flat type motor, a motor having a diameter less than 10 mm is required. With the above size motor, a sufficient vibration amount cannot be obtained since the amount of movement of the center of gravity in a radial direction obtained by simply making air-core armature coils eccentric is not great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As a result, a resin which has a high density by increasing the amount of mixture of tungsten alloy must be used. However, in this case, since a value of resistance of a resin portion is lowered, unnecessary current flows through the resin portion and thus consumption of current increases. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To solve the above-described problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an eccentric rotor having a high density member suitable for a vibrator motor which is ultra-compact and simultaneously provides a great amount of movement of the center of gravity in a radial direction so that a desired vibration amount can be obtained and further secures insulation between an air-core armature coil or printed wired commutator and resin so that consumption of current is not scarified while employing a high density member comprising metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing the above eccentric rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a flat coreless vibrator motor adopting the above eccentric rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is still an object of the present invention to provide a bearing for the rotor having a low coefficient of dynamic friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, there is provided an eccentric rotor having a high density member comprising a rotor base having an air-core armature coil installation surface, a bearing holder provided at a center thereof, and an air-core armature coil position determination guide formed of a high density member including metal, having a specific gravity of 6 or more and arranged to be eccentric outside of the bearing holder, an air-core armature coil arranged at the air-core armature coil position determination guide, a printed wired commutator member installed to insulate a conductive portion having electric potential from the high density member, and an end connection pattern, in which ends of the air-core armature coil are connected, installed at the printed wired commutator member inside an outer circumference of rotation at a position not overlapping the air-core armature coil. In this case, a desired amount of vibration can be obtained by sufficiently securing the amount of movement of the center of gravity in a radial direction while the eccentric rotor is ultra-small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment of the present invention, the bearing holder and the air-core armature coil position determination guide are formed of resin including tungsten alloy, having a density of 6 through 10 and a dynamic friction coefficient of 0.5 (1.5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) or less, and the resin itself functions as a bearing. In this case, the resin itself can work as a bearing. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to provide with an additional bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment of the present invention, the bearing holder and the air-core armature coil position determination guide are formed of resin including tungsten alloy, having a density of 6 or more, and an additional bearing is arranged at a center of the bearing holder. In this embodiment, an eccentric rotor having a low dynamic friction coefficient can be realized while using a bearing holder having a high specific gravity and a high density. In this embodiment, the additional bearing is a metal sintered oilless bearing which is integrally formed with the bearing holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is preferred in the present invention that the air-core armature coil position determination guide guides by using an inner or outer diameter of the air-core armature coil, and an air-core armature coil end guiding portion of the air-core armature coil is provided inside the outer circumference of rotation. In this case, the determination of the position of the air-core armature coil is made easy and a problem of disconnection of the end of the air-core armature coil does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To achieve the second object according to the first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing an eccentric rotor comprising the steps of molding a rotor base which includes an air-core armature coil installation surface, a bearing holder at a center thereof, and an air-core armature coil position determination guide formed of a high density member, including metal having a specific gravity of 6 or more and arranged to be eccentric outside of the bearing holder, arranging the air-core armature coil at the air-core armature coil position determination guide, installing a printed wired commutator member at the rotor base such that a conductive portion having electric potential is insulated from the high density member, connecting ends of the air-core armature coil to an end connection pattern installed at the printed wired commutator member and inside an outer circumference of rotation at the position not overlapping the air-core armature coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To achieve the second object according to the second embodiment according to the present invention, the above eccentric rotor can be manufactured by a method which comprises the steps of forming an eccentric rotor base by integrally molding a bearing holder at a center thereof and an air-core armature coil position determination guide outside the bearing holder by using a high density member including metal having a specific gravity of 6 or more which is the same as the bearing holder, arranging a sintered oilless bearing at the center of the rotor base, inserting an air-core armature coil around the air-core armature coil position determination guide, installing a printed wired commutator member such that a conductive portion having electric potential does not contact the rotor base, and connecting ends of the air-core armature coil to an end connection pattern installed at the printed wired commutator member and inside an outer circumference of rotation at the position not overlapping the air-core armature coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> To achieve the third object, there is provided a flat coreless vibrator motor comprising an eccentric rotor comprising a rotor base having an air-core armature coil installation surface, a bearing holder provided at a center thereof, and an air-core armature coil position determination guide formed of a high density member, including metal having a specific gravity of 6 or more and arranged to be eccentric outside of the bearing holder, an air-core armature coil arranged at the air-core armature coil position determination guide, a printed wired commutator member installed to insulate a conductive portion having electric potential from the high density member, and an end connection pattern, in which ends of the air-core armature coil are connected, installed at the printed wired commutator member inside an outer circumference of rotation at a position not overlapping the air-core armature coil, a magnet installed to face the eccentric rotor with a gap, a brush arranged inside the magnet for providing electric power to the eccentric rotor, a shaft for rotatably supporting the eccentric rotor, and a housing for housing the eccentric rotor, the magnet, the brush, and the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is preferred in the present invention that the eccentric rotor is assembled such that the air-core armature coil faces the magnet.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a rotor base formed of high density slippery resin which is a mixture of tungsten alloy and polyamide and has a specific gravity of 8, a dynamic friction coefficient of about 0.4 (1.5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). The rotor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is injection-molded to include all of a bearing holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a bearing hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at the center thereof, two aircore armature coil position determination guides <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>arranged outside the bearing holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and three poles <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>where printed wired commutators that are described later are installed. The rotor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an air-core armature coil installation surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>where air-core armature coils that are described later are installed around the two air-core armature coil position determination guides <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and a weight portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>having a gingko leaf shape where the position of part of the outer diametric portion of the air-core armature coil is determined when the air-core armature coil is installed. Also, the outer diametric portion of the bearing holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>restricts the position of the air-core armature coil when the air-core armature coil is installed. Likewise, the outer diametric portion may be used as the air-core armature coil position determination guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>denotes an air-core armature coil end guiding groove arranged at the bearing holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>denotes a dam portion which sliding-contacts a case <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is part of a housing H when the rotor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> completed as an eccentric rotor to be described later is assembled to a motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The high density member can be formed to exhibit a specific gravity of 8 to 14.5. When the specific gravity of the high density member is less than 8, the amount of tungsten alloy employed decreases. Accordingly, in the first embodiment of the present invention, since a dynamic friction coefficient of about 0.4 (1.5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) can be obtained, the high density member can directly support a rotation shaft without using a sintered oilless bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To manufacture an eccentric rotor by using the rotor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, first, an air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inserted around the air-core armature coil position determination guide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the rotor base <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed by melting the upper portion of the air-core armature coil position determination guide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>or coating the air-core armature coil installation surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>with an adhesive. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fixed by inserting a pole passing hole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>around the pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in a state of avoiding a portion having an electric potential to insulate from the high density member and melting the upper portion of the pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Ends <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to an end connection pattern <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed on the printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. End connection pattern <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is not disposed at location that overlaps air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. End connection pattern <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is also disposed at a location opposite the center of gravity of the rotor while being inside the outer circumference of rotation. End connection pattern <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed on a surface of printed wired commutation member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is opposite to a surface of printed wired commutation member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> where segments <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>are located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Here, the printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a shaft insertion hole at the center thereof and is formed circular viewed from the above. Six segments <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>having surfaces processed with noble metals and forming a flat commutator are arranged on one side of the printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A conductive body electrically connecting the segments <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>facing each other through through holes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed at the rear surface of the printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an example of a modified eccentric rotor according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, to increase a centrifugal force, the rotor base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed of high density resin having a specific gravity of <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the amount of tungsten alloy is increased. Here, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a sleeve type sintered oilless bearing inserted in a bearing installation hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which is enlarged. The sleeve type sintered oilless bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted because, since the resin forming the rotor base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a high density resin having a specific gravity of 10 in which the amount of tungsten alloy is increased, when this resin also functions as a sliding bearing, a dynamic friction coefficient increases and the shaft is abraded and bearing loss is generated. Therefore, sintered oilless bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is employed to reduce friction when the tungsten composition is high as in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The method of manufacturing the eccentric rotor according to the first embodiment of the present invention is summarized as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> (2) The air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged at the air-core armature coil position determination guide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and fixed by melting the upper portion of the guide <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>or using an adhesive in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> (3) The printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted around the respective poles <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and fixed by crushing the upper portion of each pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The fixing step is performed so that a conductive portion of the commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having electric potential is electrically insulated from the high density member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> (4) The ends <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the air-core armature coil are connected to an end connection pattern <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed on the printed wired commutator member <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inside the outer circumference of rotation at a location that does not overlap the air-core armature coil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thus completing an eccentric rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing the rotor according to the second embodiment of the present invention, a sleeve type oilless bearing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed inside bearing holder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of rotor base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A flat coreless vibrator motor adopting the eccentric rotor R is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The eccentric rotor R is housed in a housing H formed of a case <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a bracket <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The eccentric rotor R is inserted around a shaft J fixed at the center of the bracket <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be capable of rotating through the bearing hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The eccentric rotor R receives electric power through a brush <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> arranged at the bracket <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and contacting the printed wired commutator member to be capable of sliding and is driven by a flat magnet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Since the bearing hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a middle recess portion c of several micrometers formed in the middle thereof, frictional bearing loss is reduced. The middle recess portion c can be easily formed by using a difference in the contraction rate of resin since the middle portion of the resin bearing holder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is thick, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Also, the bearing hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>including the middle recess portion c can be formed by using a mold pin having a shape corresponding to the middle recess portion of several micrometers and being forcibly detached from the bearing hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>after molding. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> denotes a brush base formed of epoxy base having a thickness of 0.1 mm for providing electric power from the outside, where the brush <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the eccentric rotor according to the present invention, a desired amount of vibration can be obtained by sufficiently securing the amount of movement of the center of gravity in a radial direction while the eccentric rotor is ultra-small. Although the high density member including metal is used, insulation between the air-core armature coil or printed wired commutator and resin can be obtained. Also, the air-core armature coil can be easily installed and the ends of the coil can be processed so that electrical contact with the end connection pattern of the commutator member is maintained. Thus, a compact flat vibrator motor can be provided at a low price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
