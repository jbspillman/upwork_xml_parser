<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser module in which a semiconductor laser chip and an optical fiber are optically coupled. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor laser module having an optical coupling mechanism suppressing light that is reflected back from the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the course of the development of optical fiber communication networks, optical communication systems with high quality over long distances have been put into practice. In particular in multi-channel CATV video transmissions, optical communication has become necessary and indispensable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram of a conventional optical communication system. This conventional optical communication system is a send-only system, in which video information is distributed from a broadcasting station (referred to as &ldquo;HE&rdquo; (head end) in the following) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the sending end to households <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the receiving end. Up to the branching points (referred to as &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; in the following) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the video information signals distributed from the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are optical signals, transmitted over an optical fiber, and from the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the households <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, they are electrical signals, transmitted over a coaxial cable. A DFB (distributed feedback) laser is used as the semiconductor laser for transmitting the signals in the optical fiber. DFB lasers emit at a single wavelength, so that noise is low, and there is little signal degradation even for long-distance fiber transmissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the structure of a conventional semiconductor laser module. The following is an explanation of a conventional semiconductor laser module, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This semiconductor laser module uses a DFB laser. Inside a package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> outputting DFB laser light, a photo diode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> monitoring the output from the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an aspheric lens <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> condensing the laser light that is output from the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to couple it into the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for attenuating the light that is reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a thermistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for detecting the temperature of the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are arranged on a metal base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is placed on a Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Here, the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> lets laser light pass from the laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but attenuates laser light coming in the other direction from the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, made of a Peltier element, controls the temperature of the components on the base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to a certain temperature via the base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The characteristics of the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> change with the temperature, so they are controlled to the optimum temperature. Furthermore, the temperature is detected by the thermistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through which laser light is emitted to the outside. Moreover, a metal lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer side of the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is filled with inert gas, and a cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is welded to the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such that the inert gas does not leak out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is held by a ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is a stainless steel tube. After the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has been centered through the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> such that the laser light emitted through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coupled with high efficiency, the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is held in place by fastening by YAG welding the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the metal lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There are two transmission methods for transmitting DFB laser light over an optical fiber. One is direct modulation, in which the DFB laser is directly modulated, and the other is external modulation, in which the DFB laser is driven by a constant current, and modulated by an external modulator optically connected to the after emitting the laser light from the DFB laser module. Differing from direct modulation, there is no laser chirp with external modulation, so that long-distance transmissions of higher quality become possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When using direct modulation, a single mode fiber is used for the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When using external modulation, a polarization maintaining fiber is used, which can transmit laser light while maintaining its polarization, in order to increase the optical coupling efficiency with the external modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor laser module with the above configuration, the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is temperature-controlled in the same manner as the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that a stable optical isolation ratio can be obtained. Therefore, light reflected back from the optical fiber is reliably attenuated by the optical isolator, and noise due to reflected backlight hardly occurs. It should be noted that the above-described semiconductor laser module is disclosed in JP H3-178181A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, in the last couple of years, bi-directional optical communication systems, which can be used for the internet or the like, have been required more than send-only systems. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram of a bi-directional optical communication system using direct modulation. It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts only the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> serving as the first sending/receiving device and the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serving as the second sending/receiving devices, and the households following the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have been omitted. As in the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, also in the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are linked by an optical transmission path such as an optical fiber. The aspect where the system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> differs from the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is that bi-directional communication (i.e. sending and receiving) between the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The signals from a sending portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are converted from electric signals to optical signals by a DFB laser module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and sent to the receiving portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, where they are converted back from optical signals to electric signals. Furthermore, the optical signals sent from the DFB laser modules <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are converted back into electric signals by the light-receiving portions <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and sent to the receiving portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the DFB laser modules <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> do not send a signal, they are simply in a DC driven (unmodulated) state, and the light reflected back from the optical fiber causes noise in the low-frequency region. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the low-frequency noise for a bi-directional optical communication system using an unmodulated DFB laser module. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it can be seen that spike-shaped noise occurs in the low-frequency region. The HE <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> converts the optical signals from the nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> summarily into electric signals and sends them to the receiving portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so that when signals at frequencies or near the frequencies at which this noise occurs are sent by other nodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, those signals are affected by this noise. That is to say, the transmission characteristics of the video or data are deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the deterioration of the transmission characteristics, it is necessary to reduce the reflected backlight more than in conventional semiconductor modules. This is achieved mainly by the following two methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A first method is to improve the resistance against reflected backlight by always applying a modulation signal of a different signal frequency than that usually used in the upstream laser. However, with this method, the design of the electric circuit of the entire system needs to be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A second method is to use laser modules that provide sufficient optical isolation against light returning from the optical fiber. This method can be accomplished without modifying the system itself, and exchanging only the DFB laser modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it is easier to employ the second method as a method to prevent the deterioration of transmission characteristics when changing from a conventional send-only system to a bi-directional system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the reflection attenuation on ordinary optical transmission paths is about &minus;30 dB with respect to the output from the DFB laser module, although this also depends on the kind and number of connectors spliced in between. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the relationship between noise and the optical isolation ratio of the DFB module when the reflection attenuation on the transmission path is &minus;30dB. It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> that when the optical isolation ratio is 40 dB or more, then noise is reduced considerably, and when it is 45 dB or more, noise is virtually non-existent. In practice, it is desirable that the noise is not greater than 5 dB, so that an optical isolation ratio of at least 38 dB is necessary, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the oscillation peak wavelength of the laser is that of the maximum value of the optical isolation ratio of the optical isolator, then an optical isolation ratio of at least 38 dB is no problem even with a single-stage optical isolator as used conventionally. However, in practice, due to variations of the laser wavelength and individual differences between optical isolators, it is difficult to ensure an optical isolation ratio of 40 dB or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Ordinary optical isolators are of the single-stage type, but optical isolators with better characteristics are of the 1.5-stage type. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a lateral cross-sectional view of a 1.5-stage optical isolator. Ordinary single-stage optical isolators are made of a Faraday rotator sandwiched between two polarizers, and a magnet applying a magnetic field to the Faraday rotator. The 1.5-stage optical isolator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> includes three polarizers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, two Faraday rotators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> arranged between the polarizers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and magnets <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> applying a magnetic field on the Faraday rotators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to control the rotation angle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the wavelength characteristics of the optical isolation ratio. The circles denote the characteristics of a single-stage optical isolator, and the triangles denote the characteristics of a 1.5-stage optical isolator. It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, that the optical isolation of a 1.5-stage optical isolator is well above 50 dB. Using a 1.5-stage optical isolator, the problem of noise can be solved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, 1.5-stage optical isolators are, due to their structure, longer with respect to the light propagation direction than single-stage optical isolators. For this reason, when they are used instead of the optical isolators of the conventional semiconductor modules in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, they touch against the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Even when trying to move the other components in order to fit all into the same package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there will be laser light that cannot be passed through the optical isolator, because the diameter of the light bundle on the side of the aspheric lens is too large compared to the effective diameter of the optical isolator. Thus, there is the problem that sufficient optical coupling cannot be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as another method for reducing the reflected backlight, there are optical fibers having an optical isolator attached to their end face, as disclosed in JP H06-88926A. However, with this structure, the optical isolator is not temperature-controlled, so that the optical isolation ratio is required to be stable with respect to temperature. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows the temperature characteristics of the optical isolation ratio of optical isolators. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, it can be seen that single-stage optical isolators are instable with respect to temperature changes, whereas 1.5-stage optical isolators are stable with respect to temperature changes, and an optical isolation ratio of at least 45 dB can be ensured. Thus, stabilization with respect to temperature changes can be achieved by a configuration using a 1.5-stage optical isolator. Furthermore, with this configuration, when the optical isolator is placed at a position at which the laser light is sufficiently constricted, optical coupling losses do not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> However, since the 1.5 -stage optical isolator has a longer structure, the position of the focus of the emitted laser light must be sufficiently removed from the metal lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the optical isolator portion does not touch against the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the distance between the YAG welding joint of the metal lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the focus position becomes large. In that case, when stress deformations with respect to environmental temperature occur in the YAG welding joint, shifts of the focus position become larger than in the case of a single-stage optical isolator. Therefore, with this configuration, defects may occur with a system in which the environmental temperature changes significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, 1.5 -stage optical isolators are superior to single-stage optical isolators with regard to wavelength and temperature characteristics, but since they are structurally longer than single-stage optical isolators, the above-described problems occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when using not direct modulation but external modulation, an external modulator is connected in front of the DFB laser module, so that there are more reflections than with direct modulation. Consequently, a DFB laser module with a large optical isolation ratio is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor laser module and an optical transmission system, in which noise caused by backlight reflected from the transmission path can be suppressed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor laser module in accordance with the present invention includes a package, having a window, that is filled with an inert gas and that is sealed airtightly; a semiconductor laser chip outputting light; a lens that is optically designed such that it condenses light that is output from the semiconductor laser chip and couples the condensed light into an optical transmission path outside the window of the package; an optical isolator that is disposed between the lens and the window; a temperature control mechanism for keeping temperature of the semiconductor chip, the lens and the optical isolator constant; and a tubular ferrule that holds and covers the optical transmission path. The semiconductor laser chip, the lens, the optical isolator, and the temperature control mechanism are arranged inside the package, and a polarizer is arranged at an end face of the ferrule on a side of the package, such that the polarizer matches a polarization plane of the light that is emitted through the window of the package. With this configuration, reflected backlight can be attenuated by both the polarizer and the optical isolator, so that noise due to the reflected backlight can be reduced. Moreover, this semiconductor laser module can be obtained by a minor modification of a conventional semiconductor laser module, so that it can be realized easily and at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the optical transmission path is an optical fiber whose end face on the package side is obliquely ground. With this configuration, laser light emitted from the package can be optically coupled without being reflected at the optical fiber end face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the optical transmission path is a polarization maintaining fiber. Using a polarization maintaining fiber, the laser light can be transmitted while maintaining its polarization plane. Thus, if the laser light emitted from the semiconductor laser module is modulated by an external modulator, the laser light and external modulator can be optically coupled effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another semiconductor laser module in accordance with the present invention includes a package, having a window, that is filled with an inert gas and that is sealed airtightly; a semiconductor laser chip outputting light; a lens that is optically designed such that it condenses light that is output from the semiconductor laser chip and couples the condensed light into an optical transmission path outside the window of the package; an optical isolator that is disposed between the lens and the window; a temperature control mechanism for keeping temperature of the semiconductor chip, the lens and the optical isolator constant; and a tubular ferrule that holds and covers the optical transmission path. The semiconductor laser chip, the lens, the optical isolator, and the temperature control mechanism are arranged inside the package, and an external optical isolator is arranged at an end face of the ferrule on the side of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission path may be an optical fiber, whose end face on the package side is obliquely ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission path may be a polarization maintaining fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the external optical isolator includes a first polarizer that lets, of the laser light emitted from the package, only light with a certain polarization pass; a Faraday rotator that rotates the polarization plane of the light that has passed the first polarizer by a certain rotation angle; a magnet that applies a magnetic field to the Faraday rotator; and a second polarizer whose polarization plane matches the polarization plane of the light that passes the Faraday rotator. Thus, reflected backlight can be attenuated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of a semiconductor laser module in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention. The basic configuration of this semiconductor laser module according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention is similar to the conventional semiconductor laser module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as explained in the background art section. What is different is that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> polarizer is disposed at the ferrule end face. The following is an explanation of this semiconductor laser module according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, with reference to the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a package of the butterfly type. Numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a DFB laser chip outputting DFB laser light. Numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denotes a photo diode for monitoring the output from the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denotes an aspheric lens that is optically designed such that it converges the laser light that is output from the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and optically couples it into the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> arranged at the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a thermistor detecting temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> denotes a window that is provided such that the laser light that is output by the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is emitted to the outside from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The laser light is emitted to the outside from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a metal lid, which is arranged on the outer side of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and attached to the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> denotes an optical isolator, which is made of a Faraday rotator sandwiched between two polarizers and a magnet for applying a magnetic field to this Faraday rotator. The optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is disposed between the lens <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> passes laser light from the laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but it attenuates backlight traveling in the other direction that is reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the photo diode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the aspheric lens <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the thermistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are placed on a metal base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is placed on a Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the temperature detected by the thermistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> controls the temperature of the components on the base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to a constant temperature via the base <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the components placed on it are arranged inside the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After filling the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with an inert gas, it is welded shut with a cap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that the inert gas cannot leak out through it. Furthermore, since the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is very air-tight as well, the inert gas will not leak out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is held by a tubular ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of a stainless steel tube. The ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, starting from its end on the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side. Furthermore, after the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has been centered through the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> such that the laser light emitted through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coupled with high efficiency, the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is held in place by fastening by YAG welding the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the ferrule holder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the metal lid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the side of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged such it matches with the polarization plane of the laser light emitted from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An anti-reflection film is formed between the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in order to prevent multiple reflections. It is also possible to prevent multiple reflections by adhering the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by filling an adhesive between the two, using an adhesive whose refractive index is close to that of the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In order to suppress reflections of laser light, emitted through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, at the end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and to prevent multiple reflections between the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the side of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is ground obliquely. Moreover, the above-mentioned optical components arranged inside the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are adjusted and fixed obliquely, such that the laser light emitted through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coupled optimally into the obliquely ground optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The following is an explanation of the operation of a semiconductor laser module with the above-described structure. Laser light that is output from the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is condensed by the aspheric lens <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, passes through the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and is emitted through the window <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the outside of the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged to match the polarization plane of the emitted laser light, the emitted laser light passes through the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. After passing through the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the emitted laser light is optically coupled into the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and is transmitted by the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As explained above, multiple reflections at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> do not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, light is reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> into the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but this reflected backlight is polarized at random, so that only the correspondingly polarized components are selected when passing through the polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the optical intensity of the light that is reflected back into the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attenuated to {fraction (1/10)} of that in a conventional semiconductor laser module. Inside the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the reflected backlight is further attenuated by the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the characteristics of the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> change with temperature. Therefore, as explained above, the DFB laser chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are controlled by the Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the temperature at which they operate optimally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the wavelength characteristics of the optical isolation ratio of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the temperature characteristics of the optical isolation ratio of the present invention. It should be noted that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, black circles denote the characteristics of the Embodiment 1, and black triangles denote the characteristics of Embodiment 2, which is explained below. For comparison, the characteristics when using only a single-stage optical isolator (shown by circles) and the characteristics when using only a 1.5-stage optical isolator (shown by triangles), as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, are shown as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As becomes clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, an optical isolation ratio of at least 38 dB is attained with the semiconductor laser module of Embodiment 1, which is due to the effect of the providing a polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the effect of the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, noise occurring due to reflected backlight, which was a problem in the related art, can be suppressed. Moreover, the configuration of the semiconductor laser module of Embodiment 1 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is almost the same as the configuration of the conventional semiconductor laser module in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, so that a conventional semiconductor laser module easily can be modified into the semiconductor laser module of Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the above-described DFB laser module is used for the bi-directional optical communication system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is little reflected backlight, so that a high-quality optical transmission system with little noise can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the semiconductor laser module and optical transmission system in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention, a polarizer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached to the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that a DFB laser module is achieved, in which the light reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is attenuated, and noise is suppressed. Furthermore, this DFB laser module can be obtained using the structure of a conventional semiconductor laser module and without necessitating major modifications, so that it can be accomplished easily and at low cost. Also, a high-quality optical transmission system can be achieved by using this DFB laser module for a bi-directional optical communication system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a lateral cross-sectional view of the ferrule in Embodiment 2 of the present invention, and its surroundings. The basic configuration of the semiconductor laser module according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention is the same as that of the DFB laser module according to Embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. What is different is that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an optical isolator is disposed at the ferrule end face. The following is an explanation of the semiconductor laser module according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention, with reference to this figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the semiconductor laser module according to Embodiment 2, an external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> made of a first polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a magnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and a second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is disposed at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The first polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>lets only certain polarization components of the laser light emitted from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> pass. The Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rotates the laser light that has passed through the first polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by a predetermined rotation angle. The magnet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>applies a magnetic field to the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and controls the rotation angle. The polarization plane of the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is set to match the polarization plane of the laser light that has passed the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. With this configuration, the external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has the function that it lets laser light pass from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, but attenuates light that is reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is disposed at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but a reflection-preventing film is formed between the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in order to prevent multiple reflections between the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. It is also possible to prevent multiple reflections by adhering the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>by filling an adhesive between the two, using an adhesive whose refractive index is close to that of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the second polarizer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> After the laser light emitted to the outside from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has passed through the external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it is optically coupled into the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and transmitted by the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, light is reflected from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> back into the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but the reflected backlight of the laser light emitted from the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is attenuated by the external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and further attenuated by the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> inside the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show wavelength and temperature characteristics of the optical isolation ratio for this case. As above, the optical isolation ratio of Embodiment 2 is marked by black triangles in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in these drawings, due to the effect of the providing an external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the effect of the optical isolator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, characteristics that are superior to that of a 1.5-stage optical isolator can be attained, so that an optical isolation ratio that is stable over a broad range of temperatures and wavelengths can be achieved. Thus, the occurrence of noise, which is a problem in the related art, can be suppressed. Moreover, the configuration of the semiconductor laser module of Embodiment 2 is almost the same as the configuration of the conventional semiconductor laser module, so that the semiconductor laser module of the related art can be modified easily at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a sufficient optical isolation ratio can be attained with the semiconductor laser module of Embodiment 2, so that it is desirable to use it in particular with external modulation for long-distance transmissions. In external modulation, the laser light emitted from the DFB laser module is modulated by an external modulator. In this case, a polarization maintaining fiber is used for the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in order to increase the optical coupling with the external modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, when the above-described DFB laser module is used for the bi-directional optical communication system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is little reflected backlight, so that a high-quality optical transmission system with little noise can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the semiconductor laser module and optical transmission system according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention, an external optical isolator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus reducing the light that is reflected back from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and achieving a DFB laser module with which noise is suppressed. Furthermore, it can be accomplished using the structure of a conventional semiconductor laser module and without necessitating major modifications, so that it can be achieved easily and at low cost. Furthermore, a high-quality optical transmission system can be achieved by using this DFB laser module to configure a bi-directional optical communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As described above, in a semiconductor laser module in accordance with the present invention, in which laser light that is output from a semiconductor laser chip inside a package is emitted to the outside and optically coupled into a transmission path, a polarizer is disposed at the end face of the ferrule holding the optical transmission path on the package side, so that reflected backlight can be attenuated and noise can be suppressed. Furthermore, the semiconductor laser module can be realized using a conventional semiconductor laser module and without major modifications, so that it can be achieved easily and at low cost. Moreover, a high-quality optical transmission system can be achieved by using this semiconductor laser module to configure a bi-directional optical transmission system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments disclosed in this application are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
