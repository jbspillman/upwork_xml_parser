The seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a main inner diameter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> defined by the radially-inward edge of the first flange <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The main inner diameter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is sized slightly smaller than predetermined portions of the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to enable the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to move onto the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by way of an interference fit. The seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is axially dimensioned such that the surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is axially aligned with the resilient member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> abuts the receiving portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> after assembly of the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> onto the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The main inner diameter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sized approximately equal to or only slightly larger than the outer diameter of the receiving portion of the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Prior to insertion of the male member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is preferably, but not necessarily, disposed on the reduced diameter portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the male member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by interference fit. Preferably, but not necessarily, the diameter of the inner central aperture of the annular portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to or less than the outer diameter of the reduced diameter portion (tube) <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the male member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As a final assembly step, the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is simply axially pushed onto the receiving portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the female member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> until the surface <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is axially aligned with the resilient member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be assembled and disassembled without the use of any tools. The seal cap <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of a resilient material, is lightweight and takes relatively little space in the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that a person skilled in the art may make modifications to the specific embodiments shown herein within the scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
