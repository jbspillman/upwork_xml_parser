<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electric component cooling apparatus for cooling an electronic component such as an MPU or the like, and more particularly to an electronic component cooling apparatus of the type that a heat sink on which an electronic component is mounted is forcibly cooled by air fed from a fan unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an electronic component cooling apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 102787/2001 comprises a heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having a plurality of radiation fins <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a fan unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> including an impeller <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> driven by a motor and a casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and casing mounting means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> located at opposite sides of the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The casing mounting means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are provided to mount the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so that a gap is provided between the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and an opposite wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Air discharged from the impeller <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> passes through the gap formed between the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the opposite wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and through intervals between the radiation fins <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and then flows out to the outside of the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> mounted on a base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is thereby cooled. The electronic component cooling apparatus is mounted on a circuit board <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using mounting tools of various structures. Recently, a mounting tool such as a mounting tool <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, indicated by a dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, has also been conceived. In this example, a pushing force toward the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is applied to the opposite wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to push the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> against the electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thereby mounting the electronic component cooling device on the circuit board <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In this conventional electronic component cooling apparatus, however, a pushing force applied by the mounting tool <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is exerted on the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through the casing mounting means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> located on the opposite sides of the casing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In this case, a force exerted on the electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, based on the pushing force locally becomes larger or becomes unbalanced. In this case, for example, a large force is locally applied to an upper corner <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For this reason, unbalanced contact occurs between the electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heat sink <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, so that heat dissipation from the electronic component <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> becomes locally unbalanced, and the heat dissipation effect of the electronic component might be thereby reduced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing disadvantage of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic component cooling apparatus that can prevent a reduction in the heat dissipation effect of an electronic component when a pushing force toward a heat sink is exerted on the opposite wall of a casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic component cooling apparatus that can prevent extreme unbalance in contact between the base of a heat sink and an electronic component when a pushing force toward the heat sink is exerted on the opposite wall of a casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electronic component cooling apparatus that does not extremely increase air resistance against air that passes through a gap formed between the opposite wall of a casing and a plurality of radiation fins in a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an electronic component cooling apparatus comprises a heat sink, a fan unit, and casing mounting means. The heat sink has a base having a front surface provided thereon with a plurality of radiation fins and a rear surface to be mounted thereon with an electronic component to be cooled. The fan unit includes an impeller having a plurality of blades, a motor for rotating the impeller mounted on a rotor fixedly mounted on a revolving shaft, and a casing having an opposite wall arranged opposite to leading ends of the radiation fins in the heat sink, and an opening for receiving the impeller. The casing mounting means is provided to mount the casing on the heat sink so that the leading ends of the radiation fins are spaced from the opposite wall to define a gap. In this electronic component cooling apparatus, air discharged from the impeller passes through the gap between the heat sink and the leading ends of the radiation fins and through intervals between the radiation fins for discharge to the outside of the casing and the heat sink. Then, when the electronic component cooling apparatus is used, the base of the heat sink is pushed against the electronic component with the pushing force toward the heat sink being applied to a pair of wall sections of the opposite wall located with the opening of the casing interposed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, at least one pushing force transferring section for transferring the pushing force to the heat sink through contact with the leading ends of the radiation fins is integrally provided at each of a pair of wall sections of the opposite wall of the casing. Then, at least one pushing force transferring section at each of the pair of wall sections is constructed to distribute the pushing force and transfer distributed force to the heat sink so as to prevent a force applied or transferred to the electronic component by the pushing force from increasing locally and excessively, or being brought into an unbalanced state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If at least one pushing force transferring section is provided in accordance with the present invention, a pushing force is transferred to the heat sink through the casing mounting means and the pushing force transferring section, with the pushing force toward the hear sink applied to the pair of the wall sections of the opposite wall of the casing. Then, this pushing force is exerted on the electronic component through the heat sink. For this reason, the pushing force is distributed and the distributed force is transferred to the heat sink due to the existence of the pushing force transferring section, so that the force exerted on the electronic component will not increase locally and extremely. In other words, the balanced pushing force is exerted on the entire electronic component, thereby eliminating extreme unbalance in contact between the base of the heat sink and the electronic component. Consequently, an occurrence of local unbalance in heat dissipation of the electronic component can be prevented. A reduction in efficiency of heat dissipation can be thereby prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the cross sectional profile or shape of the pushing force transferring section is defined so as to reduce air resistance against the air that passes through the gap between the leading ends of the radiation fins and the opposite wall. This arrangement can streamline the airflow, which would be severely blocked due to the existence of the pushing force transferring section, thereby preventing the cooling effect of the radiation fins from decreasing. In this case, if the cross sectional profile of the pushing force transferring section is formed to have substantially a circular shape, air resistance can be reduced, and the mechanical strength of the pushing force transferring section can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, if an axial fan unit for discharging air in one axial direction of the revolving shaft of the motor is employed as the fan unit, it is preferable that the cross sectional shape of the pushing force transferring section is formed to have an elongate, streamlined shape so that it parallels airflow discharged from the fan unit and then passing through the gap or so that it does not make a large resistance against the airflow. With this arrangement, air resistance of the pushing force transferring section against airflow can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still further, when providing each of pushing force transferring sections for each of the pair of wall sections, it is preferable that the pushing force transferring sections are provided symmetrically on opposite sides of the opening formed in the opposite wall of the casing. With this arrangement, a force exerted on the electronic component becomes symmetrical with respect to the opening, so that the force distributed and then exerted on the electronic component is made to be balanced. Further, since two airflows flowing within the gap in two opposite directions with respect to the opening can be made to be symmetrical, the cooling effects of the radiation fins can be prevented from varying significantly. In order to attain possibly the best balanced contact between the base of the heat sink and the electronic component as well as the force distribution and exertion on the electronic component, the pushing force transferring sections should be respectively formed at the central portions of the pair of the wall sections of the opposite wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> More particularly, an electronic component cooling apparatus of the present invention comprises a heat sink having a base having a front surface provided thereon with a plurality of radiation fins and a rear surface to be mounted thereon with an electronic component to be cooled, a pair of heat sink side walls being upright from a pair of opposite ends of the base with the radiation fins interposed therebetween, and an axial fan unit. The fan unit includes an impeller having a plurality of blades, a motor for rotating the impeller mounted on a rotor fixedly mounted on a revolving shaft, a casing having an opposite wall arranged opposite to leading ends of the radiation fins in the heat sink with a gap, a pair of casing side walls extending to the heat sink from opposite edges of the opposite wall, and an opening for receiving the impeller and the motor, and a plurality of webs coupling a housing of the motor to the casing so that the motor is positioned at a central portion of the opening. The fan unit further includes casing mounting means for mounting the casing on the heat sink by engagement of engaging sections each provided on the pair of casing side walls with engaged sections each provided on the pair of heat sink side walls. Then, the casing and the heat sink are constructed to form a pair of openings which allow air, discharged from the impeller and passing through the gap and intervals between the radiation fins in the heat sink, to go out of the casing and the heat sink in two opposite directions for discharge. The base in the heat sink is pushed against the electronic component with the pushing force toward the heat sink being applied to a pair of wall sections of the opposite wall located in the two directions with the opening of the casing interposed therebetween. The pushing force transferring sections for transferring the pushing force to the heat sink through contact with the leading ends of the radiation fins are each integrally formed on each of the pair of wall sections of the opposite wall, and the pushing force transferring sections are constructed to distribute the pushing force and transfer distributed force to the heat sink so that a force applied to the electronic component through the casing mounting means, the pushing force transferring sections, and the heat sink based on the pushing force is not so unbalanced as to cause extreme unbalance in contact between the electronic component and the base of the heat sink.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now, an electronic component cooling apparatus according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an embodiment of the electronic component cooling apparatus according to the present invention is illustrated. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are a top plan view, a front elevation view, and a left side elevation view of the electronic component cooling apparatus according to the present invention, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a bottom plan view of a fan unit employed in this embodiment. As shown in the drawings, an electronic component cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment comprises a heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> integrally made of aluminum by extrusion molding and cutting and an axial fan unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a rectangular base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a pair of heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B integrally arranged on both sides of the base defined in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal (width) direction of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so as to extend toward the casing of the axial fan unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. An MPU, which is an electronic component to be cooled, may be mounted on/at the rear surface of the base through a holder, or may be mounted on the base directly using an adhesive. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is integrally provided on the surface of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. These radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are disposed at given intervals to be substantially parallel to each other in the width direction of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This is the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and that extends in parallel to the surface of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, or the direction in which a pair of the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B are arranged or oppositely disposed. The radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> each extend in the longitudinal direction of the base, while keeping a height thereof substantially unvaried. As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> each have such a shape that its width gradually tapers as it becomes distant from the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a plurality of parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed at predetermined intervals to extend in the longitudinal direction of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extend continuously from the outsides of a pair of the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B toward the inside of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for interrupting continuity of a part of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> adjacent to the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. The parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed by preforming the heat sink with no parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by extrusion molding and then subjecting the outside of a pair of the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B thus preformed to cutting by an NC machine tool. The parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed into a length which prevents the parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from interrupting continuity of a portion or region inside a portion or region opposite to blades <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of an impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided at the central portion of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> extend continuously in the longitudinal direction of the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> without being interrupted by the parting slits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the axial fan unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that includes seven blades <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having a revolving shaft (not shown) fixedly mounted thereon with the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, for rotating the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and three webs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C. In this embodiment, the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the three webs <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C are integrally formed of a material that mainly consists of a synthetic resin material by molding. Since the structure inside the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is described in detail in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 83873/1998, its description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises an opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> arranged opposite to the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a gap, a pair of casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B that extend from opposed edges of the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> toward the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is formed to be circular, piercing the central portion of the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are disposed inside the opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The axial fan unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is so constructed that air is discharged in one axial direction of the revolving shaft of the motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or toward the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A pair of the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B are disposed so as to extend in parallel with the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, engaging sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be engaged with engaged sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed in the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B are provided at both ends of the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B, respectively and these engaging sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the engaged sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprise casing mounting means for mounting the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The cross sections of the engaging sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B are formed to be shaped like hooks, and the cross sections of the engaging sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B are formed to be convex, thereby allowing engagement with the hook-like engaging sections. The engaging sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are arranged to be located inside the engaged sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby being engaged with the engaged sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, by pushing the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B by fingers so that they approach to each other, engagement of the engaging sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the engaged sections <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described before, since a pair of the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B extend to be parallel to the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, when the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is combined with the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a pair of the openings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B are formed at both sides of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> defined in the longitudinal direction of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and at both sides of the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> where a pair of the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B are not located. With this arrangement, air discharged from the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> mainly flows in two opposing directions through a gap G between the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and through intervals between the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for discharge from the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through a pair of the openings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B. If the gap G is formed between the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as in this embodiment, the air discharged from the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> passes through the gap G and passes through all the intervals between the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The cooling effect of the electronic component MPU can be thereby enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has substantially a rectangular board shape and includes in two directions described before where the openings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B are located, a pair of wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a pair of pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are integrally provided on the rear side of a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The cross sections of a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are substantially circular, and the pushing force transferring sections protrude toward the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are formed at the central portions of a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween so as to be symmetrical to each other with respect to the opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and two reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are coupled to the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and are formed to be parallel to each other within the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby reinforcing the cylindrical section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This structure is adopted so as to prevent deformation of the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is molded in one piece using a synthetic resin. With this structure, it is so arranged that an extremely thick portion be not formed in the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the cross sectional shape of a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is defined so as to reduce air resistance against air that flows through the gap G. In this embodiment, the outside shape of a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is so defined that the shape of their cross sections becomes substantially circular. This arrangement can prevent the airflow from being severely blocked with the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. If the cross sectional shape of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed to be substantially circular as in this embodiment in particular, air resistance can be reduced, and the mechanical strength of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be increased. Accordingly, as will be described below, when a pushing force is applied to a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> will not be destructed by the force, so that transfer of the applied pushing force to the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be ensured. The size or diameter of a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> should be defined so that the airflow within the gap G is not extremely obstructed or the cooling efficiency of the heat sink is not greatly reduced, and the force applied to the electronic component MPU is distributed evenly through the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby ensuring satisfactorily intimate contact between the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the electronic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the surfaces of a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, four upright members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are integrally provided in the direction away from the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. These upright members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> constitute an engaging section for preventing mounting tools <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (to be described below) from coming off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The mounting tools <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> indicated by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are so constructed that, when mounting the electronic component cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on a circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, they apply a pushing force to a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby pushing the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>against the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The structure of the mounting tools <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> differs depending on the design of the mounting tool manufacturer, and it is not limited to the illustrated shape. A horizontal bar <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the mounting tools <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> applies to a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the pushing force that pushes a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>against the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or pushes the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> against the electronic component MPU. This pushing force is transferred to the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B and the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B coupled by the casing mounting means, a pair of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the mounting tools <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> apply a pushing force to a pair of the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the opposite wall so as to push the wall sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>against the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the applied pushing force is transferred to the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as well as through the casing side walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>B and the heat sink side walls <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. Then, the pushing force is applied to the electronic component MPU through the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the pushing force is distributed for transfer to the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that the force applied to the electronic component MPU will not become locally and extremely large, or will not be brought into the unbalanced state. In other words, the pushing force is substantially evenly applied to the entire surface of the electronic component MPU. Consequently, the electronic component MPU is brought into well-balanced contact with the base <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the heat sink <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling prevention of local unbalance in heat dissipation of the electronic component MPU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a back view showing a fan unit used in other embodiment of an electronic component cooling apparatus according to the present invention. The electronic cooling apparatus according to the present invention has the same structure as that of the electronic component cooling apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, except for the shape of the members for applying a pushing force. Pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> of the electronic component cooling apparatus in this embodiment have an elongate, streamlined shape so that they parallel airflows indicated by arrows F, which are discharged from the axial fan unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and then flow through the gap G between the leading ends of the radiation fins <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the opposite wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Each of the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical section <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and two reinforcing ribs <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. By using the pushing force transferring sections <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment, air resistance against airflow can be considerably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments described above, each of a pair of the wall sections of the opposite wall is provided with one pushing force transferring section. The pushing force transferring section may be so constructed that it distributes and transfers a pushing force to the heat sink so that it does not greatly obstruct airflow and does not extremely and locally increase a force applied to the electronic component. The number, shape, and dimensions of the pushing force transferring section can be arbitrarily set. A plurality of elongate ribs, for example, can also form the pushing force transferring section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Though the heat sink is formed by extrusion molding in the embodiments described above, it may of course be formed by other molding methods such as casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-mentioned embodiments, the pushing force transferring section distributes a pushing force for transfer to the heat sink, so that the force applied to an electronic component will not increase locally and extremely. For this reason, good contact can be established between the electronic component and the base of the heat sink. Thus, in accordance with the above-mentioned embodiments, local unbalance in heat dissipation of the electronic component will not occur. A reduction in the heat dissipation effect can be thereby prevented. </paragraph>
