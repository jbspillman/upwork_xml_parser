<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tray assemblies are known in the prior art for maintaining multiple rechargeable battery cells (e.g., sealed vent-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) cells) in horizontal positions for motive-power applications. Motive-power applications include providing power, in rechargeable form, to Class 1 to Class 3 trucks, which include various automated guided vehicles (e.g., Class 1 and 2 trucks include electric rider trucks and electric narrow aisle trucks; Class 3 includes electric hand trucks (&ldquo;pallet trucks&rdquo;)). It has been found that by maintaining the battery cells in horizontal positions several benefits can be obtained including, but not limited to, maximizing acid wicking and minimizing plate stratification of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,123 to Beckley, which issued Aug. 15, 1995, discloses a cell tray configured to house six lead-acid cells. The Beckley tray includes a cell enclosure area which is divided into at least three compartments by shelf members which are rigidly attached to the side walls of the cell enclosure area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With reference to U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,559 to Vutetakis et al., which issued Dec. 19, 2000, a tray assembly for holding battery cells in horizontal positions for motive-power applications is shown therein where battery cells are stacked one atop another, with a compression plate being located above the stack configured to apply compressive force downwardly on the entire stack to hold the cells in place. Because the compression plate needs to provide clamping force for all of the cells, the housing is not sub-divided into compartments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although designs are known in the prior art for trays formed to maintain battery cells in horizontal positions for motive-power applications, there is a continuous need to provide simpler and easier-to-manufacture tray designs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To overcome the deficiencies of the prior art, the subject invention provides a tray assembly for use in forming a sealed lead-acid battery system which houses multiple battery cells in horizontal positions for motive-power applications. In one aspect of the subject invention, the battery system includes a plurality of sealed lead-acid battery cells, and a housing having a plurality of walls which define an interior for accommodating the battery cells. At least one tray insert bears against a base of the housing which partitions the interior into at least two compartments for accommodating the battery cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More particularly, in a first embodiment of the first aspect of the subject invention, a box-shaped housing is provided along with at least one inverted U-shaped partition. The partition is dimensioned to slide into the housing with its downwardly depending legs bearing against the base of the housing and being in general face-to-face, or near face-to-face, contact with the side walls of the housing. When disposed within the housing, battery cells may be disposed below the cross member of the partition, as well as atop the cross member of the partition. To facilitate multiple compartments being defined within the enclosure, the partitions are formed to be stackable. As a further variation of the first embodiment, locking tabs may project from the ends of legs of the partitions, which are formed to register with corresponding locking holes located in the base of the housing and/or in a lower-stacked partition. The tabs and holes register with the partitions being fully slid into the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a second, and most preferred, embodiment, a pre-assembled partition of at least one vertical member and one horizontal member is slid into the housing to define multiple compartments therein. Whereas, with a third embodiment of the invention, tubular partitions are provided which are formed to slide into, and stack within, the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the subject invention, a sealed lead-acid battery system for motive-power applications may be provided which utilizes at least one spacer partially disposed between two battery cells to cause separation thereof. More particularly, in a fourth embodiment of the invention, T-shaped spacers may be provided to support edges of stacked battery cells. With this arrangement, portions of the spacers are urged between the cells and the side walls of the housing, with the main branches of the spacers being interposed between adjacent stacked cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With all four embodiments of the subject invention, the tray inserts (i.e., partitions) and the spacers are removable and need not be rigidly fixed to the housing. Therefore, assembly of the subject invention is relatively quick and simple as compared to the prior art. The prior art requires either rigid mounting of the tray inserts or use of a compression plate. If some rigidity is required (e.g., to minimize vibration noise), the tray insert may be fixed to portions of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other features of the invention will be better understood through a study of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of various embodiments of the subject invention. With respect to all of the embodiments, a tray assembly for holding battery cells in horizontal positions for motive-power applications is described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a first embodiment of the subject invention is shown. In particular, a tray assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided having a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with multiple compartments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defined therein for accommodating battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in horizontal positions. The housing includes a base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, side walls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided which are formed to slide into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and partially define the compartments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Each of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed with an inverted U-shape having a transverse cross member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with downwardly depending legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are spaced apart approximately the same as the internal width of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., the spacing between the side walls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). Thus, upon sliding the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be in face-to-face, or near face-to-face, contact with the side walls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With use of multiple partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are stacked vertically, with the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of an upper-stacked partition <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being supported by the cross member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a lower-stacked partition <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereas, the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the lowest-stacked partition <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will bear against the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As can be readily appreciated, the specific dimensioning of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a direct finction of the volume of the cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be stored therein (e.g., the volume of six of the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). Likewise, the specific dimensioning of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is dictated by the volume of the compartments <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (e.g., each compartment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to accommodate two vertically-stacked battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, loading applied to any of the cross members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be transmitted to the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (and intervening partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> depending on the stacked arrangement). As such, loading of upper-stacked battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be primarily, and directly, transmitted to the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In that manner, loading of a large stack of the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on lower-stacked battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As a further variation, locking tabs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be formed to extend from the ends of the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which are formed to register with locking holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed at the junctures of the cross members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the legs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The locking tabs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sized and located to register with the locking holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> when stacking one of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> atop another. Additionally, locking holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed in the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The interengagement of the locking tabs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the locking holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> restricts movement of the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that the locking tabs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the locking holes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> be in registration with the partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being fully slid into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With the tray assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one stack of the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be accommodated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the tray assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be formed to accommodate two stacks of the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or three stacks of the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that little free space about the battery cells <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> be provided within the tray assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Other numbers of stacks, and partitions, are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A second, and most preferred, embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, wherein a tray assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed with the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a pre-assembled partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> slidably disposed therein. The partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> divides the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> into multiple compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, each of the compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to receive one or more of the battery cells and/or one or more vertical stacks of the battery cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is formed with at least one horizontal member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and one vertical member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one variation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> intersect at locations spaced away from respective longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> of the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be located to intersect at the longitudinal edge(s) <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. In either respect, the vertical member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> bears against a base of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are assembled together using any technique known to those skilled in the art. Once assembled, the entire partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is slid into the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. To provide stability to the partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the edge dimensions (at the longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>) of the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be formed generally to the interior dimensions of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, so as to be in bearing, or in near bearing, engagement therewith without excessive play. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be formed and arranged to define one or more open compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>B which extend the height of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The number and configuration of the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be varied to define the size and quantity of the compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. For example, two of the horizontal members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may intersect the vertical member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, or vice versa, to define six of the compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>; or, two of the horizontal members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may intersect two of the vertical members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to define nine of the compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Any loading applied to the partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (e.g., by stacking battery cells on portions of the horizontal member(s) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in one or more of the compartments <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) will be primarily transmitted to the base of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the vertical member(s) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As a further variation, a back plate <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the rear of the members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to provide additional stability to the partition <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The back plate <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be bolted, or rigidly fixed in other manners, to the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (e.g., to a back plate of the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> discussed below) for further stability and to minimize vibration noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> relate to a third embodiment of the subject invention wherein a tray assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is provided having a housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> with multiple tubular partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> disposed therein. Each of the tubular partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> defines a compartment <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> for receiving one or more of the battery cells and/or one or more vertical stacks of the battery cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each of the partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is tubular so as to have an uninterrupted form which extends about the compartment <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> have rectangular profiles with generally parallel top and bottom <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and with a pair of generally parallel side walls <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be formed from seamless stock or from one or more sheets bent and welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As with the previous embodiments, it is preferred that the side walls <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> be dimensioned to come into general face, or near face, contact with the housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to be supported thereby. The dimensioning of the housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, as well as the partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, are dictated by the number of battery cells to be accommodated and/or the number of stacks to be accommodated. The partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be stacked with the lowest-most partition <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> bearing against a base of the housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and upper-stacked partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> being supported by adjacent partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Loading applied to the tops <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (e.g., from the weight of upper-stacked battery cells) will be primarily transmitted to a base of the housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through the bottoms <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (and any intervening partitions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a fourth embodiment of the subject invention is shown wherein a tray assembly <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is provided. The tray assembly <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be formed as a single, stand-alone unit, or formed from smaller stacked tray assemblies <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>B. For illustrative purposes, reference will be made to the tray assembly <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>B. It is to be understood that the tray assembly <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>A is similarly structured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The tray assembly <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>B includes a housing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> having a base <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, side walls <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> formed to define a single compartment <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The compartment <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is not partitioned into smaller compartments as with the other embodiments of the subject invention. Rather, battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are held in a spaced apart relationship within the compartment <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by elongated spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, each of the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is cross-sectionally formed with a T-shape, having a cross piece <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> formed to define a space between the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and a main branch <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> formed to be interposed between stacked battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> to define spaces therebetween. Preferably, two of the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are spaced-apart and inwardly directed to cooperatively separate a pair of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that the housing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> be formed to tightly accommodate a stack of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> being spaced apart by the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The edge support provided by the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is advantageously provided to the side walls of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> which are the strongest portions of the jars of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. With the weight of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> being concentrated on the side walls of the jars, direct pressure on the plates of the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is minimized or altogether eliminated. Nevertheless, it can be appreciated that since the battery cells <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are not fully supported by partitions, but rather have edge support from the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the height of the stack is preferably limited because of the limited edge support. It is desirable to avoid excessively high loading on the battery cells due to an excessive number of cells being stacked. Unlike the previous embodiments, no tray insert is provided in this embodiment which directly transmits load to the base of the housing from upper stacked cells. It is therefore preferred that, as described above, the stack be separated between the two tray assemblies <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>B and other tray assemblies, as required. As an alternative, if loading is not a concern, a single tray assembly can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With respect to all of the embodiments discussed above, the tray inserts (partitions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>) and the spacers <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are slidably disposed within the associated housing, and not necessarily rigidly fixed thereto. Advantageously, the slidable mounting not only eases manufacturing of the tray assemblies, but also permits easy removal of battery cells and re-configuration of the tray assemblies, if desired, so as to accommodate different size and/or number of battery cells. If some rigidity is required (e.g., to minimize vibration noise), the tray inserts may be fixed to portions of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The tray inserts, spacers, and housings are also formed of any suitable material (e.g., metal) which is acceptable for use in motive-power applications, particularly to satisfy explosion-proof and spark-proof requirements such as those set forth by the Underwriters Laboratories (UL-583). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With further reference to all of the embodiments discussed above, a front cover FC may be mounted to housing H (housing H is equivalent to the housings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In addition, a back cover BC may be provided so that the housing H can include a full enclosure with an opening for receiving the battery cells&mdash;that opening being covered by the front cover FC. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> tray insert (e.g., tray insert <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) is mounted into the housing H behind the front cover FC. Open compartments (such as open compartment <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>B) may be defined in the housing H by any of the tray inserts such as by leaving a space or spaces between the tray insert and the side wall of the housing H. With any of the compartments (open or otherwise), battery cells can be stacked vertically and/or horizontally (preferably, horizontally). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A battery charger B may also be disposed within the housing H or attached thereto. Preferably, the battery charger B is mounted via panel opening PO into an additional enclosed space located behind the back cover BC of the housing H. With panel P closing the panel opening PO, the battery charger B is filly enclosed. In addition, apertures may be formed in the housing H so as to give access to the battery cells (e.g., apertures A in the front cover FC to give access to the battery terminals). The battery charger B may be mounted into an enclosed space above the tray insert and battery cells (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). The battery cells may be connected in series or in parallel and cables are electrically connected to the battery cells suitable for connecting to a motive device requiring power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The entire housing H is mountable to a motive-powered vehicle to supply power thereto. With reference to U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,123, particularly FIGS. 11-13 and the associated description thereof, the housing H is mountable to Class 1-3 vehicles. The entire disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,123 is incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Various changes and modifications can be made to the present invention. It is intended that all such changes and modifications come within the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
