<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a method and hardware arrangement which can be used to provide secure and efficient backup copying of a file on a terminal (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) operating in a data communication network (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), assisted by a server (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) connected with the data communication network. The invention also relates to software applications for implementing the method. A backup copy (electronic data file) according to the invention is created in a non-trusted device (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) from which it can be once restored to a trusted device (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) by means of a server (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The server connected with the data communication network stores only the identification information for the trusted terminal (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and for the backed-up file. That information is removed from the server&apos;s memory as soon as a permission has been given to restore the backup copy. This prevents unauthorized duplication of the backed-up file. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for creating an electronic data file from information stored in the memory of a first device operating in a data communication system so that said electronic data file is created in a second device. The invention also relates to a method for restoring an existing electronic data file to a first device operating in a data communication network from a second device. The invention further relates to a hardware arrangement applying the methods according to the invention. The invention further relates to a terminal of a data communication network applying the methods. In addition, the invention relates to software applications residing on a server connected with a data communication network and on a terminal of a data communication network, which software applications employ a method according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Terminals of communication systems are becoming more and more versatile. Hereinafter, the term communication system refers to various radio networks, cellular telephone networks, wire networks or different point-to-point arrangements, for example. In addition to the original speech communication and slow data transfer modern terminals can provide a very wide range of services. For instance, terminals may be used for paying for various purchases. The cost of a purchase may be debited in the phone bill, or electronic money may be stored on a terminal to pay for the purchases. Such an electronic purse is debited by an amount corresponding to the purchase by means of a device at the seller&apos;s disposal, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Counterfeiting money is always a crime, and attempts to falsify funds stored in an electronic form in a device can be considered equally criminal. Such a counterfeit attempt may involve e.g. a situation in which the user of a terminal tries to copy electronic credit to another device from which the equivalent sum of money could then be re-used for a number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Text, pictures, logos, tickets, music and video clips, for example, can be downloaded to a terminal from a variety of sources against payment. The pecuniary value of such data files stored in digital form may be considerable. Consequentially, dishonest parties may be tempted to illegally copy such data files from a device to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Regardless of how the terminal is used, the owner of the terminal may want to change it. In that case the various electronic data files in the original terminal also have to be transferred to the new terminal. For data files that have no pecuniary value, such a transfer is easily accomplished using a personal computer, for example. Data to be transferred are simply saved into the memory of the computer and then transferred back into the memory of the new device. The problem lies with data files that, for some reason or another, cannot be altered or copied without a special permission. Transfer of such data to an external device, the operation of which cannot be controlled in any way, is usually prevented by means of arrangements included in the hardware or software of the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One possible solution to the above-mentioned security problem is that the data are not saved in the memory of the terminal but the terminal always receives the data from a server of a data communication system via an online service. This server is able to authenticate the terminals contacting it. The server also knows, on the basis of information stored in its memory, which data files a particular terminal is allowed to use. A terminal may be debited separately for each time it uses the data. Such a method of organization of the sales of data files is secure from the data supplier&apos;s standpoint, but its speed is insufficient considering the data rates currently applied e.g. in cellular networks. For example, the transfer of a 64-MB data file in a cellular network would take about three hours, which is not acceptable for the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is also possible that a copy of an electronic data file bought on the terminal is stored in a server in the communication system. Such a copy could then be used to restore data files of a given terminal after an error situation. The copies may be quite large so that transferring them back and forth in the communication system would place a great load on the system. If there occurs an error in the creation or transfer of the copy, the whole data file may be lost or become unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A third possible way to solve the security problem mentioned above is such that the copying of certain electronic data files purchased from outside the terminal is made very difficult by means of either software controlling the operation of the terminal or a smart card attached to the terminal. This way, unauthorized copying of electronic data files can at least be made more difficult, but an unauthorized copying attempt (made on purpose or involuntarily) could result in an error on the terminal that would destroy all electronic data files for good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide a method and hardware arrangement that places only a small load on a data communication system and by means of which electronic data files stored in the memory of a terminal of a data communication system can be stored in a second device so that the electronic data files cannot be illegally restored in usable form from said second device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The objects of the invention are achieved by a method and hardware arrangement in which certain data files stored in a first device are stored, with the assistance of a backup service according to the invention, in a second device from which an electronic data file can be only once restored under the control of the backup service either to the original device that used the electronic data file or, alternatively, to some other device specified by the owner of the electronic data file. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> means for restoring the electronic data file in a usable form to the memory of the trusted terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Some advantageous embodiments of the invention are specified in the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The basic idea of the invention is as follows: When an electronic data file is to be created from information in the memory of a terminal of a data communication system, the terminal will contact a backup service associated with the data communication system, which backup service will identify the owner of the electronic data file and/or the terminal used by the owner and the data to be saved. Hereinafter, the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; refers to both the owner/user of the device and the terminal used by the owner/user. The backup service saves the information in question into its memory and advantageously gives the terminal an instruction to decrypt or alter the information in question in a manner specified by or known to the backup service. When an electronic data file according to the invention is created, it is at the same time converted such that it cannot be used by the terminal. Having created the electronic data file according to the invention the terminal transfers it into the memory of a second device. When an existing electronic data file is to be restored to the terminal, either to the original one or some other terminal, the owner of the data file requesting a restore contacts the backup service and indicates which electronic data file it wants to restore into its memory in the original form. If the owner is successfully authenticated, the backup service sends to the terminal the information with which the electronic data file can be restored in usable form. When the restoring instructions have been successfully sent, the backup service deletes the information concerning the electronic data file in question. The terminal can now convert the electronic data file so that it can be used and save it into its memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the invention is that the electronic data file in its entirety need not at any point be transferred in the data communication system serving the terminal, thus saving the resources of the data communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the invention is that from the user&apos;s point of view, saving and restoring the data can be accomplished more quickly than if all of the data should be transferred to the backup service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the invention is that an electronic data file on a terminal can be copied to any other device in such a way that the data of a copy cannot, however, be illegally transferred to another device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A yet further advantage of the invention is that memory capacity need not be allocated in the data communication system for storing the electronic data files of terminals of the data communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A still further advantage of the invention is that the user of a terminal can freely be given a chance to transfer an electronic data file from a terminal to another.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows as an example the components belonging to the arrangement according to the invention. The arrangement comprises a data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, advantageously a radio network based on wireless transmission of messages. Such a radio network advantageously comprises a plurality of separate cells and associated hardware which together constitute an entity that hereinafter is called a service network. Such service networks are e.g. wireless local area networks and various cellular telephone networks. At least one server is associated with the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the invention, which server assists terminals <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, advantageously mobile terminals, connected to the data communication system, in creating the required electronic data files and in controlling the restoration of a data file. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> this server/function is represented by a backup service, reference <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, connected, advantageously through a fixed connection <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, to a device belonging to the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Communication in the data communication system includes both the normal exchange of messages between the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and messages transferred during the creation/restoration of electronic data files according to the invention. The messages transferred in the creation and restoration of electronic data files according to the invention are advantageously always encrypted between the terminal and backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a technique according to the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Operating in a data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is a mobile terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which communicates with the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advantageously through a wireless connection <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This device is hereinafter called the first device. The first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been identified as a trusted device by a service provider operating in the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (e.g. trusted device having a certificate given and electronically signed by a third party), whereby a service/product from the service provider has been stored in the device against payment, for example. For the terminal to be classified as a trusted device, part of its memory has to be defined as secure memory that can be used only in processes meeting certain specified criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is advantageously a terminal of a cellular network. Apart from the aforementioned demand concerning the protected memory the operation according to the invention does not place any other special demands on the mechanical or electrical construction of the terminal. Thus the terminal may be almost a conventional cellular terminal the control software of which additionally includes a software application that enables the creation and restoration of an electronic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention for creating and restoring an electronic data file requires a separate second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into which the electronic data file is saved in altered form. Unlike the first device, this second device need not necessarily be identified as a trusted device by the service provider operating in the data communication system. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a personal computer PC. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any device having enough memory capacity to create an electronic data file according to the invention can be used as the second device according to the invention. A connection <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be established from the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The connection may be a fixed connection via a cable, an infrared link or a connection implemented using a radio link, such as a Bluetooth connection, for instance. Furthermore, the second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be connected with the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a similar link as the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment of the invention the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> always permits the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to create an electronic data file. The backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> saves into its memory the identification information concerning the owner (trusted terminal) of the data file and advantageously some other information concerning the electronic data file itself. This other information advantageously comprises information about how the electronic data file has been modified and how it can be restored. The electronic data file itself is not transferred to the memory of the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> associated with the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This saves the transmission resources of the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> considerably. Having saved the above-mentioned identifying information for the electronic data file into its memory the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> permits the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to create an electronic data file in the second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This electronic data file is, however, created advantageously modified in a manner controlled/specified by the backup service. This way, the electronic data file cannot be opened without a restore instruction/permission from the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the owner wants to restore the information in the electronic data file back into the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, in this advantageous embodiment the trusted first device asks the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for a permission to do so. The backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> checks the authenticity of the identification information of the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and if the information is valid, it sends to the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the information needed for restoring the electronic data file. Having received an indication of a successful restoration the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> erases from its memory all identification information concerning the electronic data file in question. This way, an electronic data file can only be used once to restore files to a trusted device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This trusted device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be the first device in which the electronic data file was originally created or some other device identified as a trusted device. If an electronic data file according to the invention is created in a second trusted device, it can be restored direct to this second trusted device which means in practice that it is possible to carry out a controlled data transfer from one trusted device to another trusted device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention a first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> creates on its own initiative an electronic data file from information in a second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using a method known to and/or selected by the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> without asking for a permission from the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Having created the electronic data file the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and informs the latter about the electronic data file and the method used to create it. In this embodiment the file is restored advantageously as follows. A trusted device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> requesting for file restoration sends to the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a restore request identifying the file to be restored. If the backup service recognizes the first device requesting for restoration, it sends a message to the latter indicating the method with which the restoration can be successfully executed. Having received an acknowledgment of a successful file restoration the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> erases from its memory the information concerning the electronic data file in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows as an example a flow diagram illustrating how an electronic data file is created using a method according to a first advantageous embodiment of the invention. In step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> the user of a trusted first device wants to create an electronic data file from at least one piece of information stored in electronic form in his terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This piece of information may be e.g. copyrighted material such as an audio recording or a literary work. If electronically usable funds have been saved in the first device, the user of the first device can transfer these funds to a temporary non-trusted second device using an electronic data file according to the invention. In the next step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the trusted first device MU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts a backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This contact, as well as the identification of the trusted first device, can be advantageously executed using a WAP WTLS level 3 protocol (WAP WTLS: Wireless Application Protocol, Wireless Transport Layer Security). A terminal operating in accordance with the protocol sends its messages encrypted, it can identify the server at the other end of the connection, and it sends the information identifying the terminal to the receiving server for an identification to be carried out at the server end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> makes a decision about whether the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which requests for service, has been identified or not. If the identification is accepted, the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> sends, if necessary, the data of the electronic data file proper in step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. These data advantageously include a description of the type of information for which the electronic data file is to be created. In step <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> the backup service saves into its memory the above-mentioned data for the first device which wants to create the electronic copy and for the information to be copied. If in step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> the first device contacting the service is not identified as a trusted device, the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prevents the creation of the electronic data file by shutting down the connection between itself and the device that contacted it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sends to the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> instructions on how it should process the information to be copied in conjunction with the electronic data file to be created. These instructions advantageously include a cipher key which the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should use in making the electronic data file. Also during step <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> executes other possible actions in accordance with the instructions obtained from the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These actions may include the encryption of all of the data using the cipher key sent to the trusted first device or modifications in the contents of the electronic data file according to the instructions from the backup service in order to prevent the use of the data file. Such modifications may involve e.g. the removal of the electronic signature from the electronic data file created, whereby the electronic data file becomes extremely difficult to use. The removed part of the electronic data file is advantageously transferred into the memory of the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After these measures the data is in such a form that it is unusable as such. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> the trusted first device saves the encrypted/processed electronic data file into a second, non-trusted device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The saved data are in the memory of the device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in such a form that they cannot be utilized in the device or in any other device to which they could be transferred from the device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The process thus comes to step <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at which the electronic data file resides in the memory of the non-trusted device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows as an example a flow diagram illustrating the main phases of the creation of an electronic data file according to a second embodiment of the invention. The procedure starts at step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> after which in step <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> creates an electronic data file in a second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using a known technique. In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts a backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> associated with the data communication system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> finds in step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> that the request for creating an electronic data file comes from a known trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it receives in step <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> the identification information of the device and other information concerning the type of the data file provided by the terminal. In step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> the backup service saves the received data into its memory. The procedure ends at step <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> by which the electronic data file has been created. If for a reason or another the contacting terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not identified in step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shuts down the communication connection, thus preventing the creation of the data file according to the invention, step <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> An electronic data file created using the procedure according to the second embodiment of the invention can be restored using the restore procedure according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows as an example a flow diagram of how a desired piece of information is restored to a trusted device from an existing electronic data file. This trusted device may be the same device from which the data originally came from. However, for a reason or another, the user may change devices, so advantageously the data can also be restored into another trusted device. Naturally the method according to the invention can be used to transfer the right of use of a file to some other person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The restore process starts from step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> wants to restore an electronic data file into its memory from a second device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contacts a backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> advantageously using a WAP WTLS level 3 protocol. This establishment of connection advantageously also includes the identification of the contacting device shown in step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. If the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> does not recognize the contacting device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it prevents the restoration of the electronic data file by shutting down the connection between itself and the first device, bringing the process to step <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> advantageously sends a restore request for an electronic data file to the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This restore request advantageously includes information specifying the electronic data file to be restored. Advantageously the restore request also includes some data about the electronic data file on the basis of which the backup service can verify that the electronic data file is downloaded back into the first device in an encrypted form. In step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> compares the data in the restore request against data in its memory concerning the electronic data file. If the data do not match, the process is not continued but the connection with the first device is shut down, bringing the process again to step <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If the identifying information of the electronic data file is acceptable in step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> permits in step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> the restoration of the data in the electronic data file. This restore permit given to the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> advantageously also includes the information/cipher key by means of which the electronic data file transferred from the memory of a non-trusted device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be converted back into usable form. At this stage, the connection between the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has to be such (e.g. WAP WTLS level 3) that the information/cipher key used in the restoration of the electronic data file is saved into the memory of the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the secure part of the memory the contents of which normally cannot be read. This information/cipher key can be used only this one time to restore the information contained in the electronic data file. After a successful restoration the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> erases the cipher key from its memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> erases from its memory the information related to the restoration of the electronic data file. However, this is only done after it has been verified that the restoration of the file was successful at the terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This erasure of information ensures that only one restoration can be performed for one electronic data file according to the invention, for the memory of the backup service <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> no longer holds information about how a copy of the electronic data file possibly still residing in the memory of the non-trusted device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could be opened or converted usable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The restore process ends at step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in which the trusted first device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> re-saves the opened electronic data file into its memory in a usable form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention can be applied in any existing cellular network. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a simplified block diagram of a cellular network terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> applying the procedure according to the invention. The user interface of the terminal advantageously comprises a display <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> and keyboard <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also comprises an antenna <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to receive RF signals from base stations of the cellular network. A received RF signal is conducted by a switch <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to a RF receiver <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> where the signal is amplified and converted digital. The signal is then detected and demodulated as well decrypted and deinterleaved. Signal processing is then performed in block <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. The received data may be saved as such into the terminal&apos;s memory <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> or alternatively the processed data are transferred after signal processing to an external device. A control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> controls the aforementioned receiving functions in accordance with a program stored in the unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Transmission from the terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is accomplished e.g. as follows. Controlled by the control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, block <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> performs possible signal processing on the data. Block <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> performs interleaving and encryption on the processed signal to be transmitted, bursts are generated from the data which are modulated and then amplified into a RF signal to be transmitted. The RF signal to be transmitted is conducted to the antenna <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> via switch <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Also the aforementioned processing and transmission functions are controlled by the control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. The terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> uses the transmission block <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> to transmit the messages to the base stations in the cellular network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> From the invention&apos;s standpoint, essential components in the cellular terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are the terminal&apos;s memory <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, part of which is allocated for saving the data needed in the operation according to the invention, and the control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> which processes the information contained in the messages and normally controls the operation of the terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In addition, at least part of the memory <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> in the cellular terminal <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has to be defined as secure memory the contents of which can only be used during operation according to the invention. Moreover, in association with the control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> there is executed a software application according to the invention which in conjunction with the creation and restoration of an electronic data file controls the operation of the control unit <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method according to the invention requires that in the cellular network there is a resource which is capable of executing the tasks of the backup service according to the invention. Advantageously this functionality can be provided by one or more servers connected with the cellular network. Of course the backup service according to the invention may also be realized as a sub-function of some already existing server in the network. In that case, software has to be installed in that server, implementing the steps of the method according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Embodiments according to the invention were described above. The invention is not limited to those embodiments. For example, the communication between a trusted device and backup service may be realized using some other protocol than the exemplary protocol used in the embodiments described above. In addition, the inventional idea can be applied in numerous ways within the scope defined by the claims attached hereto. </paragraph>
