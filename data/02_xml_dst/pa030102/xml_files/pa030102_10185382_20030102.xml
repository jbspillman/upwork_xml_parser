<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a variable valve lift system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a variable valve lift system in which a valve lift is varied in two stages through changes in valve lift and cam duration by selectively rigidly engaging a tappet shim. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An engine is typically structured such that cams mounted on a camshaft open and close intake and exhaust valves by rotation of the camshaft. In some modem engines, a variable valve control system is used in which valve timing and the amount of lift of the valves are controlled to improve performance and reduce fuel consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a conventional variable valve lift system for controlling the degree of valve lift includes a tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that receives operational force from cam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for transmitting an operational force from the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Supports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are mounted to four points on the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and supports <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are mounted to four points on the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The four points of the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> oppose the four points of the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. An elastic member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is interposed between each opposing pair of supports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to provide a biasing force to the supports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the direction of the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a biasing force to the supports <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the direction of the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are mounted in hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. An elastic member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is interposed between the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> move by interaction with the elastic member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and with oil in the hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Oil holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> lead into the hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to enable the supply of oil thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the variable valve lift system structured as in the above, if oil is not supplied through the oil holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are positioned within the hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively, as a result of receiving a biasing force of the elastic member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, a state in which the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not upwardly supported is maintained. Hence, the operational force of the cam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, transmitted to the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is absorbed by the elastic members <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> positioned between the supports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> such that the valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is operated through the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. With such operation, the amount of lift of the valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> cannot be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, if oil (a) is supplied through the oil holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> overcome the biasing force of the elastic member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> such that the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are forced in a direction toward each other to be positioned at the outside edge of the hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, respectively. As a result, the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is upwardly supported, that is, the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> cannot be downwardly displaced into the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in this state. Hence, the operational force of the cam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, transmitted through the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, operates the valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after it is transmitted by the supports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The amount of lift of the valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is increased as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the above variable lift system, since the two stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> support the tappet shim <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> during application of a load by a cam lobe, the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> experience wear. Further, the elastic member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, interposed between the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, does not precisely return the stoppers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when oil is exhausted from the hydraulic chambers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a variable valve lift system in which valve lift is varied in two stages through changes in valve lift and cam duration by selectively rigidly engaging a tappet shim, and in which the durability of the support and the return of the stopper are improved. In a preferred embodiment, a tappet shim receives an operational force from the cam. A body transmits an operational force of the tappet shim to the valve. First and second supports, the first supports being provided on a surface of the tappet shim opposing the body and the second supports being provided on a surface of the body opposing the tappet shim, are supported by elastic members. First and second stoppers, mounted respectively in first and second hydraulic pressure chambers, formed on opposite sides of the body, are provided with an elastic member interposed between the first stopper and the body and an elastic member interposed between the second stopper and the body. The first and second stoppers selectively rigidly support the tappet shim in a second lift stage. A third stopper is mounted in a third hydraulic pressure chamber, which is formed in the body at a location opposing the tappet shim, and an elastic member is interposed between the third stopper and the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the elastic members positioned in the first, second, and third hydraulic pressure chambers provide a biasing, pulling force to create resistance to hydraulic pressure acting on the first, second, and third stoppers. It is also preferable that the third stopper be mounted at substantially a center portion of the body to support the tappet shim in a state that is balanced during operation under the lobe load of the cam. It is further preferable that the third stopper is further configured to provide a higher position than the first and second stoppers during operation such that the third stopper supports the tappet shim at a high lift of the valve when oil is supplied to the third hydraulic pressure chamber.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience and reference only, and will not be limiting. The words &lsquo;upper&rsquo;, &lsquo;lower&rsquo;, &lsquo;up&rsquo;, &lsquo;down&rsquo;, etc., designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made, without limiting the orientation of the invention in actual practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The variable valve lift system includes a tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, upper and lower supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and a third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is provided in close contact with a rotating cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> such that the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> receives the lobe load of the cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is configured to undergo up and down motion in accordance with the rotation of the cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> cooperates with an upper portion of a valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to transmit an operational force from the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The upper supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are mounted to a surface of the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> opposing the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and the lower supports <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are mounted to a surface of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> opposing the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. An elastic member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is interposed between each opposing pair of upper and lower supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to provide a biasing force to the upper supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a direction of the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a biasing force to the lower supports <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a direction of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, with particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, are mounted in first and second hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are formed on opposite sides of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are respectively interposed between the first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and an opposing wall of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> within the respective first and second hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Oil holes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are formed in the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> leading into the first and second hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are structured to selectively rigidly support the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is supported by the elastic members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the upper and lower supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> apply a biasing force (i.e., a pulling force) in a direction that resists pressure of oil supplied through the oil holes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. When hydraulic pressure is not acting in the first and second hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are positioned within the first and second hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, respectively, by the biasing force of the elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, respectively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is mounted in a third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which is formed in the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at a location opposing the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. An elastic member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is interposed between the third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and an opposing wall of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> within the third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. An oil hole <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed through the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, also leading into the third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) applies a biasing force in a direction that resists pressure of oil supplied through the oil hole <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> into the third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. That is, the biasing force of the elastic member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is in a direction to pull the third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> into the third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is mounted substantially in a center portion of the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to support the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in a balanced manner during operation of cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and application of the lobe load. Further, the third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is configured to provide a higher position than the first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> during operation such that the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is supported at high lift of the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> when oil is supplied to the third hydraulic pressure chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Operation of the variable valve lift system of the present invention structured as in the above will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If oil is not supplied through the oil holes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the first, second, and third stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are positioned within the first, second, and third hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, respectively, as a result of the biasing forces of the elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, respectively. As a result, a state in which the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is not upwardly supported is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this state, the operational force of the cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> transmitted to the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is absorbed by the elastic members <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> positioned between the supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> such that the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is operated through the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. With such operation, the amount of lift of the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is not varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, if oil (a) is supplied through the holes <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the first, second, and third stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> overcome the biasing forces of the elastic members <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, respectively, such that the first, second, and third stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are forced out of the first, second, and third hydraulic pressure chambers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, respectively. As a result, the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is upwardly supported, that is, the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> cannot be downwardly displaced into the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is configured to provide a higher position than the first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> during operation. The third stopper <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> then supports the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> before the first and second stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> such that a higher lift amount for valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the operational force of the cam <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, transmitted to the tappet shim <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, operates the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the body <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> after it is transmitted by the first and second supports <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the first, second, and third stoppers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The amount of lift of the valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is varied as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the variable valve lift system of the present invention structured and operating as in the above, with the provision of the first, second, and third stoppers, and the elastic members supporting the first, second, and third stoppers mounted in the first, second, and third hydraulic pressure chambers, the valve lift is varied in two steps, and the resistance of the supports and return of the stoppers are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, when oil is not supplied to the hydraulic pressure chambers, the valve lift and cam duration (time of force applied to tappet) decrease to a level ideal for low and medium speeds and when idling. Also, this enables lean combustion to minimize emissions before the catalytic converted is warmed up. When oil is supplied to the hydraulic pressure chambers, a high valve lift is realized to improve engine output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail hereinabove, it should be clearly understood that many variations and/or modifications of the basic inventive concepts herein taught which may appear to those skilled in the present art will still fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
