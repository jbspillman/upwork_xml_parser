<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention suppresses to a minimum the degradation of the transmission quality caused by chromatic dispersion characteristic of an optical transmission medium, and the interplay between the chromatic dispersion and non-linear optical effects in dense WDM transport systems. A baseband input data signal is pre-coded in advance by a pre-coding unit, phase modulation is carried out using a pre-coded signal by the optical phase modulating unit, and the phase modulated optical signal is converted to an RZ intensity modulated signal by the optical filter unit that performs phase-shift-keying to amplitude-shift-keying conversion. For example, an optical phase modulating unit generates an encoded DPSK phase modulated signal using a differential phase shirt keying (DPSK) format, and a phase modulated signal is converted to an RZ intensity modulated signal by the optical filter unit disposed downstream of the optical phase modulating unit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical transmitter and an optical transmission system that can minimize the deterioration in the transmission quality due to the chromatic dispersion of an optical transmission medium such as an optical fiber, or due to the interaction between the chromatic dispersion and nonlinear optical effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This application is based on patent application No. 2001-199467 filed in Japan, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An RZ (return-to-zero) optical intensity modulation format used along with phase modulation has been proposed having the object of minimizing the deterioration in the transmission quality due to the chromatic dispersion of an optical transmission medium such as an optical fiber, or due to the interaction between the chromatic dispersion and nonlinear optical effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, a citation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y. Miyamoto et al. &ldquo;Duobinary carrier-suppressed return-to-zero format and its application to 100 GHz-spaced 8&times;43-Gbit/sec DWDM unrepeatered transmission over 163 km&rdquo;, Tech. Digest of OFC 2001, paper Tu U4, 2001, discloses a technology relating to a duobinary carrier-suppressed return-to-zero (DCS-RZ) format that modulates a dual mode beat signal with an optical duobinary code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is a diagram for explaining the conventional structure of an optical transmitter that uses a DCS-RZ format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41, a</cross-reference> direct current bias is applied to the first push-pull type Mach-Zehnder (MZ) optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> so as to realize transmission-null when unmodulated, and the first push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is complementarily driven by an electrical sine wave signal having one-half the frequency of the line rate generated by a half frequency divider <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The intensity and phase of the CW light output from the single longitudinal mode LD <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which is the light source of the carrier frequency f<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, are simultaneously modulated by the MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> using the frequency multiplier function and the phase modulation function of an MZ optical intensity modulator, and a dual mode beat signal having a repetition frequency of B is generated. Here, B is the line rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At the second MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, the dual mode beat signal is modulated with data using an optical duobinary format. The input NRZ (non-return-to-zero) signal is converted to a pre-coded NRZ code by the precoder circuit <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> that is formed by the logic inversion circuit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the exclusive OR circuit <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and the <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> bit delay circuit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and the pre-coded NRZ code is differentially output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The differential pre-coded NRZ code is amplified by the baseband amplifier <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and then converted to a complementary ternary electrical duobinary code by the low pass filter (LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>) having 3 dB bandwidth of B/4. A direct current bias is applied to the second MZ optical modulator <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> so as to realize transmission-null when unmodulated, and the second MZ optical modulator <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> modulates with a complementary ternary electrical duobinary code to generate a DCS-RZ optically modulated code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A through 42F</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference> show an example of the operation of the conventional technology. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</cross-reference> shows the binary NRZ signal input generated by the binary NRZ signal generating unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</cross-reference> shows the NRZ data signal output from the logic inversion circuit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in the case that a binary NRZ signal is input. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42C</cross-reference> shows the positive-phase signal output from the pre-coding circuit <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> in the case that the output NRZ data signal is input, and the logic thereof is inverted each time a space bit is input as the input NRZ signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42D</cross-reference> shows the waveform output from the LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> in the case that the pre-coded signal is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown by reference numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, the logical operation of the LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is identical to that of a circuit block comprising the 1 bit delay circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the analog AND circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Due to the band limiting function of the LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, the complementary ternary electrical duobinary signal shown by the bold solid line is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42E</cross-reference> shows the electrical field waveform of the dual mode beat optical signal modulated by the first MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> when the CW optical signal from the LD <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which is the light source, is input. The electrical field waveform forms an optical pulse train where the repetition frequency is equal to the line rate, and whose optical phase is alternate &pgr; phase flip for each bit. This dual mode beat optical signal is modulated with the ternary electrical duobinary signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>D, and thereby the DCS-RZ code shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42F</cross-reference> is generated. The phase is inverted for each mark bit, and thus an RZ intensity modulated optical data signal is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</cross-reference> shows the optical spectrum of the dual mode beat signal output from the first MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. The optical carrier signal component f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is suppressed, and at the optical frequency fb&plusmn;(B/2) (where B is the line rate), two longitudinal modes having a frequency spacing of B are generated. The two longitudinal modes are modulated with each of the optical duobinary codes by the second MZ optical modulator <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>B, the optical modulated spectrum of the generated DCS-RZ optical signal is comprised of two optical duobinary signal modulated spectrum arranged at optical frequencies f<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&plusmn;B, the carrier component is completely suppressed, and the optical modulation band is narrowed to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Thereby, the tolerance with respect to chromatic dispersion is double that of the conventional RZ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The above format suppresses the impairment of the optical duobinary code due to optical nonlinear effects, and thus RZ encoding can be realized while suppressing the broadening of the optical modulation band. Thus, this is suitable as a modulation format in a dense wavelength division multiplexing transmission system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When considering a wavelength division multiplexing system on a binary RZ intensity modulation code, the optical nonlinear phase shift due to the cross-phase modulation from other channels is strongly depending on the signal pattern, and the interplay between chromatic dispersion and cross-phase modulation (XPM) causes the system performance to deteriorate. In order to mitigate the XPM-induced impairment, T. Miyano et al. propose an RZ-intensity-modulated phase-encoded signal in citation 2, T. Miyano, M. Fukutoku, and K. Hattori, &ldquo;Suppression of degradation induced by SPM/XPG&plus;GVM transmission using a bit-synchronous intensity modulated DPSK signal&rdquo;, Digest of OECC2000, Makuhari, paper 14D3-3, pp. 580-581, 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As described above, in a conventional optical transmitter and optical transmission system using an RZ optical intensity modulated format used with phase modulation, generally, optical modulators are necessary for each intensity modulation, phase encoding, and pulse modulation, and these optical modulators are connected in a multi-stage cascade. Thereby, the insertion loss in the modulating unit increases, and the optical output power of the modulating unit decreases. Thus, there are the problems that the optical signal shot noise increases and the SN ratio of the output of the optical transmitting unit degrades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the case of high speed transmission, the relative phase between an electrical data signal and a clock signal for each of the modulators connected in multi-stage must be precisely controlled, and in order to compensate the drift of the phase due to temperature characteristics and the like, a stable phase control must be carried out. Thereby, the problem of the control circuits and the like becoming complicated is made tangible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the conventional wavelength division multiplexing system, since two or more optical modulators must be installed for each channel, the number of parts increases, in particular in the case that the number of channel increases in the WDM system. This is a drawback because the cost of the optical transmitter and the optical transmission system using them increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At the same time, in the conventional RZ optical transmitter and optical transmission system using a DCS-RZ format, the optical duobinary encoding unit, which carries out the intensity data modulation and phase modulation in data encoding process requires a baseband analog processing circuit (LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>) that generates a ternary opto-electrical signal converted signal depending on the line rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the line rate increases, however, it is difficult to realize the high-speed baseband analog processing in the unit. In order to suppress waveform distortion of the ternary electrical duobinary signal, the waveform distortion due to reflected waves in the rejection band of the LPF <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> must be suppressed. At the same time, in the high frequency band, realizing ideal electrical characteristics is difficult, and in particular, terminating the reflected wave in the rejection band of the filter is difficult. In addition, when realizing the ideal roll-off characteristics of the electrical filter, frequency dependent loss and frequency dispersion of the electrical transmission line and the filters occurs as the line rate increases, and thereby the waveform distortion occurs. Thus, there is the problem that compensation of the waveform becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, the conventional PSK signal that has been modulated using an RZ format can suppress the cross-phase modulation in a wavelength division multiplexing system. However, when considering an increasingly high density of the wavelength division multiplexing system equal to or above 0.4 bits/s/Hz, the optical modulation band spreads four times the line rate, and thus the cross-talk penalty increases. In addition, when considering the high-speed transmission using the conventional technology, it is necessary to increase the operating speed of the baseband signal input into the modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> However, as the line rate increases, generally there is a tendency for the breakdown voltage of the electronic device to decrease, and thus this makes difficult to realize high output operation in a driver for driving a modulator or the like becomes difficult. Furthermore, realization of high-speed operation in the pre-coding circuit as well becomes difficult, and it is necessary to redesign and remanufacture the circuit each time the line rate is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an optical transmitter and an optical transmission system wherein decreasing the loss and increasing the speed of the optical modulator is facilitated by using the RZ optical intensity modulation format along with phase modulation. In addition, the invention measures the increasing speed of the analog signal processing by performing a function in the optical carrier frequency domain, which has been carried out by a conventional baseband analog processing circuit. Furthermore, the invention facilitates realization of an amplifier circuit such as a driver circuit by encoding all the electric signals with a simple binary NRZ format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical transmitter and an optical transmission system that use the RZ optical intensity modulation format along with phase modulation, and that make possible simultaneous PSK-ASK conversion of the wavelength division multiplexed signals by using a periodic optical conversion filter, and make possible the elimination of the synchronization function in the active high-speed signal processing by using a passive optical filter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This summary of the invention does not necessarily describe all necessary features so that the invention may also be a sub-combination of these described features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The optical transmitter of the present invention comprises: a light source; a pre-coding device that receives an NRZ signal; an optical phase modulating device that carries out optical phase modulation and that is driven by either a pre-coded NRZ signal or a differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; and an output terminal, wherein an RZ optical signal in which a plurality of duobinary optical signal components are included in the optical RZ signal spectrum with carrier suppression is output from the output terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, the optical transmitter of the present invention comprises: a light source which is a single mode longitudinal light source; a pre-coding device that generates a differential pre-coded NRZ signal whose logic inverts each time a mark bit is input as an NRZ signal; an optical phase modulating device that modulates the optical phase of a single longitudinal mode optical signal from the light source using the differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; and an optical filter device that converts an optical-phase modulated signal generated by the optical phase modulating device to an RZ optical intensity modulated signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the optical transmitter of the present invention further comprises: a dual mode beat pulse light source that generates two longitudinal mode signals which synchronizes with a data signal and which have the mode spacing between the two longitudinal modes that is an integral multiple of the data line rate, and which is mode-locked with each other; a pre-coding device that carries out code conversion such that an intensity modulated signal output from the optical transmitter has a logic identical to the input NRZ signal; and an optical phase modulating device in which an optical pulse train generated by the dual mode beat pulse light source has undergone optical phase modulation by a pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system of the present invention comprises: an optical transmitter that comprises: a light source; a pre-coding device that receives an NRZ signal; an optical phase modulating device that carries out optical phase modulation and that is driven by either a pre-coded NRZ signal or a differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; and an output terminal, and that outputs an RZ optical signal having the suppressed carrier component from the output terminal as an optical transmission signal; an optical phase-modulation/amplitude modulation converting device that is provided on one of either the optical transmitter or an optical receiver; wherein the optical receiver demodulates and detects the transmitted RZ optical signal as an optical intensity modulated signal, and converts the optical intensity modulated signal to an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In addition, the optical transmission system of the present invention comprises: an optical transmitter that comprises: a pre-coding device that generates a differential pre-coded NRZ signal whose logic inverts each time a mark bit is input as the NRZ signal; an optical phase modulating device that performs optical phase modulation on a signal from either a single longitudinal mode light source or a dual mode beat pulse light source using the differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; and an optical filter device that converts an optical phase modulated signal generated by the optical phase modulating device into an RZ optical intensity modulated signal; an optical transmission medium that transmits the RZ optical intensity modulated signal output by the optical transmitter; and an optical receiver that receives the RZ optical intensity modulated signal output by the optical transmitter via the optical transmission medium, and directly detects the RZ optical intensity modulated signal to convert the RZ optical intensity modulated signal into a baseband electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission system of the present invention comprises: an optical transmitter that is provided with: a pre-coding device that carries out code conversion of the input NRZ signal such that the optical intensity modulated signal output from the optical transmitter has a logic identical to the input NRZ signal; and an optical phase modulating device that performs optical phase modulation on a signal either from a single longitudinal-mode light source or a dual mode beat pulse light source using the differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; an optical transmission medium that transmits a phase modulated data signal with sinusoidal RZ optical intensity modulation that has been output by the optical transmitter; and an optical receiver that receives the RZ optical modulated signal output by the optical transmitter via the optical transmission medium, and after passing through an optical filter device that converts the RZ optical modulated phase-encoded signal to an optical amplitude-encoded signal, directly detects the optical intensity modulated signal to convert to a baseband electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the structure described above, the baseband input data signal is pre-coded in advance by the pre-coding device, phase modulation is carried out by the phase modulating device using the pre-coded signal, and the resultant phase encoded optical signal is converted into an RZ intensity modulated signal that has undergone the phase modulation by the optical filter device. The phase modulating device, for example, generates an encoded DPSK phase modulation signal using differential phase shift keying (DPSK), and converts the phase modulated signal into an RZ intensity signal by the optical filter device disposed downstream of the DPSK optical modulation signal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If an optical periodic filter is used as the optical filter device described above, conversion of modulation format of the wavelength division multiplexed signals can be simultaneously conducted due to the broadband characteristic of the optical filter, and thus an optical filter device for each channel becomes unnecessary. Thereby, the number of parts can be drastically reduced in the high capacity wavelength division multiplexing system having a large number of channels, and thereby the cost of the optical transmitter can be reduced. In addition, by using a passive optical filter that does not require high-speed signals, precise control of the signal phase between modulators becomes unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In particular, by using a Mach-Zehnder optical intensity modulator as the phase modulating device that carries out differential phase shift keying on the single longitudinal mode optical signal using a pre-coded NRZ signal, it is possible to use only binary NRZ signals as the electric signals. Therefore, the baseband signal processing can be easily realized, and the number of optical modulators can be reduced. In addition, the analog processing function conventionally carried out in the baseband can be realized in an optical carrier frequency band using a passive optical filter, and thereby, an ideal wideband analog processing can be realized, and improvement of the reflective characteristics in the filter processing and the broadband transmission characteristics becomes possible for generation of the ultra-high-speed signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In addition, as another embodiment of the optical transmission system of the present invention, an optical filter that carries out phase modulation/RZ intensity modulation conversion is disposed on the receiver side of the optical transmission system, phase encoded signal is used as a transmission code, and an RZ pulse whose intensity has been phase encoded is used. Thereby, transmission impairments due to nonlinear cross talk such as cross-phase modulation in wavelength division multiplexing transmission system can be suppressed, and at the same time the optical modulation band can be reduced in comparison to conventional technology, and attaining higher density wavelength division multiplexing system becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As another embodiment of the optical transmission system of the present invention, the phase modulating device can be structured by n phase modulators connected in series. Thereby, by using a driver for driving a modulator and a pre-coding circuit having a baseband signal processing speed of B&prime;, it is possible to generate a phase modulated optical data signal that has undergone the n time division multiplexed RZ intensity modulation having a line rate of B&equals;n&times;B&prime; or an RZ intensity optical data signal that has undergone phase modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> All of these multiplexed signals are bandwidth-reduced RZ signals, and can form a high-density wavelength division multiplexing system using a simple structure in comparison to conventional technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In addition, as yet another embodiment of the transmitter and the pre-coding device in the optical transmission system according to the present invention, by using a structure comprising n pre-coding circuits having a signal processing speed of B&prime;, a delay device that delays the n output signals of the pre-coding circuit, and an exclusive OR circuit that performs exclusive OR on the n delayed output signals, it is possible to generate n time division multiplexed pre-coded signals having a line rate of B&equals;n&times;B&prime;, and an increase in the line rate of a transmission system can be easily realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention explained above, in order to realize a high speed optical transmitter and optical transmission system using the RZ optical intensity modulation format used with phase modulation, the optical transmitter is provided with a pre-coding device that generates a differential pre-coded NRZ signal whose logic inverts each time a mark bit is input as an NRZ signal; an optical phase modulation device that carries out optical phase modulation on a single longitudinal mode optical signal generated by a light source using the differential pre-coded NRZ signal generated by the pre-coding device; and an optical filter device that converts the phase modulated optical signal generated by the optical phase modulating device to an RZ optical intensity modulated signal. Thereby, the loss of the optical modulator is decreased and enhancing the high-speed operation of the optical modulator becomes easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition, by carrying out an analog processing function in the optical carrier frequency domain that was conventionally carried out in baseband frequency domain, the speed of the analog signal conversion processing can be increased, and furthermore, by making all electrical signals binary NRZ format, the amplifier circuits such as drive circuits can be easily realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At the same time, by employing a periodic optical filter, simultaneous PSK-ASK conversion of the wavelength division multiplexed signals becomes possible, and by using a passive optical filter, the synchronization between several optical modulators in the active high-speed signal processing can be omitted, and it becomes possible to provide an optical transmitter and optical transmission system that uses the RZ optical intensity modulation format along with phase modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the present invention, simultaneous conversion of the phase modulated wavelength division multiplexed signals to intensity modulated WDM signals becomes possible by the parallel processing of the optical filter. Furthermore, by phase modulating a dual mode beat pulse signal, an RZ phase modulated code or an intensity modulated code having a constant duty cycle can be used as the transmission code. Therefore, narrowing of the optical modulation bandwidth becomes possible, and the efficiency for frequency utilization of the wavelength division multiplexing system can be improved. At the same time, the tolerance of transmission quality degradation due to nonlinear effects can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In addition, by narrowing the optical modulation bandwidth on the receiver side, the chromatic dispersion tolerance can be improved. Furthermore, an increase in the system line rate can be realized without enhancing the operation speed of the pre-coding circuit, the modulator, and the driver for the modulator.</paragraph>

The pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed by an exclusive OR circuit (EXOR <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), a 1-bit delay circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a differential output circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differs from the conventional pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>) in that there is not a logic inversion circuit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for inverting the logic of the input data signal. </paragraph>

The optical phase modulating unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> amplifies the signal as necessary by using the baseband amplifier <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and supplies it to the MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, following the operating conditions described above, the MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generates the DPSK optical signal that is encoded using a DPSK (differential phase shift keying) format. The DPSK optical signal is input into the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) type optical filter that forms the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and whose rejection band center frequency matches the optical carrier frequency of the DPSK optical signal.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E and 4F</cross-reference>, the MZI optical filter outputs a signal in accordance with a phase change rule that is identical to that of the DCS-RZ signal, whose phase is inverted with each mark bit. In the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optically modulated signal of the rejection band is separated by the 3 dB directional coupler <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and output from the cross port <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Thereby, by terminating the cross port <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by means of angled polishing or the like, the reflected wave in the optical filter rejection band does not return to either the through port <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the input port <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and thus the reflection can be sufficiently reduced. </paragraph>

The difference between the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is that the optical pulse is chirped so that the optical phase thereof changes over time and that optical intensity thereof does not change. </paragraph>

The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> differs from the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in that instead of the <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> dB directional couplers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the Y-branching waveguides <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are used in the optical branching unit of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer type filter that forms the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

One optical signal passes through the optical delay element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a delay amount T, is multiplexed with another optical signal by the Y-branching waveguide <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and the multiplexed optical signal is output from the output port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Below, the optical transmission system using the optical transmitter described above will be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an embodiment of the optical transmission system according to the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the binary NRZ input electrical signal is converted to an RZ signal by the optical transmitter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, is optically amplified by the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as necessary to a predetermined signal power, and is subsequently supplied to the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> can be formed from only an optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>.

Thereby, waveform distortion due to the dispersion of the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> (chromatic dispersion or polarization mode dispersion) is compensated.

The experimental signal used in the experimental system shown here was a 42.7 Gbit/s M sequence pseudorandom (PN) signal (with the pattern length of 2<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>&minus;1). Here, the pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> converted the PN signal to an identical PN signal, and thus the pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The temperature of the MZI filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> was controlled, and thereby the rejection frequency of the MZI filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> was adjusted to match the carrier frequency of the DFB-LD. By operating the MZI optical filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with this type of operating conditions, the MZI filter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> output a DCS-RZ code. In addition, the output DCS-RZ code was amplified by an EDFA optical amplification post-amplifier (an erbium doped optical fiber amplifier) <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, transmitted through a 1.55 &mgr;m zero dispersion optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and then input into an optical receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> At the optical receiver, the signal was amplified by the EDFA optical amplification pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>.

A dual mode beat pulse signal whose repetition frequency is equal to the line rate is generated by the dual mode beat pulse generating unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. The details of this unit will be explained below because a structure identical to the two beat generating pulse unit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> can be used. </paragraph>

This differs from the optical transmission system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> in that the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting optical filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed inside the receiver disposed at the output of the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. A 1-bit delay Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter is used as the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting optical filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and in the case of considering the frequency setting identical to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>C, the optical output of the two arms of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter becomes a complementary optical intensity modulated output signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15E and 15F</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in the case that a direct detection receiver carries out regeneration by using this type of delay detection, it can be understood that the alternating phase modulation by the dual mode beat pulse on the transmitting side does not influence the result of the demodulation of the data. In the optical receiving unit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A, the received optical phase modulated RZ signal can be converted to the intensity modulated signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</cross-reference> using the MZI optical filter, and can be received at the normal direct detection receiver. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>B, the received optical phase modulated RZ signal is converted to the intensity modulated signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</cross-reference> using the MZI optical filter, directly detected and then regenerated, and can be demodulated after inverting the logic thereof.

As can be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16D and 16E</cross-reference>, the optical duobinary component is included in the demodulated intensity modulated signal components. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A, 231</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>J, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>G, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>H, a band pass filter such as the ones in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 231 and 24</cross-reference>G is provided in the receiver, and by direct detection, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23J and 24H</cross-reference>, an arbitrary optical duobinary signal component included in the demodulated signal can be obtained, and the chromatic dispersion tolerance can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the optical duobinary signal spectrum can be extracted from the signal spectrum of the received optical phase modulated RZ signal by filtering, and thereby, the chromatic dispersion tolerance can be almost doubled in comparison to the case of using the receiver shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24D, 24G</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>H, the optical duobinary component of the upper side band is extracted, but the optical duobinary component of the lower side band can also be extracted. In addition, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A, 23I</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>J, the optical duobinary component that includes the carrier frequency is extracted, but either one of the upper or lower optical duobinary components can be extracted. Specifically, by using a phase modulated code that has been RZ intensity modulated as the transmission code, the tolerance with respect to the optical nonlinear effects on the optical transmission medium can be improved, and at the receiving side, by carrying out phase modulation/amplitude modulation conversion and then limiting the signal band in the optical carrier frequency domain, the chromatic dispersion tolerance of the transmission line ban be improved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference> is an example in which the equivalent functions of the MZI filter <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>A and the band limiting optical band pass filter <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> are realized by one Gaussian filter <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, which is easily realized. Specifically, like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>A, the RZ phase modulated signal that is transmitted over the optical transmission medium is amplified by the optical pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, and then the center frequency of the Gaussian filter <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is matched with the center frequency of the desired optical duobinary component, and the phase modulation/amplitude modulation conversion and the band limiting function can be realized by a single device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of the structure of a phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting optical filter used in the transmitter or the receiver according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the case of using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter, there is the problem that the transmittance characteristics change due to the input polarization state. In particular, in the case of using this type of optical filter on the receiver side, for example, in the case of using an optical fiber as an optical transmission medium, there is the problem that the receiver characteristics fluctuate due to changes in the polarization state after transmission. The structure of a phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting filter that solves this problem is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the optical phase modulated signal is input into the port 1 of the circulator <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>, and output from the port 2 of the circulator <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>. The optical phase modulated signal from the port 2 is input into the polarization beam coupler/splitter <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, and separated into two linearly polarized wave components which are orthogonal to each other. The polarization axis of one of the optical phase modulated signal components of the split polarization components is rotated by 90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Two polarization separated signals are coupled to either a TE propagatiori mode or a TM propagation mode of the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting optical filter. The optical signals are propagated together in the opposite directions, and have undergone phase modulation/amplitude modulation conversion with the same transmission mode. The converted intensity modulation signal is again input into the polarization beam coupler/splitter <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, is polarization-combined, and then output from the port <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the polarization beam coupler/splitter <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, and input into the port <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the circulator <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>. The demodulated intensity modulation signal that has been polarization-combined can be extracted from the port 3 of the circulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Due to having this type of structure, no matter the polarization state of the input optical phase modulated signal, it is always only sensitive to filter characteristics in one direction of polarization. Thereby, phase modulation/amplitude modulation conversion that is not influenced by the polarization sensitivity of the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting filter can be realized. </paragraph>

In the case that the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is not used, when the input polarization changes, a maximum shift in the transfer function of approximately 9 GHz can be observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In contrast, by using the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B, a</cross-reference> transfer function of the optical filter that is almost completely insensitive to the input polarization can be realized, and it is confirmed that a stable phase modulation/amplitude modulation signal conversion can be realized. </paragraph>

In addition, D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are time division multiplexed to generate the binary NRZ multiplexed signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30D</cross-reference> shows the data generated by pre-coding this multiplexed signal. The signal generated by the DPSK modulation of D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using time division multiplexing is phase modulated in conformity to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30D</cross-reference>. The optical transmitter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> generates the multiplexed phase modulated signal by carrying out the processing using the processing block of the optical carrier frequency band instead of carrying out multiplexing in the baseband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>J, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30E and 30F</cross-reference> are pre-coded NRZ data P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that have been obtained by converting D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, and the code is inverted each time a mark bit is input. The pre-coded NRZ data P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is delayed by T/2 (where T is one time slot of the input data signals D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) as a relative delay difference in comparison to P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

The DPSK modulators <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> carry out phase modulation using P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with a DPSK format in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30G</cross-reference> at a timing delayed by T/2 in comparison to the phase modulation timing of D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30F</cross-reference>. As a result, the DPSK modulators <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> output a signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30H</cross-reference>. It can be understood that a phase modulated signal, which is the same as the phase modulated signal obtained from one of the DPSK modulator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, is generated using the multiplexed data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30D</cross-reference> that is obtained by the time division multiplexing of D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pre-coding of the multiplexed signal. The signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>H and the 1 bit delayed signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 301</cross-reference> are combined using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer type modulator, and when phase modulation/amplitude modulation conversion is carried out, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J, a</cross-reference> signal has been demodulated that is identical to the original multiplexed signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing yet another embodiment of the pre-coding device (in the case of a 1 bit delay) used in the optical transmitter according to the present invention. The embodiment shown is basically the same as the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, but instead of carrying out exclusive OR of a plurality of delayed pre-coded multiplexed signals in the optical phase modulator using the carrier frequency, this is carried out using the baseband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Here, the two synchronized independent NRZ signal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and NRZ signal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having identical line rates of B are each pre-coded by the pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>.

One of the pre-coded NRZ signal is delayed by the delay element, the relative delay difference of each of the phase modulation timings is set equal to T<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>/2, and the exclusive OR is processed by the exclusive OR circuit <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The output of this exclusive OR circuit <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is equal to the pre-coded signal after the NRZ <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input signal and the NRZ <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> input signal are multiplexed by bit interleaving </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above explanation, a pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is difficult to operate at high speed, can be realized by performing parallel processing using a pre-coding circuit that operates as a low speed. As a result, increasing the speed of the pre-coding unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be easily realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Here, the optical carrier frequencies (f<highlight><subscript>01 </subscript></highlight>to f<highlight><subscript>0n</subscript></highlight>) of the transmitter are set in agreement with each of the channel grids of the wavelength division multiplexing system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an embodiment in which the channel spacing is equal. In each optical transmitter, the optical carrier signal from the light source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is modulated using a DPSK optical modulation format by the MZ optical intensity modulator <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Baseband signal processing by the DPSK optical modulation format is identical to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The DPSK optical modulated signals modulated by the optical transmitter for each channel are wavelength division multiplexed by the wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing filter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. After the wavelength division multiplexed DPSK optical modulation code is optically amplified according to necessity, it is input into the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. The rejection band optical center frequency of the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is set the optical carrier frequency of each channel, and in addition, the period thereof is set to the grid period of the wavelength division multiplexed channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> By setting the operating conditions of the optical filter unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in the above manner, the periodic optical filter unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> simultaneously converts the wavelength division multiplexing DPSK optical modulated signals to a wavelength division multiplexing DCS-RZ optical modulated signals. As an example of the periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, an MZI type optical filter can be used as an optical filter unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the simultaneously converted DCS-RZ optical modulation code is optically amplified by the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> according to necessity, and input into the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> at a predetermined transmission channel power. The optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a linear repeating transmission line having an optical fiber that is optically directly amplified and repeated by an optical amplifier repeater. The output of the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is optically amplified, and then input into the wavelength demultiplexing filter <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the DSC-RZ code is wavelength demultiplexed by each channel, and input into the optical receiver <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> after wavelength demultiplexing. The operation in the optical receiver <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is identical to that of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Moreover, here, in the transmitter <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> that uses the wavelength division multiplexing transmission scheme, only an example was given in which a plurality of channels are simultaneously converted to RZ intensity modulated signals by the wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing filter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, but the same effect can be attained by making the polarization of the adjacent wavelength channels orthogonal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A through 36D</cross-reference> are diagrams for explaining the operation of the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The carrier signals (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</cross-reference>) disposed at equal spacing in the optical frequency domain are each modulated using the DPSK format, and the output of the wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing filter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> becomes a wavelength division multiplexed DPSK optical signal spectrum such as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</cross-reference>. The optical filter unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is one essential component of the present invention, can be realized by using a periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> such as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36D</cross-reference> shows the optically modulated spectrum of the converted wavelength division multiplexing DCS-RZ code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> As explained above, by using the periodicity of one periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the wavelength division multiplexing DPSK optical signals can be converted simultaneously to wavelength division multiplexing DCS-RZ optical modulated signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the embodiments of the present invention, the wavelength division multiplexing having equal spacing was assumed in the explanation, but unequal spacing can be used, and in this case, optical filters having equal transfer functions in the optical signal band of the respective channels are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> is a diagram for explaining yet another embodiment of the optical transmission system according to the present invention. The differences between this embodiment and the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> are that the transmission format is a phase encoded RZ format using a dual mode beat pulse and that a phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is disposed at the receiving end. The optical transmission medium can be a linear repeating transmission line having an optical fiber that is optically amplified and repeated by the optical amplifier repeater <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22C</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</cross-reference> are used as an optical receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Here, the optical carrier frequency (f<highlight><subscript>01 </subscript></highlight>to f<highlight><subscript>0n</subscript></highlight>) of the transmitter are set to match each of the channel grids of the wavelength division multiplexing system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A through 38E</cross-reference> show examples in which the wavelengths are equally spaced (3B, which is three times the line rate). Each of the optical transmitters can have the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Here, the phase modulating unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be any of the structures shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 7</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The baseband processing using the DPSK optical modulation format is identical to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 29</cross-reference>, and thus the explanation thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The DPSK-CS-RZ signals (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>) modulated by the optical transmitters of respective channels is wavelength division multiplexed by the wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing filter <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The wavelength division multiplexed DPSKCS-RZ optical transmission code is optically amplified according to necessity, and then input into the optical transmission medium <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38C</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the relationship between the optical carrier frequency f<highlight><subscript>0i </subscript></highlight>(i&equals;1 to n) of each of the optical transmitters and the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting periodic filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>E, a 1-bit delay Mach-Zehnder optical filter is used as the optical periodic filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. If the pass band arrangement for the optical periodic filter is selected as shown by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>C, then as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>D, differential output RZ optical intensity modulated signals are generated by simultaneous conversion, and it is output from the optical periodic filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In addition, if the pass band arrangement is selected as shown by the dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>C, then as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>E, sum output RZ optical intensity modulated signals are generated by simultaneous conversion, and it is output from the optical periodic filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. One of the above RZ optical intensity modulated signals generated by simultaneous conversion is demultiplexed by wavelength by a wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing/demultiplexing filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and demodulated at each of the optical receivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The FSR should be set equal to or greater than the line rate B. For example, considering WDM having a line rate of 43 Gbit/s and a 100 GHz spacing, demodulation is possible even if the FSR of the optical phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (MZI optical filter) is 50 GHz. In addition, in the case that an MZI filter can be used as the optical phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, polarization insensitive optical phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an embodiment in the case that the function of the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting periodic optical filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the function of the wavelength-division-multiplexing-light multiplexing/demultiplexing filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are realized by one optical filter. In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A through 40C</cross-reference> are diagrams for explaining the conversion operation of the filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, like the receiving unit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the wavelength division multiplexing RZ phase encoded signal is input into the receiver <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> after being transmitted over an optical transmission medium such as an optical filter. In the optical receiver <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the wavelength division multiplexed signals are amplified together by the optical amplifying pre-amplifiers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and input into the wavelength demultiplexer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The center frequency of the pass band in each of the channels of the wavelength demultiplexer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is set to the carrier frequency of each of the channels. Here, the wavelength division multiplexing having equal spacing was assumed in the explanation, but unequal spacing can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The pass band shape of the wavelength demultiplexer is a Gaussian, and its FWHM is set from 0.5 to 0.6 times the channel line rate. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A through 26C</cross-reference>, the FWHM is set to 0.56 times the line rate. By setting in this manner, the wavelength division multiplexing RZ phase modulated signals are simultaneously converted into wavelength division multiplexed duobinary signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The advantage of this scheme is that realization of optical phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting filter is easy and the loss in the pass band is low. In addition, a Gaussian filter whose pass band is insensitive to the input polarization can be used. For example, when the array waveguide grating filter disclosed in the citation, H. Takahashi, K. Oda, H. Toba, and Y. Inoue, &ldquo;Transmission characteristics of arrayed waveguide N&times;N wavelength multiplexer&rdquo;, IEEE J. Lightwave Technol, 13, No. 3, pp. 447-455, 1995, is used, a wavelength division multiplexing demultiplexer using a Gaussian filter having uneven spaces or even spaces can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> When the optical phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting filter has the above operating conditions, the periodic filter simultaneously converts the wavelength division multiplexing DPSK optical modulated signals to wavelength division multiplexing RZ signals. </paragraph>

The fiber transmission line was a 200 km optical amplifier and repeater transmission line, and each span comprised of a 100 km dispersion shifted fiber (loss, 0.21 dB; dispersion value, &plus;2 ps/nm/km; dispersion slope, 0.07 ps/km/nm). The dispersion of the first span is compensated by the optical amplifier repeater such that the center wavelengths of channel 2 and channel 3 have zero dispersion, and the output of the first span is input into the second span. </paragraph>

The output of the fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is optically amplified, demultiplexed by wavelength, and then the chromatic dispersion of the transmission line is compensated by the chromatic dispersion compensating device D (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>A, the signal received by the direct detection receiver <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is regenerated. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>B, the dispersion compensated optical signal is input into the MZI filter, which serves as the phase modulation/amplitude modulation converting optical filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and after being converted to an intensity modulated signal, the signal received by the direct detection receiver <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is regenerated. </paragraph>

As can be understood from these results, the RZ format transmission scheme described above has a wide dispersion tolerance. The allowable channel power for which the transmission characteristics for all channels remain within an eye opening penalty of 1 dB is determined by channels 2 and 3, and is approximately &plus;5 dBm. </paragraph>

As can be understood from these results, the RZ format transmission scheme described above has a wide dispersion tolerance in comparison to conventional technology. In addition, allowable channel power for which the transmission characteristics for all channels remain within an eye opening penalty of 1 dB is determined by channels 2 and 3, and is approximately &plus;8 dBm. </paragraph>
