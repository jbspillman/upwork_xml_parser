<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a high precision chromatic dispersion measuring method that precisely measures chromatic dispersion values of the optical transmission line in an optical link system that uses an optical transmission line having chromatic dispersion such as an optical fiber, and then calculates a compensation amount for the measured chromatic dispersion. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an automatic dispersion compensating optical link system that automatically compensates chromatic dispersion in the optical transmission line and also polarization mode dispersion by controlling a dispersion compensator based on a compensation amount calculated using the above method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This application is based on Patent Application No. 2001-198137 filed in Japan, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In an optical link system that uses high-speed channels, degradation in the waveform is generated by the chromatic dispersion or higher order dispersion such as a dispersion slope of the optical fiber and the like forming the optical transmission line, and the degradation in the transmission quality which is created by the degradation is a problem. Specifically, the degradation is generated as a result of chromatic dispersion in the optical fiber or higher order dispersion thereof acting on the bandwidth of the optical signal causing the optical pulse waveform to breakdown, and allowing interference from adjacent optical pulses to be received. Moreover, because the chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber and the like also varies due to the ambient temperature, this also affects the stability of the transmission quality. Furthermore, a similar problem is also created when a chromatic dispersion is changed because of route switching when a fault such as a broken line occurs in a particular transmission section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to solve these problems various chromatic dispersion measuring methods and automatic dispersion compensating optical link systems combined with dispersion compensation technologies have been proposed. One of these is a method in which the intensity of an optical clock signal extracted from received optical signals is monitored and the chromatic dispersion values are controlled such that the intensity is set either to the maximum or the minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> show the relationship between optical clock signal intensity and chromatic dispersion values for an 40 Gbit/s RZ signal generated using optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) and for a normal RZ signal with a duty ratio of 50% (cited document: G. Ishikawa and H. Ooi, &ldquo;Demonstration of Automatic Dispersion Equalization in 40 Gbit/s OTDM Transmissions&rdquo;, Technical Digest of European Conference on Optical Communication, pp. 519-520, 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because the optical clock signal intensity in the 40 Gbit/s RZ signal generated using OTDM shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference> has a local minimum value at the point when the eye opening is at maximum, the chromatic dispersion values are controlled such that the optical clock signal intensity is a local minimum value. In contrast, in the case of the RZ signal with a duty ratio of 50% shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>B, the chromatic dispersion values are controlled such that the optical clock signal intensity shows the maximum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the above described conventional method, a simple correlation is assumed between the optical clock signal intensity and the eye-opening, and makes use of the characteristic that when the optical clock signal intensity becomes a local minimum value in an OTDM signal, and when the optical clock signal intensity reaches maximum in an RZ signal, the chromatic dispersion amount of the optical signal is zero and the eye opening reaches the maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, this is only true in the case where the incident light power into the optical fiber is sufficiently small and phase modulation caused by non-linear optical effects can be negligible. In contrast, in an actual transmission system there is practically no way to carry out the transmission under the above conditions and it is not possible to disregard the influence of non-linear optical effects such as cross phase modulation in wavelength division multiplexing and four-wave mixing, and self phase modulation effects. Namely, in a transmission medium such as an optical fiber, self phase modulation is generated by the optical non-linearity of the transmission medium itself, and due to the interaction of this self phase modulation and of the chromatic dispersion it cannot be guaranteed that zero dispersion will be the optimum dispersion value. In such cases, there is no guarantee that the point where the local minimum (maximum) clock signal intensity and the eye opening is at maximum will match the point where the chromatic dispersion is at zero. Namely, in the conventional technology it is difficult to achieve a sufficient suppression in transmission quality degradation using chromatic dispersion compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as described above, because the optimum dispersion value is obtained when the optical clock signal intensity is at the local minimum value and at the maximum value for an OTDM signal and RZ signal, respectively, the control method differs greatly in accordance with the encoding format. Furthermore, although in an OTDM signal the optical clock signal intensity is at the local minimum value when the eye opening is at maximum, two local maximums exist in the vicinity of the local minimum value. Therefore, to keep the optical clock signal intensity automatically to the local minimum value is extremely difficult. Moreover, as the maximum of the optical clock signal intensity is 0.8 and the minimum thereof is 0.4, the dynamic range thereof is only 3 dB. Accordingly, it is also difficult to perform stable control from the viewpoint of the SN ratio as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the conventional technology, when monitoring the optical clock signal intensity in accordance with the chromatic dispersion, the optical clock signal intensity changes in the same way regardless of whether the chromatic dispersion shifts to the positive side or to the negative side, and the direction of the shift of a chromatic dispersion value is unknown. Therefore, in order to determine that direction, it is necessary to intentionally generate degradation in the eye opening by shifting the chromatic dispersion value. Namely, because it is not possible to avoid the degradation in the transmission quality caused by the degradation in the eye opening, monitoring the optical clock signal intensity while transmission is being performed has been difficult. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the basic structure of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the present embodiment is provided with an optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits a carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signal generated using carrier suppressing means and binary NRZ code or partial response code, or transmits a carrier suppressed clock signal generated using carrier suppressing means and clock signals. The optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> divides into bands and receives a carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signal or a carrier suppressed clock signal transmitted via an optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, extracts a binary NRZ signal or partial response signal components or clock signals, and performs dispersion compensation based on chromatic dispersion values calculated from the phase information thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It is also possible for an optical amplifier to be disposed at either the transmission end or the receiving end of the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or else partway between the two so that sufficient optical power is obtained to ensure a sufficient SN ratio in the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, a basic example is described in which a carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signal (referred to below as a DCS-RZ optical signal) generated from a duobinary signal is transmitted as partial response code, while at the receiving side a DCS-RZ optical signal is divided into bands and is received, and a relative phase difference in the baseband thereof is detected. However, the same description applies when binary NRZ code, multilevel partial response code, or clock signals are used. A detailed description of DCS-RZ optical signals is given in &ldquo;Duobinary Carrier-Suppressed Return-to-Zero Format and its Application to 100 GHz-spaced 8&times;43-Gbit/s DWDM Unrepeatered Transmission over 163 km&rdquo;, Miyamoto Y. et al., Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition 2001, OFC 2001, Vol. 2, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Structural Example of the Optical Transmitting Apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a first structural example of the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed by a continuous wave light source that outputs continuous wave light, a push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that generates optical duobinary signals by performing intensity modulation and phase modulation on continuous wave light using duobinary signals, and a push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that performs RZ encoding on optical duobinary signals by alternating phase differences using clock signals to the optical duobinary signals so as to convert them to DCS-RZ optical signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The continuous wave light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> uses, for example, a DFB laser. The push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are Mach-Zehnder interferometer types optical intensity modulators formed on a lithium niobate (LN) substrate or a semiconductor substrate. On the two arms of each are provided electrodes for the respective modulations, and by driving both complementarily it is possible to perform chirp free modulation. Note that if an X-cut structure is employed here it is possible to achieve chirp free modulation using only one electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The operation of the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will now be described. Three-level duobinary signals converted from binary signals are input complementarily into each electrode of the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thereby push-pull driven, resulting in continuous wave light output from the continuous wave light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> undergoing intensity modulation and phase modulation, and thereby creating optical duobinary signals having approximately half the bandwidth of normal NRZ encoded signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> These optical duobinary signals are input into the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and modulated by push-pull driving using synchronous clock signals. At this time, the operating voltage is set so that the transmittance is minimum when unmodulated, and the frequency of the drive clock signals is set to half (N/2 Hz) the bit rate N bit/s of the optical duobinary signals generated in the previous stage. As a result, the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has gate characteristics that have a function of performing alternate phase RZ encoding, and DCS-RZ optical signals are generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> These operations are schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows optical duobinary signals output from the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the previous stage. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the gate phase of the push-pull drive of the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is set to match the phase of the optical duobinary signals of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As a result, RZ encoded optical signals having the inter-bit phase differences shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> are obtained. This is the waveform of the DCS-RZ optical signals and, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, the carrier component in the optical spectrum is suppressed so as to form an optical spectrum having two optical duobinary components with a frequency difference of N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Note that the frequency of the clock signals driving the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the later stage may also be set generally as mN/2 Hz (wherein m is a positive integer) for the bit rate N bit/s of the optical duobinary signals generated in the previous stage. For example, if m&equals;2, then the frequency difference of the two optical duobinary components of the DCS-RZ optical signals is double (i.e., 2 N Hz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Second Structural Example of the Optical Transmitting Apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a second structural example of the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is structured such that continuous wave light output from the continuous wave light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is input into the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is modulated using clock signals, and undergoes alternate phase RZ encoding. The carrier suppressed clock signals thus generated are then input into the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where they are modulated using duobinary signals. Namely, DCS-RZ optical signals are generated by push-pull driving the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the previous stage using clock signals (frequency of N/2), and by push-pull driving the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the later stage using duobinary signals (bit rate N). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Third Structural Example of the Optical Transmitting Apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The push-pull driving signals for the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are not limited to duobinary signals and it is also possible to use multilevel partial response code, or binary NRZ code, or clock signals of a frequency that is independent from the clock signals that drive the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In such cases the optical signals output from the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> become carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signals or carrier suppressed clock signals, and two partial response code components or binary NRZ code components or clock signals are divided into bands and are received in the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Fourth Structural Example of the Optical Transmitting Apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show fourth structural examples of the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, examples corresponding to the first structural example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is shown, however, it also applies to the second structural example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> a continuous wave light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used that is structured so as to be able to superpose minute intensity modulation onto continuous wave light using tone signals supplied from the outside of the apparatus. In this case DCS-RZ optical signals are divided into bands and are received by the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the tone signals are then extracted, and the phase state thereof is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Instead of directly modulating the continuous wave light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> using tone signals, it is also possible to employ an external modulation structure that uses an electroabsorption optical modulator or an LN optical modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Further, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, it is also possible to employ a structure in which tone signals are superposed on the duobinary signals, the binary NRZ signals, or the clock signals for driving the push-pull type Mach-Zehnder optical modulator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then the tone signals are extracted in the same way by the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Structural Example of the Optical Receiving Apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the First Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a first structural example of the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed by a band dividing device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that separates the two SSB components (i.e., the USB component and the LSB component) among the spectrum components of transmitted DCS-RZ optical signals; optical receivers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that directly detect the respective USB and LSB components and extract the clock signal components; a phase comparator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that detects the relative phase difference between the clock signal components; and a tunable dispersion compensator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that inputs feedback using the relative phase difference as information for controlling chromatic dispersion and performs chromatic dispersion compensation for the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As the band dividing device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> it is possible to use an optical branching device and two optical band pass filters that separate USB and LSB components respectively, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter formed on an optical fiber or optical waveguide, or an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). The optical receivers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have a photoelectric conversion function and a signal reproduction function, and outputs clock signals extracted using timing extraction circuits. The phase comparator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> employs a mixer that outputs a voltage that corresponds to the phase difference between two clock signal components output from each of the timing extraction circuits of the optical receivers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or determines the phase difference by performing waveform sampling via an A/D converter or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The tunable dispersion compensator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> changes a dispersion amount on the basis of chromatic dispersion control information, and a structure that employs, for example, an AWG (e.g., Hirano A. et al., &ldquo;640 Gbit/s (16 channel/spl times/42.7 Gbit/s) WDM L-band DSF Transmission Experiment Using a 25 nm Bandwidth AWG Dispersion Slope Compensator&rdquo;, Electronics Letters, Vol. 36, No. 19, pp. 1638-1639, 2000) or VIPA (Shirasaki M. et al., &ldquo;Variable Dispersion Compensator Using a Virtually Imaged Phase Array (VIPA) for 40 Gbit/s WDM Transmission Systems&rdquo;, ECOC 2000 PDP), or a variable fiber grating (Ohn. M. M. et al., &ldquo;Dispersion Variable Fiber Bragg Grating Using a Piezoelectric Stack&rdquo;, Electronics Letters, Vol. 32, No. 21, pp. 2000-2001, 1996) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of the operation of the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>E. In the optical spectrum of DCS-RZ optical signals output from the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the two USB and LSB components are separated by a frequency corresponding to a bit-rate N (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>). DCS-RZ optical signals transmitted along the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are input into the band dividing device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the USB and LSB components are respectively selected (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>). The USB and LSB components each undergo squared detection by the optical receivers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>), and clock signals are extracted using a timing extraction circuit (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference>). The phase comparator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> then determines a relative phase difference &Dgr;&PHgr; in the clock signals corresponding to the two USB and LSB components, and feeds it back to the tunable dispersion compensator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as chromatic dispersion control information. The tunable dispersion compensator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> changes the dispersion amount based on the chromatic dispersion control information, and performs control such that a total chromatic dispersion value including the chromatic dispersion value of the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the optimum value during reception. As a result, it is possible to keep the effect of chromatic dispersion on the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a minimum and to maintain a high level and stable transmission quality. </paragraph>

However, if a structure is employed in which the phase difference is determined by waveform sampling via the aforementioned A/D converter or the like as the phase comparator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, then it is not absolutely necessary to extract the clock signals and it is possible to obtain the required chromatic dispersion control information from the time delay of the waveform of the digital signal. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the optical receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed by an optical branching device <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that branches transmitted DCS-RZ optical signals into two; an optical filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that separates out one SSB component (either the USB component or LSB component) from one of the branches; optical receivers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that directly detect the respective DCS-RZ optical signal and the separated SSB component and extract the clock signal component; a phase comparator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that detects the relative phase difference between the clock signal components; and a tunable dispersion compensator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that feedbacks the relative phase difference as information for controlling chromatic dispersion, and performs chromatic dispersion compensation for the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The feature of the present structural example lies in the fact that DCS-RZ optical signals are directly received by the optical receiver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the relative phase difference between the clock signal component extracted from the DCS-RZ optical signals and the clock signal component extracted from the USB component or LSB component thereof is determined. When the clock signal component is extracted from the DCS-RZ optical signals, because the clock signal component is generated by the beats of the two SSB components, no phase shift accompanied with chromatic dispersion is generated. Namely, the present structural example can be used as an extremely stable phase reference, and can improve the reliability of the chromatic dispersion control information being measured. </paragraph>

The range of relative phase differences that can be detected when performing phase detection using clock signals having a low repetitive frequency (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is greater than when performing phase detection using clock signals having a high repetition frequency (f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), allowing the detectable dispersion values to be increased. On the other hand, because the amount of change of the relative phase difference relative to the repetitive period is proportional to the repetitive frequency, the resolution decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the present structural example, because clock signals having an arbitrary center frequency can be extracted this structure can be applied for the precise compensation of chromatic dispersion while the system is in operation, in addition to the broad chromatic dispersion compensation performed when the system is first implemented and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> By employing the above structure, it is possible for the photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be shared. In addition, the electrical components can be integrated and the apparatus can be reduced in size and made more stable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a fourth structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. In order to generate clock signals having the desired repetitive frequency, the present structural example is provided with tunable BPF <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that can be adjusted to the desired center frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> By employing the above structure, it is possible for the components to be shared, which allows the apparatus to be reduced in size and made more stable. In addition, it is possible to detect a chromatic dispersion value using clock signals having an arbitrary repetitive frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when detecting a relative phase difference by changing the repetitive frequency, in order to set an initial value for each repetitive frequency it is necessary to provide a delay corresponding to the repetitive frequency using tunable delayers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> However, for example, the method below may be used in order to make the tunable delayers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> unnecessary. Firstly, a delay corresponding to a repetition frequency (F) in which a nonstandard chromatic dispersion value can be detected in the link system being introduced, is applied. In order to improve the detection resolution of the dispersion value, the relative phase difference is detected using clock signals having a repetitive frequency of 2n (wherein n is an integer)&plus;1 times the frequency (F). By selecting this repetitive frequency it is possible to set an initial value without altering the delay initially applied, and it is possible to correctly detect the relative phase difference including the polarity thereof. Therefore, the tunable delayers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be omitted and the size of the apparatus can be reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a first structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. The feature of the structural example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> that is different from the first structural example of the third embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) is the fact that optical band extracting devices <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are used as means for generating clock signals having an arbitrary repetitive frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> will be described while referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>E. DCS-RZ signals transmitted from the optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are divided into USB and LSB components by the band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>). Next, the carriers of the USB and LSB components respectively and arbitrary center wavelength components are extracted by the optical band extracting devices <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the divided USB and LSB components (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference>). When the USB carrier and an arbitrary center wavelength component and the LSB carrier and an arbitrary wavelength component are then input respectively into a photoelectric conversion devices, they are converted into beat signals that correspond to the optical frequency difference between the carrier and the arbitrary center wavelength (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</cross-reference>) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</cross-reference>), and clock signals that have this optical frequency difference as their repetitive frequency are generated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26D</cross-reference>). The phase comparing device then determines a relative phase difference &Dgr;&PHgr; in the clock signals generated from the USB and LSB components (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26E</cross-reference>), and controls the chromatic dispersion compensating device based on the determined result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the present structural example, because it is possible to extract an arbitrary center frequency component this structure can be used for the precise compensation of chromatic dispersion while the system is in operation, in addition to the broad chromatic dispersion compensation performed when the system is first implemented and the like. Moreover, by using the optical band extracting devices <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the same structure can be applied to even faster optical signals. As a result, bit rate flexibility with regard to the band extracting device so that if even higher speeds are envisioned the structure has the advantage of the number of high frequency components such as the band pass filter being able to be reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a second structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. In this structural example, the USB component and LSB component that have been divided by the band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is switched by the optical switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the optical signals passing through optical band bass filters (OBPF) <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>n that extract optical bands having desired center wavelengths are converted into electrical signals by photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the phases of the two electrical signals are then compared by the phase comparator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight>. The output from the phase comparator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> then passes through an LPF <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is then output to the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As the OBPF <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>n it is possible to use a dielectric multilayer filter, a fiber grating filter, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter formed on an optical fiber or on an optical waveguide, or an arrayed waveguide grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> By employing the above structure, it is sufficient if the photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-n and the phase comparators <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>n have an operating frequency that corresponds to the optical frequency difference between the center frequencies of the respective OBPF <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>n and the carriers of the USB component or LSB component.

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows a second structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. In this structural example, the USB component and LSB component that have been divided by the band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are input, via an optical switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, into optical band bass filters (OBPF) <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>n that extract optical bands having desired center wavelengths. The extracted optical bands are then input, via an optical switch <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, into the photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and are converted into two electrical signals. The phases of the two electrical signals thus obtained are then compared by the phase comparator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight>, and the output from the phase comparator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> then passes through an LPF <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and is then output to the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The optical switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> mechanically switch the optical waveguide and may be formed by MEMS switches, acoustooptic (AO) switches, or thermo-optic (TO) switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> By employing the above structure, it is possible for the photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and for the phase comparator <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> to be shared. In addition, the electrical components can be integrated and the apparatus can be reduced in size and made more stable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a fourth structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. In order to generate clock signals having the desired repetitive frequency, the present structural example is provided with tunable OBPF <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that can be adjusted to the desired center frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> By employing the above structure, it is possible for the components to be shared, which allows the apparatus to be reduced in size and made more stable. In addition, it is possible to detect the chromatic dispersion value using the clock signals having arbitrary repetitive frequencies. Furthermore, for example, the method described in the fourth structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the third embodiment can be used to render the tunable delayers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Next, the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the fifth embodiment will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;First Structural Example of the Automatic Dispersion Compensating Optical Link System of the Fifth Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a first structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. In the above described third and fourth embodiments, the chromatic dispersion is compensated by the detected relative phase difference in clock signals extracted from band divided USB and LSB components. The fifth embodiment differs in that polarization mode dispersion is compensated by monitoring the intensity of extracted clock signals. The optical transmitting apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> transmits carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signals generated using carrier suppressing means and binary NRZ code or partial response code. Carrier suppressed RZ encoded optical signals transmitted via the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are branched by the optical branching device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and one branch is input into an optical receiver <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> while the other branch is input into a band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. After the binary NRZ code or the partial response code has been extracted by the band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, photoelectric conversion is performed by photoelectric converters <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the respective components are converted into basebands. Next, bands having arbitrary center frequencies are extracted from the converted basebands, and the chromatic dispersion compensating device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is controlled so as to compensate the chromatic dispersion based on a chromatic dispersion value calculated from phase information. The intensity of at least one of the extracted bands is monitored by intensity detection device <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the polarization mode dispersion compensating device <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is controlled so that the dispersion of the polarization mode is compensated such that this intensity is at maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> It is also possible for an optical amplifier to be disposed at either the transmission end or the receiving end of the optical transmission line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or else partway between the two so that sufficient optical power is obtained to ensure a sufficient SN ratio in the optical receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Two optical band pass filters that respectively divide the USB and LSB components, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer type optical filter formed on an optical fiber or optical waveguide, or an arrayed waveguide grating can be used as the band dividing device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The phase comparing device <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is structured so as to use a mixer that outputs a voltage that corresponds to the phase difference between two clock signals output from the band extracting devices <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or is structured so as to determine the phase difference by performing waveform sampling via an A/D converter or the like. The chromatic dispersion compensating device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is structured so as to change a chromatic dispersion value on the basis of chromatic dispersion control information, and a structure that employs, for example, an AWG, a structure that employs virtually imaged phased array (VIPA), or a structure that employs a tunable fiber grating may be used for the chromatic dispersion compensating device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The intensity detection device <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be formed, for example, by an RF spectrum analyzer or by using an RF power meter. The polarization mode dispersion compensating device <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is structured such that it can change the polarization mode dispersion value so that the intensity monitored by the intensity detection device <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is at maximum. Such structures include, for example, a structure in which a fixed polarization mode dispersion value is applied and the power ratio of the two primary states of polarization (PSP) of the input signals is changed; and a structure in which, after the input signal has been split into orthogonal polarizations by a polarization beam splitter (PBS), and the delay in one polarization is optically or electrically changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> According to the present structural example, in addition to it being possible to perform chromatic dispersion compensation, it is also possible to compensate polarization mode dispersion independently from the chromatic dispersion using clock signals detected in the chromatic dispersion compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Second Structural Example of the Automatic Dispersion Compensating Optical Link System of the Fifth Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows a second structural example of the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system. The structural example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is basically the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, however, the structural example of the fifth embodiment can be applied in all of the structural example described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> An example of an algorithm for the chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion compensation methods is shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> When the system is started up the relative phase difference in the clock signals is detected and the chromatic dispersion is compensated. After the chromatic dispersion has been compensated, the polarization mode dispersion is compensated such that the intensity of the clock signals is at maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> However, when the system is operating both the intensity and relative phase difference of the clock signals are monitored, and the chromatic dispersion is compensated when both of them change. When only the intensity changes the polarization mode dispersion is compensated. In this way, it is possible to compensate chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion independently without affecting the transmitted signals even when the system is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Note that, in addition to the optical signals described in the first, second, and third embodiments, the automatic dispersion compensating optical link system of the present invention can also be used with various code formats such as DPSK format, QPSK format, Duobinary format, BPSK format, CRZ format, CS-RZ format, DCS-RZ format, RZ-DPSK format (T. Miyano et. al., Tech. Dig. In OECC 2000, paper 14D3-3, July 2000), and CS-RZ-DPSK format disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2002-040855. </paragraph>
