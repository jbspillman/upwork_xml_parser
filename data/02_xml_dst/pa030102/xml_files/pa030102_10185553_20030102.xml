<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for monitoring input parameters of ion-implantation in semiconductor fabricating devices and a monitoring method thereof, and more particularly to an apparatus and method by which input parameters can be remotely monitored during the ion-implantation process of semiconductor fabricating devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, an ion-implantation process involves transforming p-type impurities having three valence electrons (e.g., boron, aluminum, indium) and n-type impurities having five valence electrons (e.g., antimony, phosphorus, arsenic) into a plasma ion beam state. These impurities are thereafter ion-implanted into a semiconductor crystal (e.g., a silicon (Si) wafer) to obtain a conductivity-type, or a non-resistance, device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An ion implantation device for performing such an ion-implantation process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,618 (to Le). The LE ion implantation device can control the concentration of the selected impurity in the range of 10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>-11<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atom/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Ion implantation devices have been widely used as the integration degree increases, since the ion implantation device advantageously can more easily control the concentration of the impurity and more accurately control the depth of ion implantation than is possible with other impurity implantation techniques (e.g., diffusion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since a conventional ion implantation device requires that operation records be controlled and the details thereof be reviewed, a user undertakes such operational history review by outputting the details through a printer connected to the ion implantation device. However, this limitation means that the user heretofore must move to a working site where the apparatus is positioned and directly search and check the printed details in order to repair, control, or maintain the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is generally not possible to accurately monitor the device state with only the printed details. Instead, such details are used to confirm data when a problem with the apparatus is detected. The user therefore is also required to manually search and analyze data, thereby expending time and producing a great volume of paper. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure provides an input parameter monitoring apparatus and a monitoring method thereof by which input parameters for ion implantation can be stored in a database in an ion implantation apparatus during an ion implantation process, thereby allowing a user to overview the entire operational history. Because the apparatus and monitoring method do not need to print operational history details during the ion implantation process, a great volume of paper need not be expended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invented input parameter monitoring system comprises a local computer having coupled thereto a first monitor adapted to display graphic data and text data and a plurality of ion implantation devices communicating with said local computer. Each of the devices include output ports. The local computer is operative to convert ion implantation process log data into text data and store the text data in a database concurrently to graphically process the log data and store the graphic data in a database, and to output the stored graphic data and text data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The system can further include a remote computer operative to collect graphic data and text data input from the local computer through a local-area network and a second monitor coupled to said remote computer and adapted to display said graphic data and text data. The local computer and remote computer can communicate via a local-area network or equivalent means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the monitoring method disclosed herein, input parameters are collected and stored in a database during an ion implantation process involving a plurality of ion implantation devices, thus to enable remote monitoring of the process and devices. The method comprises collecting log data generated by at least one of a plurality of ion implantation devices during said process. The collected log data is listed in a database in chronological order and the database is substantially contemporaneously during said process. The collected log data can be processed to generate processed text data and processed graphic data for display to a user.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the structure of a representative database, in which Bound DB is a database for setting the boundary value of each of parameters; Error DB is a database for errors added when the log is created; Range DB is a database for setting the graph range; Real DB is a database for real time graph; and Total DB is a database for storing all parameters. The various contents are discussed more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The operation according to an embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. First, ion implantation log system software programs in the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are initialized, and environment and output options are selected (steps <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>). At this time, the maximum and minimum values in the graphs and the highest limit and lowest limit values in the collected data are set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In steps <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the TCP/IP protocol is set and the LAN port is opened for communication between the local computer and the remote computer. Such connection schemes are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are synchronized. Thereafter, the plurality of ion implantation devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . ,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>are engaged to perform the ion implantation processes and substantially simultaneously output the results as working and log data, to reflect the device state, through LAN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The actions of the local computer are now described in more detail. In step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then searches log data that are input through the multicard <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to thereby check whether log data are generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If log data are generated, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores the log data received in an extra buffer (step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>), then analyzes the log data received (step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> checks whether end-of-file (EOF) data are detected for a predetermined period. If the EOF data are not detected for a predetermined time, the received data are treated as an error (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>), the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> displays the error message on the monitor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and at the same time transfers the message to the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>), thereafter returning to step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, if the EOF data are detected within a predetermined time, the received data are taken as correct data and a folder is created for storing the log file (step <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>), by utilizing the time in the file name. At this time, the log file is stored as a monthly folder name. Each of the monthly folders contains daily folders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each file preferably is named to reflect its contents. For example, consider a file pertaining to device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>parameters during a process on Dec. 14, 2000. In this example, further assume that the time that parameter data was received was 11:36:45 AM on Dec. 14, 2000. The file would be named &ldquo;200012W20001214W1-20001214113645.DAT&rdquo;, corresponding to parameter data relevant to device &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> received at 11:36:45 AM on Dec. 14, 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The folders can comprise DELETED LOG FILE, LOG, and MERGER FILE. The DELETED LOG FILE is a folder that is temporarily stored when the log is deleted. The LOG is a folder for storing a log file, and the MERGE FILE is a folder for Log Merge. The MERGE FILE is a function by which various events can be combined into one file at a desired time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> reads the stored log data, thereby to update the log data in accordance with the Total DB database (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and also to update the log data to reflect the most recent data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs processing (treatment) and outputs the updated message to the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. An anomaly will be understood to include any predetermined process condition worthy of reporting to a user, e.g. wherein a process parameter is out of a predefined bound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If text mode has been selected, the data will be treated as text. In step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs a text processing, or text treatment, regarding data in the list of recent data, displaying the results on the monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in graphic mode in step <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, it loads parameter data as a set into a database (step <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>). In step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs graphic processing, in real-time, of the loaded parameter data. The local computer then graphically displays the results on the monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At this time, the graphs calculated in a range set by the RANGE DB database are stored as a BMP file. If data for the devices are beyond the scope of the graph, values corresponding to the data are checked through printing, extending the graph function, and a scrolling function for the graph. Graphs are processed according to priority, receiving time and device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An automatic calculation can be performed a predetermined number of times to thereby calculate the log data values that are first received according to predetermined conditions. The scope of the graph can be thereby estimated in accordance with an average of the log values&mdash;for example, in the range of &plusmn;5%. Alternatively, the maximum and minimum values for the graphs can be set by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The values for all ion implantation devices can be set or calibrated to a representative ion implantation device. In addition, trend analysis may be performed on the data and the results can be displayed together with the occurrence or instantiation history, as is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> After such predetermined number of parameters are graphically processed, the system determines whether the implantation process has terminated or is continuing (step <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>). If the ion implantation process is continued, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and proceeds therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the remote computer checks whether data were received. If so, the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> checks (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) whether the received message is a log message (step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>). If not, the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> treats the received message as an error (error processing, step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) and returns to step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. If the received message is a log message, the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> again checks (step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>) whether it is in graphic output mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If it is not a graphic output mode, the remote computer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> downloads a log file (step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) from the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then performs a text processing (text treatment) of the downloaded log message and displays the results on the monitor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as text (step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If a graphic mode has been selected, however, the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> loads a predetermined number of parameters (step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>) as a set for graphic processing. The remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then downloads a list of recent data (step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>) from the local computer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The recent data may include any suitable parameters and groups of parameters; data fields can include beam energy, beam line pressure, arc current, extraction voltage, analyzer magnet field, source magnet field, suppression voltage, scan balance, station pressure, arc voltage, source voltage, angle corrector field, filament current, extraction current, scan amplitude, source pressure, suppression current, or beam current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The downloaded recent data are then graphically processed (step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>) in real-time and the results displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Those data are graphically processed and stored. The remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then determines whether the implantation process has terminated or is continuing (step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>), as is done similarly by the local computer (see step <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described above, after the graphic processing or text processing for the parameters, the remote computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or the local computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can search the parameters, for example for parameters relating to a specific device or a group of devices; times; process conditions (e.g., Dopant, Energy, Dose); and the like. The process conditions can be set by inputting predetermined values for specific parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In a search mode, a user can input a search condition, such as one or more device or process parameters. In one embodiment, a search parameter can be selected via corresponding search icons, texts or graphics displayed on a screen. A user thus may make decisions regarding whether to interrupt, continue or change certain ion-implantation process parameters of one or more devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>in real time via local or remote computer monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, maximum and minimum (top limit and lower limit) values may be predetermined so that an alarm is generated or a stop signal is transferred to the plurality of ion implantation devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . ,<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>through the multi-card <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when the values are beyond the limits, thereby stopping the operation of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, the plurality of ion implantation devices are connected to the multi-card. The local computer, also through the multi-card, can collect parameters corresponding to work results and device conditions to thereafter graphically or textually process them and store the result in a database. As a result, there is no need to print a hardcopy of the results via a printer, thereby reducing costs in checking the state of the devices. Moreover, an ion-implantation process may be remotely monitored in real time display of graphic or text operational data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the sprit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
