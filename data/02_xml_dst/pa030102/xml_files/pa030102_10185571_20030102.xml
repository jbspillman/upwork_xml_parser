<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium such as a CD-ROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, apparatuses that play back a recording medium such as a CD-ROM are widely known as in-vehicle audio equipment (playback apparatuses). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such audio equipment has, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> playback apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> including a playback device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, serving as a casing, and a control panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A shutter base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fixed using screws <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the rear side of the control panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is pivotably mounted on the shutter base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The playback device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which can receive a plurality of CD-ROMs, encases a CD-ROM receiving mechanism, a selector for selecting a designated CD-ROM, a pickup device for playing back the selected CD-ROM, and associated parts (none of which are shown). Also, the playback device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into which the CD-ROM is inserted and a lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for pivoting the shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with its forward movement, the tip of the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> projecting from the opening <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The control panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the playback device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and various selectable switches are provided on the front face of the control panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The control panel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also has a display <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a cassette tape loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and so on, as well as a CD-ROM loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is aligned with the opening <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The shutter base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the CD-ROM to pass through between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the opening <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a shaft <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(only one end is shown) for pivotably supporting the shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for retaining one end of a spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> protrudes from the shutter base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for retaining the other end of the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for blocking the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the elastic force of the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and an arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which is contactable with the tip of the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> moves toward the front of the playback apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the tip of the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> pushes the arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>causes the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to pivot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration described above, for example, when the CD-ROM is played back or when the mechanism for sequentially receiving a plurality of CD-ROMs is being driven, it is necessary to prevent another CD-ROM from being loaded into the playback device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To this end, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is moved by the elastic force of the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so as to block the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When loading of a CD-ROM is permitted, the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> moves toward the front of the playback apparatus <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and pushes the arm <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in order to pivot the shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to overcome the elastic force of the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thus again allowing the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium constructed as described above, when the CD-ROM is inserted at an upward angle from a lower position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, while the shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> blocks the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the leading edge of the CD-ROM abuts against a part around the center in the width direction of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, because the CD-ROM is a thin disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> At this time, due to the load applied by the inserted CD-ROM and the fact the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is wide, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, flexing of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may occur as a result, so that the central part thereof is displaced toward the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Any additional load may cause the CD-ROM to enter into the space between the uppermost edge of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the shutter base <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, resulting in the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>unintentionally pivoting. Accordingly, there is the possibility that the CD-ROM may be accidentally inserted into the playback apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the CD-ROM is inserted at a downward angle from an upper position while the shutter member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> blocks the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, there is the possibility that the load applied by the inserted CD-ROM may cause the shutter blade <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to unintentionally pivot, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in order to solve the problems described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium, which apparatus can prevent an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member due to the load applied when the recording medium is inserted while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium. The apparatus includes a main unit having a loading slot for the recording medium in the front thereof and a shutter member pivotably mounted on a portion of the main unit behind the loading slot for opening and closing the loading slot. The shutter member includes a shutter blade. A recess is provided on the front face of the shutter blade that can be seen from the loading slot, for guiding the recording medium in the closing direction of the shutter member by a load applied to the recording medium when the recording medium is inserted from the loading slot while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member. Such an apparatus can prevent an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member due to the load applied when the recording medium is inserted while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member, particularly an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member when the recording medium is inserted at an upward angle from a lower position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium is provided. The apparatus includes a main unit having a loading slot for the recording medium in the front thereof and a shutter member pivotably mounted on a portion of the main unit behind the loading slot for opening and closing the loading slot. The shutter member includes a shutter blade. A shoulder is formed on a portion of the main unit at a position behind the shutter blade, which shoulder normally allows the shutter member to pivot and engages with a portion of the shutter member that is flexed by a load applied to the recording medium when the recording medium is inserted from the loading slot while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member. Such an apparatus can prevent an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member due to the load applied when the recording medium is inserted while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium is provided. The apparatus includes a main unit having a loading slot for the recording medium in the front thereof and a shutter member pivotably mounted on a portion of the main unit behind the loading slot for opening and closing the loading slot. The shutter member includes a shutter blade. A protrusion is formed on a portion of the main unit at a position behind the shutter blade, which protrusion normally allows the shutter member to pivot and engages with a portion of the shutter member that is flexed by a load applied to the recording medium when the recording medium is inserted from the loading slot, while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member, to restrict a pivotal movement of the shutter member in the opening direction thereof. Such an apparatus can prevent an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member due to the load applied when the recording medium is inserted while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member, particularly an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member when the recording medium is inserted at a downward angle from an upper position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to any combination of the preceding aspects of the present invention, a playback apparatus with a structure for preventing wrong-insertion of a recording medium is provided. Such an apparatus can prevent an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member due to the load applied when the recording medium is inserted while the loading slot is closed by the shutter member, particularly an unintentional pivotal movement of the shutter member when the recording medium is inserted at an upward or downward angle from a lower or upper position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become clear from the following description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The shutter member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>D, a pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for supporting the other end of the spring, a shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for blocking the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the elastic force of the spring, and an arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, which is contactable with the tip of a lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for causing the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to open and close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Further, a recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>having a predetermined width centering around the widthwise midpoint of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which is positioned in the upper part of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is formed on the front face of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration, for example, when the CD-ROM is played back or when the mechanism for sequentially receiving a plurality of CD-ROMs is being driven, it is necessary to prevent another CD-ROM from being loaded into the playback device. To this end, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is moved by the elastic force of the spring, so as to block the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When loading of a CD-ROM is permitted, the lever <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> moves toward the front of the CD autochanger indicated by the left arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and pushes the arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in order to pivot the shutter member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to overcome the elastic force of the spring, thus again allowing the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On one hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, when the CD-ROM is inserted at an upward angle from a lower position while the shutter member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> blocks the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the leading edge of the CD-ROM slides into the recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>owing to the surface configuration of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the CD-ROM is further inserted into the CD autochanger in such a condition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abuts against the upper portion of the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while flexing due to the load applied by the inserted CD-ROM, so that the flexure of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is restricted. This prevents the CD-ROM from being further inserted or from sliding into the space between the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the shutter base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>may be formed all around the edge of the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to further ensure restriction of the deformation of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when flexed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the CD-ROM is inserted at a downward angle from an upper position while the shutter member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> blocks the spatial communication between the loading slot <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the passage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abuts against the shoulder <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>while flexing due to the load applied by the inserted CD-ROM, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. In such a condition, even when the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>attempts to pivot owing to the load applied by the inserted CD-ROM, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abuts against the protrusion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, thus preventing an unintentional pivotal movement. </paragraph>
