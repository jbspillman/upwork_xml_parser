<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transducer which is used in a bonding apparatus and to a bonding apparatus which is structured to include the transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a bonding apparatus including wire bonding apparatuses, a transducer such as an ultrasonic horn and the like is used. Bonding is accomplished by applying a load and ultrasonic vibrations to the bonding section of the horn by causing the transducer to vibrate in the lengthwise direction (axial direction) of the transducer by a vibrator and at the same time by lowering a bonding tool mounted at the tip end of the transducer toward the object of process (bonding) and applying a load thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A conventional supporting structure for such a transducer used in a wire bonding apparatus (not shown) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this transducer, a capillary <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> used as a bonding tool. The capillary <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is attached to the tip end of an ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that is used as a transducer, and a wire (not shown) passes through the capillary <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. An ultrasonic vibrator <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is fastened to the base end of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. A flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which has a cylindrical shape and is connected to the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> at the front end of said flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed on the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided so that it is at a node (i.e., a point where the strain reaches the maximum) position of the ultrasonic vibration, which is applied as a compressional wave (longitudinal wave) in the axial direction, i.e., the direction of length of the horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to a cylindrical horn support <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The horn support <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is fastened to a transducer holder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and this transducer holder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is fastened to a supporting shaft <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The supporting shaft <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is supported on a bonding head (not shown) of the bonding apparatus either directly or via a lifter arm, so that the supporting shaft <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is free to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Wire bonding apparatuses of this type are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) Nos. 5-347334, 6-196532 and 10-303240. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the above prior art, the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at a node position of the ultrasonic vibration in the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the energy loss (so-called leakage) via this flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is small; and thus, a defective crushed shape of the ball, stripping of the ball or damage to the substrate, etc., caused by the continued application of unnecessary ultrasonic energy following the completion of bonding can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, as the operation of the bonding apparatus is performed at higher speeds, oscillation during the raising and lowering movement of the transducer becomes a problem. In this respect, since the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the above prior art is supported at only one place, it is difficult to effectively suppress the oscillation of the transducer caused by the operation of the bonding head. When such oscillation occurs, an excessive force is applied to the ball during bonding, and defects in the crushed shape of the ball occur. This problem is especially conspicuous in the diameters of press-bonded balls that have been reduced as a result of the increasingly finer pitch of recent semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to deal with oscillation of the transducer during the raising and lowering movement of the transducer, the applicant of the present invention has proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 2001-24025 a transducer structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this structure, an ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> used as a transducer is attached to a transducer holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via two horn supporting members <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that are separate elements from the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The attachment positions of the horn supporting members <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the axial direction of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are adjustable. In this structure, since there are two supporting points, oscillation during the raising and lowering movement of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be effectively prevented. Furthermore, a loss of the ultrasonic vibration (compressional wave) in the axial direction of the horn can also be prevented by causing the attachment positions of the horn supporting members <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with respect to the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to coincide with node positions of the vibration of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as the regions where the horn supporting members (horn supporting members <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) are connected to the ultrasonic horn become larger (thicker) in the direction of length of the ultrasonic horn, the portions of these regions that are away from the nodes of the vibration increase. As a result, there is a corresponding increase in the energy loss. More specifically, in order to reduce the energy loss that occurs via the horn supporting members, it is desirable to form the horn supporting members as thin as possible in the axial direction of the ultrasonic horn. However, if the horn supporting members are thin, then there is a corresponding drop in the strength of the horn supporting members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the structure in which the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is supported at a single point as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cutting work for forming the cylindrical flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into a cylindrical shape that is open at one end is difficult, and it is also difficult to reduce the size of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in the structure that uses two horn supporting members <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that are independent elements from the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the total number of parts increases, and assembly becomes bothersome. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a transducer having a structure that provides the supporting members of the transducer with strength and that makes it possible to form such supporting members as thin as possible in the axial direction of the transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The above object is accomplished by a unique structure for a transducer which is caused to vibrate by an operation of a vibrator, and the transducer of the present invention comprises: holding portions which are provided in at least two areas that include nodes (or node positions) of vibration in a transducer main body, and connecting portions that connect the holding portions to each other at areas that differ from areas where the holding portions protrude from the transducer main body; and further the transducer main body, the holding portions and the connecting portions are integrally formed from a single material member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the structure of the above-described transducer of the present invention, the holding portions are disposed in at least two areas that include nodes of vibration in the transducer main body. Accordingly, oscillation of the transducer is prevented without causing a vibrational energy loss in the axial direction of the transducer. Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, the connecting portions that connect the holding portions to each other are provided at areas that differ from areas where the holding portions protrude from the transducer main body. Accordingly, the external force applied to one of the holding portions is dispersed in each of the respective holding portions connected by the connecting portions, and deformation of the holding portions is prevented. Accordingly, the respective holding portions can be formed extremely thin in the axial direction of the transducer main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the transducer main body, holding portions and connecting portions are formed integrally from the same member, a sufficient strength is secured at the connection areas between the holding portions and the transducer main body, and the holding portions can be made even thinner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the transducer of the present invention, the holding portions have a plate-form, and they are disposed in a direction of operation of the transducer main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since the plate-form holding portions are disposed in the direction of operation of the transducer main body, the cross-section of the connection areas between the transducer main body and the holding portions have a shape in which the direction of the length of such areas is equal to the direction of operation of the transducer. Consequently, even in the case of bonding that accompanies large load, a large cross-section is secured at the connection areas between the transducer main body and the holding portions, and the ability to withstand shearing increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, of the holding portions, one holding portion is disposed at an n-th node (n is a natural number) position from the base end of the transducer main body, and another holding portion is disposed at an n&plus;m-th node (m is an odd number) position; and the connecting portions are provided with fastening means for fastening the connecting portions of the transducer to a transducer holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Generally, the vibrational characteristics of a transducer, and especially the characteristic vibration frequency and the vibration period that is the reciprocal of this frequency, are not always the same in individual transducers. In other words, it is considered that a slight variation occurs depending on the working precision, etc. In this regard, the transducer of the present invention is designed so that one holding portion is disposed at the n-th node (n is a natural number) position from the base end of the transducer main body, and another holding portion is disposed at the n&plus;m-th node (m is an odd number) position from the base end of the transducer main body. Accordingly, even in cases where the actual positions of the nodes of vibration are shifted from the designed positions as a result of variation in the vibrational characteristics, the forces acting on the respective holding portions have opposite phases, and thus such forces are cancelled each other in the connecting portions. Accordingly, with the transducer of the present invention, it is possible to avoid such a situation that the energy that leaks out of the transducer main body via the respective holding portions is transmitted as a vibration to the transducer holder that is fastened by the fastening means or to the bonding head driving mechanism that is fastened to this transducer holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, the fastening means are disposed at at least two different locations in a direction of length of the connecting portions of the transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In this structure, since the fastening means are disposed at at least two different points in the direction of length of the connecting portions, oscillation in the direction of operation of the transducer is effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, the fastening means are respectively disposed in positions that are equal to each other in terms of length of vibration transmission paths that are formed by the holding portions and the connecting portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the respective fastening means are disposed in positions that are equal to each other in terms of the length of the vibration transmission paths that are formed by the holding portions and connecting portions. Accordingly, the forces that act on the respective holding portions from the transducer main body have opposite phases at the positions of the fastening means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, the holding portions and the connecting portions are disposed on both sides of the axial center of the transducer main body so that the holding portions and the connecting portions are symmetric with respect to the axial center of the transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this structure, the holding portions and connecting portions are disposed on both sides of the axial center of the transducer main body, and these elements are positionally symmetrical with respect to the axial center. Accordingly, as to two holding portions that are disposed symmetrically on either side of a given node of vibration, the directions of the forces caused by leakage of the vibration of the vibrator are mutually opposite directions. Thus, by way of fastening both of these holding portions to a transducer holder, the leaking energies are cancelled out each other, and the transmission of vibration to the transducer holder or to the bonding head driving mechanism to which this transducer holder is fastened is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the transducer of the present invention, the holding portions and the connecting portions are provided in directions that cross (at right angles) the direction of operation of the transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by utilizing the connecting portions so as to fasten the transducer main body to a transducer holder or to the bonding head driving mechanism, it is possible to increase the dimension of the transducer main body in the direction of operation and especially to increase the clearance on the underside of the transducer main body when the direction of operation is set to be oriented downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the transducer of the present invention includes thin portions disposed between the holding portions and the connecting portions so as to absorb vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With this structure, the transmission of vibrational energy from the holding portions to the connecting portions is buffered by the elastic deformation of the thin portions even in cases where vibrational energy leaks from the transducer main body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The transducer of the present invention is obtained by forming through-holes in a matrix material for the transducer main body and by forming the holding portions and the connecting portions around the through-holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Since the transducer is manufactured by forming through-holes in a matrix material that constitutes the transducer main body and then by forming the holding portions and connecting portions around through-holes, working is simple even in cases where any working method such as cutting, casting, etc. is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the above-described transducer is used in a bonding apparatus, the advantages and effect described above with reference to the transducer are obtained.</paragraph>

In other words, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed so as to project sideways from the ultrasonic horn (transducer main body) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connect the tip end areas of the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, such tip end areas being different (or opposite) from the areas where the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> project from the ultrasonic horn (transducer main body) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured in the following manner: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> First, a mounting hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for mounting a capillary <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is bored by means of a broaching mill in the front-side portion of a round bar material that constitutes the matrix material. In addition, the screw hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is bored in the base end (or the rear-side portion) of the round bar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, the front side and rear side of the round bar material are cut in toward the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by means of a lathe, thus forming a front-side portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a rear-side portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, a top plane <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, bottom plane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and side planes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) are respectively formed by means of a milling machine, and also the outside surfaces of the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed. Furthermore, screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are formed by means of an end mill and tap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Then, through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed in the vertical direction on both sides of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by an end mill. The shape of the through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a top view is invariable (consistent) with respect to the vertical direction. As a result of the boring of the through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are integrally formed around the through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the same or a single matrix material member; and as a result, empty spaces defined by the through holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> surrounded by the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are provided on both sides of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus manufactured is fastened to a horn or transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>), which is C-shaped in cross-section and open at the bottom, by way of screwing bolts <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> into the respective screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fastened to the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at four points on a horizontal plane indicated by the line E-E in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At an appropriate area on the end surface of the base portion of the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is fastened to the bonding head driving mechanism of a wire bonder main body (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The bonding head driving mechanism moves the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to any desired position on the horizontal plane and also applies a desired downward-oriented load to the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, a known ultrasonic vibrator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed by stacking magnetostriction elements in the axial direction is fastened in place in the screw hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is formed in the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A capillary <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set in the mounting hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the above structure, the ultrasonic vibration generated by the ultrasonic vibrator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the base end toward the tip end of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction of length, i.e., along the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as a compressional wave (longitudinal wave). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiment, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are provided in two areas that include the nodes p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of vibration in the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, since these nodes are at points where no vibration occurs, there is no loss of the vibrational energy of the compressional wave (longitudinal wave) along the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and oscillation of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented. In addition, since the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are provided so as to connect the tip ends of the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to each other in locations that differ from the locations where the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> project from the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an external force that is applied to one of the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (e.g., the holding portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is dispersed in each of the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (e.g., the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that are connected by the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, deformation of the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is suppressed, and the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed extremely thin in the direction parallel to the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are integrally formed by being cut from a round bar material that is a single material member, the connection between the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is as strong as a metal connection. Accordingly, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be made much thinner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiment, the flat-plate-form holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and flat-plate-form thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are both formed to extend in the vertical direction (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) in the direction of operation (that is in a vertical direction) of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the cross-sections of the connection areas between the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the cross-sections of the connection areas between the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are both long in the vertical direction. Consequently, even in the case of bonding that accompanies a large load, it is unlikely that a plastic deformation, which is caused by the upward and downward movement of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, occurs in the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or in the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, since the cross-sections of the respective connection areas are formed large, the ability to withstand shearing is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the vibrational characteristics of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and especially the characteristic vibrational frequency and the vibration period that is the reciprocal of this frequency, are not always the same for individual ultrasonic horns. It appears that there is some slight variation depending on the working precision, etc. of the ultrasonic horns <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this regard, in the present invention, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are disposed at point p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is the first node position from the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed at point p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is the second node position. Accordingly, even in a case where the actual nodes of vibration of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are located at points p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which are shifted from the designed positions, the forces acting on the base end and tip end of the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> have mutually opposite phases. For instance, the amplitude applied to the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which are on the base end side of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is positive, and the amplitude applied to the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are on the tip end side is negative. Furthermore, the base end side holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the tip end side holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by the connecting portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, and the base end side holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the tip end side holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to each other by the connecting portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. Accordingly, the forces acting on the base end and tip end of the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are cancelled out each other in the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, a situation, in which the energy that leaks out from the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is transmitted as a vibration to the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> fastened by bolts <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or to the bonding head driving mechanism, can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in addition to the structure in which the positions of two holding portions are set at adjacent nodes as described above, a mutual cancellation of vibrational energies can be obtained also by a different structure in which one holding portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed at an n-th node (n is a natural number) position from the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the other holding portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed at an n&plus;m-th node (m is an odd number) position from the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For instance, two holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be disposed at the first node p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and other two holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the fourth node p<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or they can be at the third node p<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and fourth node p<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the holding portions S that are at a first position from the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be disposed at some other desired node position instead of the first node position. However, in order to effectively reduce the leakage of vibrational energy to the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that accompanies the variation in the above-described vibrational characteristics, it is most desirable that the first holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the base end of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> be disposed at the first node p<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is the closest node position to the ultrasonic vibrator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the transducer described above, two screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that are the fastening means are disposed at different positions in the direction of length of the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, oscillation in the direction of operation of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (that corresponds to the vertical direction D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is effectively prevented. Moreover, the number of points where fastening is made via screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be three or more (instead of two points), and the same effect can be expected in such structures. Furthermore, some other fastening means besides screws may also be used. In the structure described above, the screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and bolts <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are employed, and the bolts <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are screwed in toward the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. With this structure, a high dimensional precision with respect to the vibration is maintained compared to cases where the bolts are screwed in some other direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the shown embodiment, the screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are disposed at positions that are equal to each other in terms of the length of the vibration transmission paths that are formed by the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (in concrete terms, such a &ldquo;length&rdquo; is the distance from the connection areas between the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the axial centers of the screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the paths that run along the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, the forces that act on the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is caused to have mutually opposite phases at the positions of the screw holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiment, further, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are disposed on both sides of the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that these elements are symmetrical with respect to this axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>). Accordingly, for two holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that are symmetrically disposed on both sides of a certain node (for instance, for the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the forces caused by the leakage of vibration are in the same phase and mutually opposite directions. Thus, when both of these holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are integrally fastened to a bonding head driving mechanism via the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the leaking energies are mutually cancelled in the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the transmission of vibration to the bonding head driving mechanism is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the shown embodiment, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are disposed in a direction (horizontal direction) that crosses the direction of operation of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (vertical direction). Accordingly, by utilizing the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to fasten the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the transducer holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or to a bonding head driving mechanism, it is possible to increase the dimension in the direction of operation of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and especially to increase the clearance on the underside of the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the direction of operation is oriented downward. As a result, interference with the semiconductor device that constitutes the object of treatment or with device conveying rails, etc. can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiment, the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed at the front and rear ends of the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the transmission of the vibrational energy that leaks out from the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is buffered by the elastic deformation of the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, since the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed as flat plates when viewed from above (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the cross-sectional secondary moment of the thin portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is extremely small, and the thin plate portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> easily undergo elastic deformation, thus being suitable for buffering the vibrational energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured with the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided therein by way of forming through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a round bar material used as a matrix material for the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, working is facilitated in cases where cutting, casting, forging and other working are executed. In the present invention, two through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are bored in the same direction (i.e., the vertical direction). Accordingly, such two through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed in the same direction, and boring by cutting and mold release in the case of casting or forging is efficiently performed. Moreover, the working of the through-holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is accomplished using a tool that is smaller than that used in the working of the flange <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the conventional horn. Accordingly, the ultrasonic horn <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is greatly reduced in size as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the shown embodiment, the portions of the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that are connected by the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are the tip ends of the respective protruded holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the present invention, however, the portions of the respective holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that are connected by the connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are not limited to such tip ends of the protruded holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The substantially same effect can be obtained as long as the portions that are connected are located at positions that differ from the areas where the respective holding portions are connected to (or protrude from) the horn main body. In addition, in the shown embodiment, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are provided at two locations on each side with respect to the axial center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, the holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be provided in three or more locations on each side of the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The holding portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and connecting portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be provided in an asymmetrical fashion in the left-right direction with respect to the horn main body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The embodiment above is described with reference to a wire bonding apparatus. However, the present invention is not limited to a wire bonding apparatus. The present invention is applicable to various types of apparatuses that perform a processing action with a use of load and vibration of a transducer, such as a die bonding apparatus, a flip-chip bonding apparatuses, etc. All of these applications are within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the shape of the transducer is likewise not limited to one shown in the above embodiment, and various types of shapes can be selected in accordance with the use and purpose of the apparatus. </paragraph>
