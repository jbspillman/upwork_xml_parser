<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to agricultural machinery and, more particularly, to a variable straw and chaff distribution arrangement in an agricultural machine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This concerns combine harvesters with rack-type straw walkers or with rotating devices for straw separation behind which is mounted a separate straw chopper which is adjoined by one or more distributing blowers. When using a rotating straw separating device, the straw chopping device can be integrated in it, as described in German patent application DE 19 640 055 A1. In this case a rotating transfer cylinder which conveys the crop into the distributing blower or blowers is used instead of the straw chopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When operating combine harvesters which are equipped inter alia with a blower for the discharge of chopped straw and chaff, it would be advantageous if one can optionally discharge chopped straw mixed with chaff, or depositing the straw unchopped in swaths and distributing only the chaff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For this purpose it is already proposed in international application WO 01/01754 that, for chaff distribution, distributor blowers of which the direction of discharge is optionally variable be stationed in the region between the air sieve device and the straw chopper. Discharge and transverse distribution of the chopped straw is effected by the chopper rotor itself and a discharge housing fitted with guide surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Practical experience has shown that satisfactory distribution of chaff and/or chopped straw is not possible with the known solutions from a given width of the direct-cut attachment without blower assistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention is to provide a variable straw and chaff distribution arrangement that ensures wide distribution of chopped straw and/or chaff with as little expenditure as possible even with wide cutter tables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, there is provided a variable straw and chaff distribution arrangement in an agricultural harvesting having means for separating straw, an air sieve device for separating chaff, and a straw chopping device having an outlet. The arrangement includes an articulated lever combination; means associated with the articulated lever combination for selectively moving the same; at least one rotary blower having a material inlet opening and being connected to the articulated lever combination, said blower being adjustable between at least two different positions by operation of the articulated lever combination; wherein the outlet of the straw chopping device lies in a plane of the material inlet opening of the rotary blower; and guide means for supplying chaff radially to the rotary blower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This aspect is merely illustrative of the innumerable aspects associated with the present invention and should not be deemed as limiting in any manner. This and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes the rear of a combine harvester where the outlet end of straw walkers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, a rotating separating device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is located for separating straw. Below the outlet end is provided a straw chopper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which transfers the chopped straw to the outlet opening to one or more blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are preferably rotary blowers. For energy conservation, in a position A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the outlet end of the straw chopper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> advantageously lies in the same plane as the material inlet opening of the distribution blower <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The details of such an arrangement are shown in German Patent DE 19908111 C1, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> If there are multiple blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, they are preferably arranged adjacent each other for the purpose of wide distribution. When the straw is to be deposited in a swath without passing through the chopper <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a pivotable flap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided for this purpose. The blower or blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be moved by articulated lever combinations <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and servo cylinders <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to two different operative positions A and B in which the blowers lie in planes which are parallel. The significance of this will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An air sieve cleaning device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is located on the combine harvester for separating chaff, and from there the chaff passes to a transfer device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Transfer device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> contains a wall element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which catches the chaff discharged by the air sieve device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and feeds it to the counter-rotating collecting spiral conveyors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which transfer the accumulated chaff to a paddle conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Paddle conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged centrally on the longitudinal axis of the combine between the sidewalls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and conveys the chaff along a channel-like guide <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> centrally between the adjacent blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Between the latter is arranged, facing towards the paddle conveyor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a wedge-shaped guide element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which apportions the stream of chaff centrally to the two blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, radially on the circumference thereof. Via the channel-like guide <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the chaff is conducted to the stream of chopped straw (position A of the blower <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or directly, without admixing straw, into the blower <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (position B of the blower). A position C of the blower <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is a non-working position to which the blower <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be moved to provide access to adjacent machine elements for servicing work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> From the drawings (in particular <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) it can be seen that in position B of the blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> the unchopped straw is deposited in a swath with the chopper drive switched off. Note that at position B the flap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a moved position as compared to position A of the flap shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this moved position B the chaff passes directly for wide distribution to the blower or blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with corresponding displacement of a section of the guide <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In summary, in position A the blower or blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> spread both chaff and chopped straw. In position B the blower or blowers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> spread only chaff and the unchopped straw is deposited in a swath for subsequent harvesting, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and/or described, this has been by way of illustration and the invention should not be limited except as required by the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
