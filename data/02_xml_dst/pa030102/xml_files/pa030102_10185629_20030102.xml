<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for checking a conductive connection between contact points of semiconductor chips formed on a wafer and mating contacts of a test head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Methods are already known by which the electrically conductive connection between the contact pins of a test head and the contact points of the semiconductor chips formed on a wafer can be checked. The test head usually extends over a group of 4 to 64 semiconductor chips. If 64 semiconductor chips are intended to be tested in parallel and each of the semiconductor chips has 60 contact points, it is necessary to check 3840 connections between the contact pins of the test head and the contact points of the semiconductor chips. In conventional methods, a negative voltage is applied to the contact points of the semiconductor chips. Internally, the contact points of the semiconductor chips are connected to a respective protective diode that is forward-biased in the case of a negative voltage at the contact points. The electrically conductive connection between the contact point and the respective contact pin of the test head is ascertained by the current flowing through the protective diodes and the contact points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, if all of the semiconductor chips on a wafer are intended to be tested simultaneously, given 500 to 1000 semiconductor chips on a wafer it is necessary to check 30,000 to 60,000 electrically conductive connections. Otherwise, even functional semiconductor chips do not pass the subsequent tests and are qualified as unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The electrically conductive connection between the contact points of the semiconductor chips and the test pins of the test head cannot readily be checked by using the conventional methods. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method for checking the electrically conductive connection between a large number of contact points of a wafer and the mating contacts of a test head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for checking a conductive connection between contact points of semiconductor chips formed on a wafer and mating contacts of a test head. The method includes steps of: connecting functionally identical contact points of the semiconductor chips in columns using column lines configured in the test head; outputting test signals, which are temporally offset, in rows from the semiconductor chips to the column lines; and detecting and evaluating the test signals, which are temporally offset, from the column lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the method includes steps of: initially, connecting the contact points of the semiconductor chips to shift registers; and connecting the contact points in rows to a respective selection signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the method includes steps of: generating a test bit in each first storage cell of the shift registers by resetting the shift registers; applying a selection signal having a beginning that is temporally offset by rows; and shifting each test bit row by row to outputs of the shift registers, such that when each test bit arrives at the outputs of the shift registers, test signals are output to the column lines using driver circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the method includes steps of: placing the contact points in a high-impedance state if no test signal is present at the contact points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the method includes steps of: connecting the contact points to a test signal line; and applying a test signal to the test signal line, and feeding the test signal in rows, one after another, to the column lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further added feature of the invention, the method includes steps of: using switching elements to connect rows of the contact points of the semiconductor chips to a plurality of test signal lines; and activating the switching elements using a respective selection contact point of the semiconductor chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further additional feature of the invention, the method includes using some of the column lines as the test signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the inventive method, the electrically conductive connection between the contact points and the mating contacts of the test head is tested sequentially row by row. It suffices, therefore, for the test signals running on the column lines to be detected and evaluated. Therefore, only one evaluation circuit per column line is required for carrying out the method. Therefore, the technical outlay for carrying out the method is kept within acceptable limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the contact points of the semiconductor chips are connected to shift registers, that are connected row by row to switching signal lines. By applying switching signals to the switching signal lines, test bits in the shift registers are shifted row by row in a temporally offset manner to the output of the shift registers. Upon the application of a test bit, a test signal is output to the column lines using a driver circuit. In this refinement of the method, only two additional contact points for feeding in the switching signal and for resetting the shift registers are required at the semiconductor chips. This method can then be used to test all of the remaining contact points of the semiconductor chips independently of their function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the contact points are connected to test signal lines via which a test signal is subsequently fed row by row one after the other into the column lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to connect the contact points to the internal test signal line and in order to feed the test signals into the test signal line, at least three contact points are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In return, however, the shift registers assigned to the contact points can be dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a method for checking a conductive connection between contact points, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a plan view of a wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, on which semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed. The semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be, for example, memory modules. The semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have not yet been separated, but rather are still situated in the wafer composite. In the prior art, groups <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are tested using a test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The group <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> covered by the test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is marked in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. In this case, the functionality of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is checked. The groups <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips tested by the known method include from 2&times;2 to 8&times;8 semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Contact between the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is produced by the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The mating contacts are usually needles which, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, bear on contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the prior art, the conductive connection between the contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is checked using a respective protective diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that is connected to a contact point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This diode is forward-biased when a negative external voltage&mdash;U<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is applied. The negative external voltage is applied via an external voltage source <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A current measuring device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is required for detecting the current flowing through the protective diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the contact point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If there is no contact between the contact point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the mating contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, no current flows through the protective diode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the contact point <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the current measuring device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> indicates a current intensity equal to zero (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). The conventional method is suitable only when a small number of connections will be checked between the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If each of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has about 60 contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to check 3840 connections if 64 semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are intended to be checked simultaneously. These are typical numbers for a conventional test. In principle, as many chips as desired can be taken into account on a probe card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> There is a need, however, to test the total number of semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> simultaneously. Since between 500 and 1000 semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are typically formed on a wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to check 30,000 to 60,000 connections between a test head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, all of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are marked as semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that will be tested in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the test head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, functionally identical contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the various semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in each case electrically conductively connected by column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and as a result, the semiconductor chips lying in columns <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are in each case combined to form groups G&lt;0&gt; to G&lt;m&minus;1&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected row by row to selection signal lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are designated by CS&lt;0&gt; to CS&lt;n&minus;1&gt; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Using the selection signal lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the respective row <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made to output a test signal on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The test signals are output to the column lines row by row in a temporally offset manner, so that the test signals running on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be assigned to the individual rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This method makes it possible to check even a large number of connections between the contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> without requiring a disproportionately large outlay, since the contact points <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be rapidly switched through row by row, and the read-out of the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> requires only as many read devices as there are column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a circuit arrangement in the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that can be tested using the method described above. The semiconductor chip illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> suitable for inputting a changeover signal CTEST. By applying the changeover signal to the changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is isolated from a control, address, or command line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> leading to an input amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. At the same time, data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are isolated from data lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> leading to input and output amplifiers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this case, the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are connected to a test signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The test signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in each case includes a test bit memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, downstream of which a shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected. An amplifier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to the output of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The shift registers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must have the same number of storage cells as the number of rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> At the beginning of the test method, a changeover signal is applied to the changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, the switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> changes over the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from the data lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the test signal generators <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is changed over from the control and address line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a switching signal line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the changeover signal triggers a pulse generator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which resets the test signal generators <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the basic state. In this case, the test bit stored in the test bit memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is accepted into a first storage cell of the shift registers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the content of the remaining storage cells of the shift registers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is cleared. The signal for resetting the test signal generators <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is output via a reset line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> from the pulse generator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the test signal generators <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Afterward, a selection signal is fed via the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where it clocks the test signal generators <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As a result, the test bit is shifted step by step through the storage cells of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the test bit appears at the output of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the amplifier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> outputs a test signal to the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the temporal sequence of the test method. At the very top there is an illustration of the temporal profile of the changeover signal CTEST. Illustrated underneath is the temporal profile of the selection signals CS that are assigned to the respective rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and that are fed into the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the selection signal lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. During a start phase <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a selection signal is fed row by row one after the other into the selection signal lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the beginning of the selection signal is delayed by a clock period in each case from row to row. After n&minus;1 clock periods, in the row <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to which the clock signal CS&lt;0&gt; is applied, the test bit is present at the amplifier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so that the test signal is output to the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the temporal profile of the test signals on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is depicted by way of example using two column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B of the test configuration <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. If there is an entirely satisfactory electrical connection between the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in all of the rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a respective test signal TS in the characteristic form must be present on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during a test phase <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A failure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the test signal TS-B indicates, for example, a defective contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the column line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B in the row <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to which the switching signal CS&lt;1&gt; is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It shall be noted that short circuits to a voltage supply can also be discerned from the test signal TS. In this case, the test signal TS would remain continuously at the same voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It shall furthermore be noted that a poor contact between the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the corresponding mating contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can likewise be ascertained by a constant voltage level on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> again illustrates the shift registers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of successive rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By virtue of the row by row delayed beginning of the switching signals CS&lt;0&gt; to CS&lt;3&gt; during the start phase <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the test bit, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> as a logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; (identified by the hatched storage cell of the storage register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is situated in each case in a different storage cell of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in successive rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the test bit appears at the output of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a time characteristic of the respective row <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As a result of the appearance of the test bit at the output of the shift register <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, however, the test signal TS is generated for the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the quality of the electrical connection between the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the mating contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be inferred from the temporal profile of the test signals TS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a modified shift register <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which can be used to generate high-impedance states at the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This shift register <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has two subregisters SR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in which, in each case offset by one storage cell, two test bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; from the selection signal CS are shifted through the storage cells of the shift register <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The outputs of the subregisters SR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to inputs of an amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which switches the output into the high-impedance state (&ldquo;tristate&rdquo;) whenever a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; is present at both inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is extracted and shown as an enlarged inset in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a push-pull output stage formed by an n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a p-channel transistor. The n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to ground at the source end and the p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to V<highlight><subscript>int </subscript></highlight>at the source end. An inverter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is connected upstream of the gate of the p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. During the advancing of the subregisters SR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the shift register <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, first the logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; appears at the output of the shift register SR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which leads to a logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; at the output of the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At the next switching cycle, the subregister SR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> switches to back to &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; now appears at the output of the subregister SR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> then switches to a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; at the output. At all other times, a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; is present at both inputs of the amplifier circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which puts the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the high-impedance state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a further embodiment of a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is likewise provided with a changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition to the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, an address contact point <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and is also present in the exemplary embodiment of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By applying a changeover signal to the changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and also the switching contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the address contact point <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are isolated In from internal data lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and control and address lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this case, the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is changed over to the internal selection signal line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. By contrast, the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the address contact points <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are changed over to an internal test signal line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the address contact points <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be electrically conductively connected internally by the test signal lines <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> by the switches <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which are arranged in the test signal line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and are actuated by the selection signals running on the selection signal line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A test signal fed into one of the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the address contact points <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> therefore appears at all the remaining data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or address contact points <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the temporal sequence of the test method on the basis of the internal circuit in the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. At the beginning, the changeover signal CTEST is applied to the changeover contact point <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As a result, the data contact points <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the address contact points <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are isolated from the internal data lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the control and address lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and are changed over to the test signal line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. A test signal &ldquo;source&rdquo; is subsequently applied to one of the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The selection of the rows <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is performed by the external selection signal lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which are connected to the selection contact point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The switching signals are designated row by row by CS&lt;0&gt; to CS&lt;3&gt; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As a result of the selection signals CS&lt;0&gt; to CS&lt;n&minus;1&gt; being applied row by row in a temporally offset manner, the test signals TS appear in temporal succession on the column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that are not used for feeding in the test signal &ldquo;source&rdquo; The profile of these test signals TS corresponds to the section of the test signal &ldquo;source&rdquo;, which is selected by the selection signals CS&lt;0&gt; to CS&lt;n&minus;1&gt;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the profile of the test signal TS in two column lines <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B. These test signals are designated as TS A and TS B below. The test signal TS A has a failure <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the instant at which the selection signal CS&lt;1&gt; is activated, since, during this time, the test signal source has a switching operation which cannot be found in the test signal TS A. Rather, the test signal TS A remains at a high voltage level. This indicates a short circuit of the assigned contact point <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to a voltage supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A second failure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the test signal TS B at the instant of the activation of the selection signal CS&lt;3&gt; is distinguished by the fact that the test signal TS B remains at zero during this time even though the test signal &ldquo;source&rdquo; has a high voltage level. This indicates a lack of an electrically conductive connection between the data contact point <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the associated mating contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the test head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The method described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> is distinguished by the fact that only a small additional outlay on circuitry is required within the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In particular, there is no need for test signal generators as in the exemplary embodiment illustrated with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Rather, the test signal is fed externally into the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, that requires an additional input through which the test signal &ldquo;source&rdquo; is fed into the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
