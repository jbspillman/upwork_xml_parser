<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An arrangement for measuring the true position of a diaphragm within a diaphragm valve assembly utilizes a thin conductive element disposed in the valve between the diaphragm membrane and the actuator. The conductive element and the valve body are then used as the plates of a parallel plate capacitor, where the measured capacitance will vary as a function of the position of the diaphragm membrane, having a first value when the diaphragm is in the &ldquo;open&rdquo; position and a second value when the diaphragm is in the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; position. Position values between the &ldquo;open&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed&rdquo; positions can also be determined, as well as the presence of different fluids within the valve body when the valve is in the &ldquo;open&rdquo; position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a true position sensor for diaphragm valves and, more particularly, to the inclusion of a conductive member in parallel with the diaphragm to determine the true position of the diaphragm within the valve assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Diaphragm valves are used extensively within the process industry and particularly within the biopharmaceutical process industry to control fluid flow for high purity water, steam and other process fluids. The diaphragm valve is the valve of choice since the design ensures minimal areas for trapped fluid, is freely drainable, and is easily cleaned. The typical design comprises a stainless steel valve body with two wells for the fluid inlet and outlet, similar to a double bowl kitchen sink. The diaphragm is typically a flat elastomer plate that seals against the top edge of the wall between the two wells when the valve is closed, and is lifted away from the top edge of the wall when the valve is open, so as to allow fluid to flow between the wells. An actuator, typically a compressed air operated piston, moves the diaphragm away from the valve body to open the valve, and a spring mechanism forces the diaphragm back against the valve body when the opening force is removed. The diaphragm is typically connected to the actuator with a threaded stud that screws into one end of a rod that is moved by the air-operated piston. The other end of the actuator rod protrudes out the top of the actuator when the valve is open, and retracts into the actuator when the valve is closed, to be used as an external visual indication of the state of the valve. A limit switch assembly is often attached to the top of the actuator and uses a cam rod that threads into the top of the actuator rod and moves with the actuator to activate switches that provide control systems with an electrical indication of the valve position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the critical importance of consistent control over, for example, pharmaceutical manufacturing, many of the diaphragm valves used are computer controlled and monitored. The typical method of monitoring the position of a diaphragm valve is using the limit switch assembly described above. However, a proven problem with the limit switch assemblies is that they indicate the position of the actuator rod, and not necessarily the true position of the diaphragm. Since the diaphragm is connected to the actuator rod by a threaded stud or other suitable mechanical attachment, the diaphragm can be mis-assembled or become separated from the actuator rod with no visible indication of any problem. In this case, the computer control system can command the valve to open and receive feedback from the limit switch that the vale is open, when in fact the diaphragm is still in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another problem with prior art limit switch indicators is that they must periodically be adjusted to correctly indicate the actuator position. This is both an extra step during the manufacturing process, as well as a continuing maintenance issue. Moreover, state-of-the-art limit switch assemblies have no way of indicating the presences of fluid within the valve body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, a variety of needs remain in the art for a diaphragm valve arrangement that can more accurately indicate the proper position and status of the diaphragm within the valve assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The need remaining in the prior art is addressed by the present invention, which relates to a true position sensor for diaphragm valves and, more particularly, to the inclusion of a conductive member in parallel with the diaphragm, where a sensing circuit is coupled to the conductive member and utilizes changes in capacitive readings associated with the conductive member to determine the true position of the diaphragm within the valve assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a thin conductive plate, electrically insulated from its surroundings and with dimensions similar to the diaphragm itself, is placed parallel to the diaphragm and disposed between the diaphragm and the actuator. The thin conductive plate and the actuator body are connected to a circuit that senses both the capacitance and resistance between the plate and the valve body, and uses the change in these electrical quantities as the valve is opened and closed to determine the true position of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the true position sensor of the present invention is that if a fluid is in contact with the diaphragm when the diaphragm is in the open position, the capacitance and resistance will change relative to the open position with no fluid, thus providing an indication that fluid is present in the valve, as well as the type of fluid that is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other and further advantages and embodiments of the present invention will become obvious during the course of the following discussion and by reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. illustrates, in a simplified and exploded view, an exemplary diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including a true position sensor formed in accordance with the present invention. Diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a conventional diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which comprises a flexible lightweight material, such as a Teflon&reg; elastomer. Diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to a diaphragm body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using a suitable attachment arrangement, such as a plurality of assembly bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Shown in phantom within diaphragm body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a pair of reservoirs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, where the position of diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with respect to top surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of reservoirs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will either prevent the flow of liquid from one reservoir to another (the &ldquo;closed position&rdquo;), or permit the flow of liquid (the &ldquo;open&rdquo; position). A diaphragm actuator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used to control the position of diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and, as shown, can be attached to both membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using the same assembly bolts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A section of diaphragm backing material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is used to prevent contact between membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and actuator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a true position sensor is incorporated into the diaphragm valve by using a thin conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> between diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and backing material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed to comprise essentially the same shape and dimensions as diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and will thus easily nest against membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when all of the component pieces are assembled. A first electronic lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coupled, as shown, to conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a second lead <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is similarly coupled to valve body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As will be discussed in detail below in associated with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a sensor circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is coupled to leads <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and is used to sense the resistance and capacitance between thin conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and valve body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Since with the inclusion of the conductive plate the diaphragm valve is now a sandwich of materials (membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), a different capacitance will be measured depending on the true position of member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. That is, when the valve is in the closed position, the layers are in close proximity and have a first measured capacitance. When actuator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then used to move membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the open position, a cavity will be formed between plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, where the air, vacuum or fluid within the cavity will become a second dielectric material and thus change the measured capacitance. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the capacitance measured by sensor circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be used to accurately determine the true position of diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit of the use of conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is that it can be used to detect the presence of fluid within the valve body when the valve is in the open position. Since this measured value will be different from either the known &ldquo;open&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed&rdquo; capacitance values, the measured value can be used as an indication that fluid is within the valve body. The dielectric constant and associated capacitance of each expected fluid can be characterized and used to provide an indication of the fluid present within the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In general, the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by the following relation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C&equals;K&egr;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>A/L,</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> where C is the capacitance measured in farads (F), K is defined as the dielectric constant of the material disposed between the parallel plates (in this case, between conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and valve body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), &egr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is a known proportionality constant (equal to 8.85&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>), A is the parallel plate area measured in square meters, and L is the distance between the plates, as measured in meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a parallel plate area of 0.045 m&times;0.045 m was used (thus, A&equals;0.002 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). Diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was determined to have a thickness of 0.001651 m, with a dielectric constant (for Teflon, in this case) of K&equals;2.1. In the closed state of the diaphragm valve, there is no air present between the parallel plates, only membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the above values can be inserted in the equation to determine a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; valve capacitance value as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>closed</subscript></highlight>&equals;(2.1)(8.85&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>)(0.002)/(0.001651)&equals;22.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>F,</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> or 22.5 picofarads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;open&rdquo; state, membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves away from surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of valve body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus adding a region of air to the gap between the capacitor plates, where this air-related capacitance will add in series with the membrane-related capacitance. Since the dielectric constant of air is approximately equal to 1.0, the capacitance attributed to the presence of air in the valve assembly is determined from the following:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>air</subscript></highlight>&equals;(1.0)(8.85&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>)(0.002)/(0.00381)&equals;4.65&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>F,</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The increase in &ldquo;L&rdquo; to a value of 0.00381 m is attributed to the movement of membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the open position. As is well-known in the art, the equivalent capacitance of capacitors in series is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitors, or:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>1/<highlight><italic>C&equals;</italic></highlight>1/<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;1/<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the &ldquo;open&rdquo; state capacitance for the true position sensor of the present invention can be defined as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>open</subscript></highlight>&equals;1/(1/<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>air</subscript></highlight>&plus;1/<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>closed</subscript></highlight>),</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> where using the particular values defined above,</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>open</subscript></highlight>&equals;1/&lsqb;1(22.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>)&plus;1/(4.65&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>)&rsqb;&equals;3.85&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>F.</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is shown that the total capacitance of the diaphragm valve reduces by approximately 18.65&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>F when the valve moves from its closed to its open position. As discussed below, sensor circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> converts this change in capacitance to a change in frequency, which is counted and compared in an associated microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> contains a diagram of an exemplary sensor circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that may be used to measure and record the capacitance values associated with using conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within the diaphragm valve assembly. For the purposes of discussion, the &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; of conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and valve body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are illustrated as variable capacitor C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where the variation in capacitance, as mentioned above and discussed in detail below, will be used to accurately determine the true position of diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within valve assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown, first lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to a capacitor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within sensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and second lead <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The output from first lead <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes through capacitor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is applied as an input to a conventional timing circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (i.e. a conventional 555 timer). Timing circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is biased by a positive supply voltage V<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>and is also grounded. A resistor network comprising a first resistor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and second resistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is used to provide the appropriate bias value, depending on the expected capacitance within the diaphragm valve. The measured capacitance between plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is passed through timing circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and converted to a pulse stream which is subsequently applied as an input to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> utilizes the pulse input in association with &ldquo;known&rdquo; values for the capacitance associated with the open and closed positions of membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to determine the current, true position of the membrane. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> contains an exemplary plot illustrating the relationship between the measured capacitance and the &ldquo;valve % closed&rdquo; position of a diaphragm membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As seen by reference to this plot, the capacitive value increases as membrane <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> moves from the open to closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations may be made to the preferred embodiment described above without departing from the novel teachings of the present invention. All such modifications and variations are intended to be incorporated herein and within the scope of the present invention, as set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
