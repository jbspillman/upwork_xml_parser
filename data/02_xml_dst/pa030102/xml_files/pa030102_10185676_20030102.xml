<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a parallel resonance whirl antenna, and more particularly, to a parallel resonance antenna (or parallel resonance whishler antenna) capable of uniformly transferring an RF power of very high frequency (VHF) band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In semiconductor device manufacturing processes, processes using plasma are frequently performed. Dry etching, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and sputtering are examples of such processes. In order to enhance the process efficiency, a process using a high density plasma (HDP) having an ion concentration of approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>&minus;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>ions/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is frequently employed at the present. It is well known that this high density plasma can be obtained by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To obtain the aforementioned high density inductively coupled plasma, many applications using the parallel resonance antenna have been tried, but it is not easy to obtain a plasma having a uniform density. Especially, it is much more difficult to obtain such a uniform plasma in the VHF band. The VHF band corresponds to a frequency band between 20 MHz and 300 MHz. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a technical object of the invention to provide a parallel resonance antenna having a new structure and capable of uniformly transferring an RF power of the VHF band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, there is provided a parallel resonance antenna comprising: a whirl antenna having a plurality of antenna units installed two-dimensionally and radially around a central point, each of the antenna units having a ground point at a predetermined position thereof, portions outside the ground points respectively being bent in a same direction, the antenna units having a same size and direction, angles between the antenna units at the central point being all the same; a central conductive line connected to the central point to be normal to the whirl antenna, for being supplied with an RF power; a metal plate installed over and apart from the whirl antenna, the metal plate being connected with end portions of the antenna units, and having a penetration hole through which the central conductive line passes without contacting with the metal plate; and a variable resonance capacitor installed in series between the central conductive line and the metal plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The antenna units are made of copper. Preferably, the bent portions of the antenna units have an arc shape with the central point as a center point, and an inner portion of the ground point has a convex shape in the bent direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, the central conductive line, the antenna units and the metal plate have vacant inner spaces such that a cooling water supplied through the central conductive line is discharged via the antenna unit and the metal plate to an outside, the central conductive line, the antenna units and the metal plate being connected with each other such that the inner spaces thereof communicate with each other, and a cooling water discharge hole being furnished near the penetration hole of the metal plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the antenna unit placed inside the ground point is longer than the antenna unit placed outside the ground point, or the antenna unit placed inside the ground point is the same in length as the antenna unit placed outside the ground point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The metal plate is directly connected with the antenna units, to have an upward convex shape. Also, the antenna may further comprise an external conductive line vertically installed with the whirl antenna at the ends of the antenna units, and the metal plate is connection-supported to have a flat shape. In the latter case, the central conductive line, the antenna units and the metal plate have vacant inner spaces such that a cooling water supplied through the central conductive line is discharged via the antenna unit and the metal plate to an outside, the central conductive line, the antenna units and the metal plate being connected with each other such that the inner spaces thereof communicate with each other, and a cooling water discharge hole being furnished near the penetration hole of the metal plate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a schematic view for illustrating a parallel resonance whirl antenna in accordance with the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an equivalent circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a plurality of antenna units are two-dimensionally and radially installed around a point &ldquo;O&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as a central point). The antenna units have ground points (e, f, g and h) at the same positions, and outer portions of the ground points in the antenna units are bent in the same direction. Accordingly, the antenna units seem to be a whirl on the whole. Reference symbols Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are indicative of corresponding portions of the antenna units, and also indicative of impedance values of the portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An RF power source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the central point &ldquo;O&rdquo; and ends (a, b, c and d) of the antenna units. Between the RF power <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the ends (a, b, c and d) of the antenna units is installed a variable capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is common to the respective antenna units. Between the RF power <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the parallel resonance antenna is installed an impedance matching box (IMB) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for matching impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The RF power supplied from the RF power source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is supplied in parallel to the inner portions Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the ground points via the central point &ldquo;O&rdquo;, and is also supplied in parallel to the outer portions Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the ground points via the variable resonance capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain a uniform plasma density, it is preferable that the antenna units have the same size and shape such that the following conditions, i.e., Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&equals;Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, are satisfied. Also, it is preferable that angles between the antenna units at the central point &ldquo;O&rdquo; are the same such that the antenna units are geometrically symmetric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is desirous that the ground points (a, b, c and d) have a softly curved shape rather than a sharp shape. This is because electric field becomes locally strong at the sharp point, so that it may affect on the uniformity of the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As indicated by the reference symbol &ldquo;A&rdquo;, since the current flow near the ground points has the same direction almost, induced magnetic field at this point is not destroyed but causes the constructive interference. Accordingly, it becomes possible to form plasma having the uniform density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a plan view for illustrating a parallel resonance whirl antenna in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a sectional view taken along the line A-A&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In the drawings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>it is noted that identical reference numerals with those assigned to the elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>represent elements performing the same functions and their repeated descriptions are intentionally omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is installed at a central point &ldquo;O&rdquo; to be normal to the whirl antenna. A metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is installed over and apart from the whirl antenna, and is connected with ends (a, b, c and d) of antenna units to have a convex shape. A penetration hole (h) is formed at the center of the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> such that the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> passes without contacting with the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in the drawings, a variable resonance capacitor (C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is installed such that it is serially connected between the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If an RF power is applied to the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from an RF power source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a part of the RF power flows through ground points (e, f, g and h) via inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points, and a remaining part of the RF power flows through the ground points (e, f, g and h) via the variable resonance capacitor, the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the outer portions (Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the ground points in the order named. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Resonance frequency can be expressed by an equation of (LC)<highlight><superscript>&minus;1/2</superscript></highlight>. Here, inductance L is decided by the geometrical structure of the antenna, to have a fixed value. To this end, in the VHF band having the frequency range of 20 MHz-300 MHz, a small capacitance value permits occurrence of resonance. Accordingly, a vacuum variable capacitor can be used as the variable resonance capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but it is much preferable to use a coaxial capacitor capable of securing a small capacitance of 1-5 pF and finely controlling the capacitance value, as the variable resonance capacitor C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The antenna units can be made of substance having the conductivity, and copper is mainly used. The antenna units have the ground points (e, f, g and h) at the same positions, and the outer portions of the ground points (e, f, g and h) are bent in the same direction. The outer portions of the ground points (e, f, g and h), i.e., the bent portions (Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, ZG, Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) have an arc shape around the central point &ldquo;O&rdquo;, and the inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points have a convex shape along the bent direction, so that the antenna units have a whirl shape on the whole. It is preferable that the inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points of the antenna units are longer than the outer portions (Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the ground points of the antenna units, or the inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points of the antenna units are the same in length as the outer portions (Z<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the ground points of the antenna units. The inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points may have a several times-bent arc shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the antenna units and the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> have vacant inner spaces, and they are connected such that the inner spaces communicate with each other. A cooling water discharge hole <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is furnished near the penetration hole (h) of the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, if cooling water is supplied through the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the cooling water is discharged via the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the antenna units, the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sequentially through the cooling water discharge hole <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to an outside. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a sectional view for illustrating a parallel resonance whirl antenna in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has a difference from those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In other words, external conductive lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are respectively installed at the ends (a, b, c and d) of the respective antenna units such that it is normal to the whirl antenna, and the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected and supported to have a flat shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this case, for the flow of cooling water, the external conductive line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has an vacant inner space, and the external conductive line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is connected with the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the ends (a, b, c and d) of the respective antenna units such that their inner spaces communicate with each other. Accordingly, the cooling water supplied through the central conductive line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is discharged to the outside via the antenna units, the external conductive lines <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As described previously, according to a parallel resonance antenna, the geometrical structure enables to obtain a uniform plasma. Since the antenna has a small inductance, impedance matching is easy even at the VHF band. Also, at the resonance point, since the potential of the inner portions (Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Z<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of the ground points of the antenna units is low, it becomes possible to decrease a non-desired sputtering phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
