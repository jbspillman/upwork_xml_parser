<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an information display device for displaying hierarchical information and a method for displaying the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, since the size of a display screen for displaying information is limited, it is impossible to display all the detailed information. Therefore, in order to provide a user with a larger amount of information, in general, the information is organized into a sequential hierarchy from highly abstract information to detailed information, thereby displaying information efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, in the case of displaying and retrieving such hierarchical information, a user carried out a two-stage operation including a stage of selecting the intended hierarchy and retrieving target information, and a stage of switching the hierarchy and retrieving information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, in a system such as a car navigation system, which is capable of switching a map to be displayed, in the case of setting a destination distant from the present position, a user once displayed a wide-area map so as to set a rough position, then changed the wide-area map into a detailed map belonging to a hierarchy lower than the hierarchy to which the wide-area map belongs, and thereafter set the actual destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, since the operation of switching the hierarchy and the operation of retrieving information were not continuous operations, it was necessary to carry out the operation of retrieving information after switching the hierarchy once, and then switching the hierarchy again. Thus, it took a long time for a user to obtain the desired information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in a car navigation system, when a user sets the destination, in the case where the destination is near the present position, it is possible to set the destination by scrolling a screen with the same scale map displayed on the screen. However, in the case where the destination is distant from the present position, it takes a long time to scroll the screen until the destination appears with the detailed map displayed on the screen. Therefore, the user switched the scale of the map by using a switch for changing the scale of the map so as to display the wide-area map and set the destination roughly, and then switched the scale again so as to display the detailed map and set the actual destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the latter case, in order to determine the destination, the operation by using the switch for changing the hierarchy i.e., the scale of the map) has to be carried out at least twice, and each of the switching operation of the hierarchy and the operation of scrolling the screen is a separate operation. Therefore, there is a problem in that it takes an extremely long time to carry out these operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem, JP 2000-292194 A discloses that the switching of the hierarchy is carried out by pressing a scrolling button for a predetermined time so as to make the scrolling operation be continuous to a screen expanding operation or a screen reducing operation. However, in order to switch the hierarchy, since a user has to keep pressing the scrolling button for a predetermined time, it takes a long time to switch the hierarchy. Thus, there is a problem that the hierarchy cannot be switched for an instant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in an EPG (Electronic Program Guide), a time period, a title, casts of characters, contents etc. of a program were displayed on the display unit. However, since the screen size of the display unit is limited, the amount of information that can be displayed at one time was limited. Therefore, when a user wishes to read program information to be broadcasted in the time period distant from the time period when currently displayed program information is broadcasted, it is necessary to scroll the screen sequentially. Thus, it takes a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in a memory dial system for retrieving a telephone number from a name or designation of an owner of a telephone, a user retrieves a telephone number by sequentially scrolling names or designations in alphabetical order, or retrieves by selecting &ldquo;the initial letter of names or designations&rdquo; by a switch for selecting &ldquo;the initial letter (e.g. &ldquo;A,&rdquo; &ldquo;B,&rdquo; etc.) of name or designation&rdquo; and then scrolling through names or designations in alphabetical order. There is a problem that this way of retrieving is time consuming because the operation of selecting &ldquo;the initial letter of names or designations&rdquo; and the operation of scrolling the name or designation are separate operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing in mind, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a hierarchical information display device capable of easily and rapidly displaying target information required by a user from the hierarchical information and to provide a method for displaying hierarchical information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The information display device of the present invention includes a display capable of displaying at least first information belonging to a first hierarchy and second information belonging to a second hierarchy, and an operation means capable of executing a first scrolling operation for scrolling the display on which the first information belonging to the first hierarchy is displayed, a second scrolling operation for scrolling the display on which the second information belonging to the second hierarchy is displayed, and a hierarchy switching operation for switching between the first information belonging to the first hierarchy and the second information belonging to the second hierarchy to be displayed; wherein the first scrolling operation, the second scrolling operation and the hierarchy switching operation, which are executed by the operation means, are the same kind of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In this specification, the same kind of operation means an operation belonging to the same concept. For example, the operation of inclining the stick is an operation of the concept for moving a stick and the operation of pushing the stick along the axis direction of the stick is also an operation of the concept of moving the stick. Thus, the operation of inclining the stick and the operation of pushing the stick along the axis direction of the stick are common in that both operations are the operation of moving the stick. Therefore, the operation of inclining the stick and the operation of pushing the stick along the axis direction are the same kind of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the scrolling operation herein denotes an operation of moving data displayed on the screen of the display device up/down or right/left, so that new data following the existing data appear on the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The method for displaying information of the present invention includes displaying at least a first information belonging to a first hierarchy on the display, executing a first scrolling operation for scrolling the display on which the first information belonging to the first hierarchy is displayed, executing a hierarchy switching operation for switching the first information belonging to the first hierarchy to a second information belonging to a second hierarchy to be displayed on the display, and executing a second scrolling operation for scrolling the display on which the second information belonging to the second hierarchy is displayed, wherein the first scrolling operation, the second scrolling operation and the hierarchy switching operation are the same kind of operation.</paragraph>

Thus, in the initial state, the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy is displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy showing &ldquo;Aaron,&rdquo; &ldquo;Abel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adam,&rdquo; &ldquo;Andersen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Andromeda&rdquo; whose initial letter of the name or designation is &ldquo;A&rdquo; is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> When the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inclined at an angle that is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle, the control unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the inclining of the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moves the cursor on the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or scrolls the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> When the initial letter of the name or designation that a user wants to display is &ldquo;C,&rdquo; which is apart from &ldquo;A&rdquo; displayed at the present time, if scrolling is carried out with the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy displayed, it takes a long time to reach the initial letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; which the user wants to display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to display the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy, when the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inclined in the direction across the direction expressed by the predetermined tilt angle from the tilt angle that is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle to the tilt angle that is not smaller than the predetermined tilt angle, the angle sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> detects the tilt angle that is not smaller than the predetermined tilt angle as the tilt angle of the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, the hierarchy selection unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which selected the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy stored in the database <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B, selects the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy because the tilt angle detected by the angle sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not smaller than the predetermined tilt angle. Next, the control unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> displays the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy selected by the hierarchy selection unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, when the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inclined at the tilt angle that is not smaller than the predetermined tilt angle, the control unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the inclining of the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moves the cursor on the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or scrolls the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After the user moves the cursor onto &ldquo;C,&rdquo; that is, the initial letter of name or designation that the user wants to display, when the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inclined in the direction across the direction expressed by the predetermined tilt angle from the tilt angle that is not smaller than the predetermined tilt angle to the tilt angle that is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle, the angle sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> detects the tilt angle that is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle as the tilt angle of the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Next, the hierarchy selection unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which selected the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy, selects the memory dial information belonging to the lower level information because the tilt angle detected by the angle sensor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the control unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> displays the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy selected by the hierarchy selection unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, in the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy, the initial letter of the name or designation is &ldquo;C&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;Caesar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Calvin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carroll&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cather,&rdquo; which the user wants to display, are displayed. When the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inclined at a tilt angle that is smaller than the predetermined tilt angle, the control unit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the inclining of the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, moves the cursor on the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or scrolls the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an example in which the cursor moves onto &ldquo;Calvin.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the third embodiment, the information display device includes the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> capable of displaying memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy and memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy, and the operation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> capable of executing a first scrolling operation for scrolling the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on which the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy is displayed, a second scrolling operation for scrolling the display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on which the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy is displayed, and a hierarchy switching operation for switching between the memory dial information belonging to the lower level hierarchy and the memory dial information belonging to the higher level hierarchy to be displayed. The first scrolling operation, the second scrolling operation and the hierarchy switching operation, which are executed by the operation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, are the same operation of inclining the stick <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to display the target memory dial information of a user from the hierarchical program information easily and rapidly. </paragraph>
