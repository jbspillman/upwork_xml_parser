<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a speaker system, and a mobile terminal device and an electronic device including the speaker system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> conventional cellular telephone <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be described. Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 8-275293 discloses a speaker system for vibrating a housing of a cellular phone by a driver directly attached to the housing so as to output a vibration or sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The cellular phone <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an antenna <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is thinner in a rear peripheral portion than the rest thereof, a driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> provided on a rear surface of the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a character display panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided on a front surface of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adjacent to the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An operation of the cellular phone <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be described. When an electric signal is applied to the driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the vibration of the driver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is directly transferred to the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided in the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then, the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is vibrated so as to generate a sound. The sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thinner in the rear peripheral portion than the rest thereof, so as to be easily vibrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The cellular phone <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having such a structure has the following problem. Due to the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the planar size of the character display panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for displaying a phone number or the like is inevitably provided in a small, limited space below the sound board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is conventionally difficult to enlarge the display panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for more conveniently displaying, for example, characters of e-mails or images received through the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A conventional electronic device or a mobile terminal device including the above-described speaker system has the following problem. In these devices, a display panel and a speaker are located separately. Therefore, the position where the image is displayed is different from the position from which the sound is output. This gives the user a sense of unnaturalness. For example, when the electronic device or the mobile terminal device is used as a video telephone, the user has a sense of unnaturalness since the position of the image representing the person on the other end is different from the position from which his/her voice is output. It is more natural and desirable that the position where the image is displayed to the user is the same as the position from which the sound is output to the user. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> according to a first example of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a plan view of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> taken along chain line A-B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes a display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for displaying an image, a transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located so as to allow an image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be viewed through the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) for vibrating the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in accordance with an electric signal so as to output a sound, an elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connected to a peripheral portion of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for supporting the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has a space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably a closed space. The housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a sound hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> acts as an acoustic signal transfer member for transferring the sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The peripheral portion of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported by the elastic member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and thus the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be vibrated by the sound transferred from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the sound hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supports the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an area which is larger than the area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is, for example, a liquid crystal display. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed of glass, an acrylic resin or other materials transmissive with respect to visible light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this example, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a dynamic speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a cup-shaped yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a magnet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> provided on a central part of the yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provided on a top surface of the magnet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> inserted into a magnetic gap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> between the yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connected to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a housing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for supporting a peripheral portion of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided on a central part of the housing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected to the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the sound hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> face each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal is applied to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> inserted into the magnetic gap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Then, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connected to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is vibrated. Thus, a sound is generated. The sound generated by the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the sound hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supported by the elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the peripheral portion thereof is vibrated by the pressure of the sound transferred to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and thus generates a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating measuring results of a sound pressure vs. frequency characteristic of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. The measurement was performed as follows. As the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a dynamic speaker having a speaker diameter of 18 mm was used. As the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a transparent acrylic resin plate having a length of 60 mm, a width of 35 mm and a thickness of 1.7 mm was used. A microphone was placed at a position 0.1 m away from the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. A power of 0.1 W was applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Characteristic curve I in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represents a sound output only from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the absence of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (comparative example). Characteristic curve II represents a sound output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (the present invention). The sound level of characteristic curve II is lower than that of characteristic curve I in a high frequency range of 3 kHz or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The reduction in the sound pressure can be alleviated by adjusting the acoustic capacitance of the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or by adjusting the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the sound pressure level can be raised in the above-described high frequency range by decreasing the acoustic capacitance of the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by reducing the width of the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The sound pressure level can be raised in the above-described high frequency range also by reducing the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The high frequency characteristic of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> can be controlled by forming the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a material having a relatively small specific gravity or by adjusting the thickness of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The width of the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are adjusted in accordance with the bandwidth of the frequency range of the sound to be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the dynamic speaker having the speaker diameter of 18 mm used as the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> was formed of an acrylic film having a thickness of 20 &mgr;m and a weight of about 6 mg. The voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> was formed of a copper wire having a diameter of 0.055 mm and a weight of 25 mg. The diameter of the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> was 8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed of an acrylic resin (length: 60 mm; width: 35 mm; thickness: 1.7 mm) weighed about 4200 mg. The ratio of the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is 4200 mg/(6 mg&plus;25 mg)&equals;about 135. The weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is about 135 times the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the case where the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (comparative example), the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> cannot be substantially vibrated directly by the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As a result, substantially no sound is generated from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in this example, the heavy transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated by a small force, by the following principle. When the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> drives the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and thus the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> applies a pressure to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the pressure applied to the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is transferred to the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> vibrates. Where S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the effective vibration area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the vibration area of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and M<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is M<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/(S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, owing to the effect of the acoustic transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, the effective vibration area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is 98.5 mm and the vibration area of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is 2100 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. (Assuming that the effective radius of vibration of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is from the center of the edge portion to a substantially central position of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the effective radius of vibration of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is 5.6 mm although the apparent diameter of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is 18 mm.) The equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is 4200 mg/(2100 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/98.5 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;9.2 mg. The sum of the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is 6 mg&plus;25 mg&plus;9.2 mg&equals;40.2 mg. Accordingly, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be vibrated by a force which can vibrate an object having a weight of 40.2 mg (total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The weight of the 40.2 mg is about 1.3 times the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (31 mg). Therefore, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated by the force generated in the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> vibrates the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, in which the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having a large area and a great weight is vibrated by a small force as a diaphragm for reproducing an acoustic signal, can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is transmissive with respect to visible light, and therefore can reproduce an acoustic signal without shielding the image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located such that the image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be viewed through the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the position where the image is displayed to the user can be the same as the position from which a sound is output to the user. Owing to such a structure, the user does not have any sense of unnaturalness. The system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> having such a structure may be mounted on an electronic device or a mobile terminal device (e.g., a personal computer, a TV, a game machine, or a cellular phone) including an image or sound signal processing circuit. </paragraph>

Therefore, the acoustic characteristics such as, for example, the reproduction sound volume and the reproduction frequency band can be improved. Especially, the reproduction frequency band in a low frequency range can be expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the first example, the elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for supporting the peripheral portion of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided on a bottom surface of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be provided so as to cover a side surface of the peripheral portion of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, surrounded by the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the elastic member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, preferably maintains a high level of airtightness in order to prevent the sound output from the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> from leaking outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the first example, a dynamic speaker is used as the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> has a space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> between the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is preferably a closed space. The substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> has a sound hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> acts as an acoustic signal transfer member for transferring the sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be vibrated by the sound transferred from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> via the sound hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> supports the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> via the spacer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> has an area which is larger than the area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In this example, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a film which is formed of, for example, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), acrylic resins, or other resin materials transmissive with respect to visible light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has substantially the same structure as that described in the first example, except that the housing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected to the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> such that the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> faces the sound hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal is applied to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> inserted into the magnetic gap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Then, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connected to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is vibrated. Thus, a sound is generated. The sound generated by the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> via the sound hole <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> supported by the spacer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> in the peripheral portion thereof is vibrated by the pressure of the sound transferred to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and thus generates a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating measuring results of a sound pressure vs. frequency characteristic of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The measurement was performed as follows. As the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a dynamic speaker having a speaker diameter of 18 mm was used. As the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, a transparent PET plate having a length of 90 mm, a width of 60 mm and a thickness of 0.1 mm was used. A microphone was placed at a position 0.1 m away from the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. A power of 0.1 W was applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Characteristic curve III in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> represents a sound output only from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the absence of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (comparative example). Characteristic curve IV represents a sound output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (present invention). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the dynamic speaker having the speaker diameter of 18 mm used as the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> was formed of an acrylic film having a thickness of 20 &mgr;m and a weight of about 6 mg. The voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> was formed of a copper wire having a diameter of 0.055 mm and a weight of 25 mg. The diameter of the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> was 8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> formed of PET (length: 90 mm; width: 60 mm; thickness: 0.1 mm) weighed about 700 mg. The ratio of the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is 700 mg/(6 mg&plus;25 mg)&equals;about 22.6 mg. The weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is about 22.6 times the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the case where the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (comparative example), the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> cannot be substantially vibrated directly by the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As a result, substantially no sound is generated from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in this example, the heavy transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated by a small force, by the following principle. When the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> drives the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and thus the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> applies a pressure to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, the pressure applied to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is transferred to the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> vibrates. Where S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the effective vibration area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the vibration area of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and M<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (similarly to the first example), the equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> with respect to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is M<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/(S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, owing to the effect of the acoustic transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, the effective vibration area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is 98.5 mm and the vibration area of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is 5400 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. (As described in the first example, the effective radius of vibration of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is 5.6 mm.) The equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> with respect to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is 700 mg/(5400 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/98.5 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.2 mg. The sum of the total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the equivalent weight of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is 6 mg&plus;25 mg&plus;0.2 mg&equals;31.2 mg. Since the weight of 31.2 mg is substantially the same as total weight of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (31 mg), the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated by the force generated in the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> vibrates the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> via the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Thus, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, in which the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> having a large area and a great weight is vibrated by a small force as a diaphragm for reproducing an acoustic signal, can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> are transmissive with respect to visible light, and therefore an acoustic signal can be reproduced without the image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being shielded. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is located such that the image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be viewed through the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the position where the image is displayed to the user can be the same as the position from which a sound is output to the user. Owing to such a structure, the user does not have any sense of unnaturalness. The system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> having such a structure may be mounted on an electronic device or a mobile terminal device (e.g., a personal computer, a TV, a game machine, or a cellular phone) including an image or sound signal processing circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is provided between the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Since the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> protects the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> against external impacts, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be thinner. Therefore, the acoustic characteristics such as, for example, the reproduction sound volume and the reproduction frequency band can be improved. Especially, the reproduction frequency band in a low frequency range can be expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> During the production process of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may be formed in advance between the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. In this case, precise positioning between the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>/display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not necessary. This simplifies the process for mounting the speaker system <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> on an electronic device or a mobile terminal device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, surrounded by the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, the spacer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, preferably maintains a high level of airtightness in order to prevent the sound output from the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> from leaking outside. This can be realized by, for example, bonding the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, the spacer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the second example, a dynamic speaker is used as the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> A speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> according to a fourth example of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> is a plan view of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> taken along chain line I-J shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> basically has the structure of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in the third example with a plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes a display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for displaying an image, a transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> located so as to allow an image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to be viewed through the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> each having a diaphragm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) for vibrating the diaphragm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in accordance with an electric signal so as to output a sound, acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, and a housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for supporting the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively connected to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> has a space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> between the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is preferably a closed space. The housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> via an opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereof and to the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> via an opening <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> thereof. The acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> each act as an acoustic signal transfer member for transferring the sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is supported by the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in a peripheral portion thereof, and can be vibrated by the sound transferred from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has an area which is larger than the area of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this example, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is a film which is formed of, for example, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or other resin materials transmissive with respect to visible light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> in the fourth example is different from the speaker system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in the third example in that the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes the plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the plurality of acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is entirely a film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> has the same structure as that of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described in the third example. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> also operates in the same manner as the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described in the third example. The acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are communicated with the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> at different positions from each other. The sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> via the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is vibrated by the pressure of the sound transferred to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> so as to generate a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> When, for example, an electric signal representing information for a right channel is input to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an electric signal representing information for a left channel is input to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the sound for the right channel is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> via the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the sound for the left channel is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> via the opening <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is vibrated by a synthesis sound pressure for the right and left channels. In this manner, a stereo reproduction is realized. Especially because the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is a film in this example, portions of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which are immediately facing the openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are vibrated by a sound of a high frequency range which has a short wavelength and narrow directivity. The entire transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is vibrated by a sound of a low frequency range which has a long wavelength and wide directivity. Even though the sound for the right channel and the sound for the left channel are synthesized in the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, the sound of the high frequency range which contributes to the expansion of the sound image is output from separate positions of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Thus, an effective stereo reproduction is realized by one transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In the case where the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> is mounted on a mobile terminal device including a relatively large display panel such as, for example, a PDA (personal digital assistant), the openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the acoustic pipes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can be located on both ends of the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, i.e., away from each other by a relatively large distance. Therefore, a sound image of the sound output from the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is enlarged, and thus a more effective stereo reproduction is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes two electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in this example, but may include three or more electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers. Each of the plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers is connected to an acoustic pipe. Each acoustic pipe is communicated to the space <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> at different positions. In this case, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is vibrated by the plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers, and therefore a sound of a higher volume is output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may have an opening at top, bottom, right and left positions thereof. In this case, for example, the openings on the top and bottom positions may be used to transfer the sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer based on an electric signal representing audio information for one of multiple channels. Thus, a more realistic sound can be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> When the electric signal is a monaural signal, the same electric signal may be input to the plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers. Alternatively, the monaural signal may be input to one of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> An electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> may be used instead of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> includes a cup-shaped yoke <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> having a spindle section <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> along a periphery thereof, a magnet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> provided on a central part of the yoke <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provided on a top surface of the magnet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> inserted into a magnetic gap <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> between the yoke <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connected to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, housings <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> for supporting a peripheral portion of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and a suspension <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> connected to a peripheral portion of the yoke <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface of the housing <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> is connected to the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> includes the yoke <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the magnet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Since the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is supported by the suspension <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can be vibrated so as to generate a mechanical vibration simultaneously with, or independent from, the acoustic signal reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> outputs a sound from the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as described in the first example with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for generating a mechanical vibration will be described. A vibration function of an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer is disclosed by, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 10-215499 and will not be described in detail here. When an electric signal is applied to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a force is generated in the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction to the force generated in the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is supported by the housing <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> via the suspension <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. A mechanical resonating system includes the mass of the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the stiffness of the suspension <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. When the frequency of the electric signal applied to the voice coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> substantially matches the resonating frequency of the mechanical resonating system, the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> largely vibrates. This vibration is transferred to the housing <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> via the suspension <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Since the housing <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is mechanically coupled to the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the housing <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the vibration of the magnetic circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is transferred to the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so as to vibrate the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As described above, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> has two functions of acoustic signal reproduction and generation of a mechanical vibration. For example, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> may be used for a mobile terminal device having a signal receiving function, for example, a cellular phone. In this case, the mobile terminal device has both a function of a speaker of notifying the user of the signal reception by an acoustic signal of a melody or the like, and a function of a vibrator of notifying the user of the signal reception by a vibration transferred to the body of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> When an electronic device including the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> including the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is used to play a game or the like, the combination of a realistic sound effect and a vibration transferred to the user raise the level of excitement of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Even when the electric signal is a monaural signal, the user feels the vibration in addition to hearing the acoustic signal reproduced from the same plane of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> may be used instead of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>.

The acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A substrate <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, which is provided instead of the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, has sound holes <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> When, for example, an electric signal representing information for a right channel is input to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an electric signal representing information for a left channel is input to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the sound for the right channel is transferred from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the sound for the left channel is transferred from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the space <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is vibrated by a synthesis sound pressure for the right and left channels. In this manner, a stereo reproduction is realized. Especially because the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is a film in this example, portions of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> which are immediately facing the openings <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> are vibrated by a sound of a high frequency range which has a short wavelength and narrow directivity. The entire transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is vibrated by a sound of a low frequency range which has a long wavelength and wide directivity. Even though the sound for the right channel and the sound for the left channel are synthesized in the space <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the sound of the high frequency range which contributes to the expansion of the sound image is output from separate positions of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Thus, an effective stereo reproduction is realized by one transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the case where the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at a position off the center of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be efficiently provided in an empty space in the housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The empty space in the housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can also be efficiently formed in the housing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> in this example includes two electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and one acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> A mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> according to a fifth example of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a partially cut plan view of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In this example, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is described as a cellular phone. However, the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is not limited to a cellular phone. The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a PDA, a beeper, or a wristwatch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> includes a first housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> including, for example, a built-in signal receiving circuit, a signal receiving antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> attached to the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and a speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. The first housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an electric circuit, a connector and the like (not shown) built therein. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is a modification example of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> described in the third example. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> includes a display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> instead of the display panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> included in the speaker system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is, for example, a liquid crystal display, and has a function similar to that of the display <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>, the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and a peripheral portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are supported by the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> includes a space <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> between the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> is preferably a closed space. The display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is supported by the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> such that an image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> can be viewed from outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The operation of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as that of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> described in the third example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal representing a received sound (for example, the voice of a caller) is applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), the received sound is reproduced from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> acts as a receiver, which is a speaker for reproducing the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal representing, for example, a call arrival sound, music, voice or a sound effect for a game is applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the call arrival sound, the music, the voice or the sound effect for the game is reproduced from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the case where the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is a telephone having a function of, for example, a video telephone, an image signal is applied to the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> so as to display the face of a person on the other end in the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and concurrently the voice of the person represented by a voice signal is reproduced from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> As in the first example, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can sufficiently vibrate the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having a large area and a great weight by a small force. Accordingly, even when the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> has a large area and thus the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also has a large area, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated. In addition, the surface from which the sound is output is the same as the surface on which the image is displayed. Therefore, the position where the image is displayed to the user can be the same as the position from which the sound is output to the user. Thus, a more realistic acoustic signal reproduction is realized. Such a mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is optimum for simultaneously reproducing the sound and the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> When the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> operates as a diaphragm of the receiver for reproducing a received sound, the received sound is reproduced from the entire surface of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Therefore, at whichever position of the large transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> the user&apos;s ear may contact, the user can hear the sound. Since it is not necessary to put the user&apos;s ear at a particular position, the user&apos;s ear is never deviated from the sound source. Such a mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> allows especially an aged user to easily hear the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> will be further described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> includes a signal output section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for outputting an electric signal based on a wireless signal received by the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The signal output section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and an electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal externally sent (for example, sent from a relay station for cellular phones). The wireless signal represents a call arrival sound, a received sound, music, an image or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> When the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal representing a call arrival sound, the wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> outputs a call arrival sound signal representing the call arrival sound so as to notify the user of a call arrival. The call arrival sound signal is amplified by the electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> reproduces the call arrival sound. The call arrival sound signal may be a signal representing a preset call sound or an audio signal obtained by data distribution or the like. When the user learns of the call arrival and puts the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> into a call receivable state, the wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> outputs a received sound signal representing a received sound (for example, the voice of the caller). The received sound signal is amplified by the electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> reproduces the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In this case, the user can select one of two methods of using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>: (i) a method of putting his/her ear into contact with the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as in a general cellular phone; and (ii) a method of using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> in a hands free mode, from a position away from the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>. In the hands free mode, the amplification ratio of the electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is increased so as to raise the reproduction sound volume. Also in the hands free mode, when both of the telephones (telephones of the caller and the user) include a camera so as to provide a function of a video telephone, the caller and the user can talk while seeing each other&apos;s face on the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> based on the image signal. The image signal represents a moving picture, a still picture, character information or other images. When the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal representing an image and the wireless signal output section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> outputs an image signal to the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the image is displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the case where the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is used in a hands free mode, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker. Use of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> as the loudspeaker realizes, for example, reproduction of a music signal downloaded through the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The function of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> of simultaneously reproducing an image and a sound is effective for, for example, reproducing a promotional video of a music tune or using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> as a game machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> may include the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in the first example instead of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal representing, for example, a call arrival sound, music, voice or a sound effect for a game is applied to at least one of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the call arrival sound, the music, the voice or the sound effect for the game is reproduced from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. In this case, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> When the same electric signal is applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the sound pressure level can be improved as compared to the sound pressure level obtained by a speaker system including one electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer, with a given power consumption. As described above, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> can reproduce audio signals for a plurality of channels. For, for example, reproducing audio signals representing music in stereo, a music signal for the right channel is applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a music signal for the left channel is applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the music is reproduced in stereo from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the case where the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> is a telephone having a function of, for example, a video telephone, an image signal is applied to the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> so as to display the face of a person on the other end in the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and concurrently the voice of the person represented by a voice signal is reproduced from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> As in the first example, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can sufficiently vibrate the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> having a large area and a great weight by a small force. Accordingly, even when the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> has a large area and thus the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> also has a large area, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently vibrated. In addition, the surface from which the sound is output is the same as the surface on which the image is displayed. Therefore, the position where the image is displayed to the user can be the same as the position from which the sound is output to the user. Thus, a more realistic acoustic signal reproduction is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The operation of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> will be further described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> includes a signal output section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for outputting an electric signal based on a wireless signal received by the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The signal output section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes a wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and electric signal amplification sections <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal externally sent (for example, sent from a relay station for cellular phones). The wireless signal represents a call arrival sound, a received sound, music, an image or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> When the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal representing a call arrival sound, the wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> outputs a call arrival sound signal representing the call arrival sound so as to notify the user of a call arrival. The call arrival sound signal is amplified by at least one of the electric signal amplification sections <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and applied to at least one of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> reproduces the call arrival sound. The call arrival sound signal may be a signal representing a preset call sound or an audio signal obtained by data distribution or the like. When the call arrival sound signal is input in the form of stereo audio signals, the audio signal for the right channel is amplified by the electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the audio signal for the left channel is amplified by the electric signal amplification section <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and applied to the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> reproduces a stereo sound. When the user learns of the call arrival and puts the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> into a call receivable state, the wireless signal processing section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> outputs a received sound signal representing a received sound (for example, the voice of the caller). The received sound signal is amplified by at least one of the electric signal amplification sections <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and applied to at least one of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> reproduces the received sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In this case, the user can select one of two methods of using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>: (i) a method of putting his/her ear into contact with the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> as in a general cellular phone: and (ii) a method of using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> in a hands free mode, from a position away from the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>. In the hands free mode, the amplification ratio of the electric signal amplification sections <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is increased so as to raise the reproduction sound volume. Also in the hands free mode, when both of the telephones (telephones of the caller and the user) include a camera so as to provide a function of a video telephone, the caller and the user can talk while seeing each other&apos;s face on the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> based on the image signal. The image signal represents a moving picture, a still picture, character information or other images. When the antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a wireless signal representing an image and the signal output section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> outputs an image signal to the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the image is displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the case where the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> is used in a hands free mode, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> acts as a loudspeaker. Use of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> as the loudspeaker realizes, for example, reproduction of a music signal downloaded through the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The function of the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> of simultaneously reproducing an image and a sound is effective for, for example, reproducing a promotional video of a music tune or using the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> as a game machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight>, the electric signal represents at least one of a received sound, a call arrival sound, and audio information for a plurality of channels. When the electric signal represents at least one of the received sound and the call arrival sound, the electric signal is input to the plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the electric signal represents the audio information for the plurality of channels, an electric signal representing audio information for each of the plurality of channels is input to a respective one of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> may include the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> in the fourth example instead of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> includes a first housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a second housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a signal receiving antenna <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> attached to the second housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and a speaker system <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> is a modification example of the speaker system <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> described in the third example. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> includes an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> instead of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the speaker system <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, the display panel <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> are supported by the second housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The second housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a sound hole <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>. The second housing <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes an electric circuit, a connector and the like (not shown) built therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will be described. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, an annular second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> provided so as to surround the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, a yoke <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> for connecting the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, a first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> provided in a first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> between the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, a second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> provided in a second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> between the second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, a first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight>, a second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> provided oppositely to the diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> with respect to the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, a disc-shaped first magnetic plate <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> provided between the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> and the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, an annular second magnetic plate <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> provided between the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, a first housing <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> for supporting the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight>, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and the second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, and a second housing <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> for covering the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> provided oppositely to the diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> with respect to the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> An exemplary operation of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> When an electric signal is applied to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight>. Then, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> connected to the first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> is vibrated so as to generate a sound. Similarly, when an electric signal is applied to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, a driving force is generated in the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>. Then, the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> connected to the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> is vibrated so as to generate a sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> The sound output from the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> via the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and thus the sound is output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The sound output from the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is transferred outside the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> via the sound hole <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> inserted into the first magnetic gap <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is driven using the first magnet <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> inserted into the second magnetic gap <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is driven using the second magnet <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>. Since the first and second magnets <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> are driven by different magnets, the driving force generated in each of the first and second voice coils <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> can be increased. Thus, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can generate a sound having a large volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The first voice coil <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> and the second voice coil <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> are independently drivable from each other. A call arrival sound or a received sound which is output from the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> via the acoustic pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Thus, the call arrival sound or the received sound is output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be folded with respect to each other along a connection section <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is open (i.e., when the housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are not folded with respect to each other), the user can clearly hear the call arrival sound output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. By contrast, when the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is closed (i.e., when the housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the second housing <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are folded with respect to each other), the call arrival sound output from the transparent panel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is shielded by the first housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, making it difficult for the user to hear the call arrival sound. In order to avoid this, the call arrival sound is output from the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> when the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> is closed. Thus, the user can clearly hear the call arrival sound. In a conventional foldable mobile terminal device, it is desired that two electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers are provided: one for both outputting a sound outside in a closed state, and the other for realizing a dialog in an open state. This enlarges the space required for the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers. In the mobile terminal device <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, one electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer is usable both for outputting a sound outside in a closed state and realizing a dialog in an open state. This reduces the space for the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer. </paragraph>

Namely, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is used both as a touch panel and a transparent panel for acoustic signal reproduction. The electronic device including the touch panel has a space between the display panel and the touch panel. The sound output from the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer is transferred to the space, and thus the sound is output from the touch panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> An electronic device, including a panel which is usable both as the touch panel and the transparent panel for acoustic signal reproduction, reproduces a sound from the touch panel. The component for acoustic signal reproduction can be simplified. In such an electronic device, a speaker system according to the present invention can be easily produced. The touch panel is transparent and transmissive with respect to visible light. Therefore, the touch panel does not shield an image displayed in the display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> In this example, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is also used as a static capacitance system touch panel. Alternatively, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may also be used as an optical system touch panel. The optical system touch panel includes a plurality of light emitting elements and a plurality of light receiving elements. The optical system touch panel detects that the light emitted by one of light emitting elements is shielded before reaching the corresponding light receiving element, and thus detects the position of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> which is in contact with the contact member. Still alternatively, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be, for example, an electro magnetic induction type system panel or an ultrasonic system touch panel. The electromagnetic induction system touch panel uses a loop antenna to detect the position of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> which is in contact with a contact member including a resonating circuit. The ultrasonic system touch panel uses a vibration sensor to detect the position of the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> which is in contact with a contact member including an ultrasonic diaphragm. Regardless of the system, substantially the same effect is provided. In any of these systems, one panel can be used both as a touch panel and a vibration panel. The method for detecting the position in the transparent panel <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> using the touch panel is not limited to the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> described in the third example may be used in the speaker system <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Based on the calculated electric resistance, the control section <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> calculates the coordinate value of the position at which the transparent electrodes <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> contact each other. The control section <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> causes the electronic device <highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight> to operate with a prescribed function in accordance with the content of the menu icon <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> corresponding to the detected coordinate value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In this example, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> acts as a resistance film system touch panel. In other words, the transparent panel <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> acts both as a touch panel and as a transparent panel for acoustic signal reproduction. The acoustic pipe is provided in connection with the space <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, and a sound output from an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sound from the touch panel can be easily output. In a structure of using a resistance film system touch panel, a space is necessarily and easily provided between the touch panel and the display panel or the substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is a modification example of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. In this example, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is rectangular. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the shorter side of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is shown. The housing <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> covers a top surface and side surfaces of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and forms an empty space <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> has a slit opening <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is communicated with the sound hole <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> operates in substantially the same manner as the speaker system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> described in the first example including the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Specifically, a sound which is output from the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is transferred to the space <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> via the empty space <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, the opening <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and the sound hole <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. The transparent panel <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is vibrated by the pressure of the sound transferred to the space <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> so as to generate a sound. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> may further include an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> includes substantially the same components as those of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. When including the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> operates in substantially the same manner as the speaker system <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> described in the fourth example. The speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> can provide a stereo reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The opening <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> extends in a direction vertical to a direction in which the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> vibrates. The sound hole <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, which is in communication with the opening <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, is formed in a direction parallel to a direction in which display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> extends. Owing to such a structure, the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> can be provided on the same plane as, and adjacent to, the display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, which can provide the speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> with a decreased thickness. The sound output from the diaphragm <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is transferred parallel to the display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. The electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> can also be provided in the same plane as, and adjacent to, the display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when including the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, the speaker system <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> can be also thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The transparent panel <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is provided such that an image displayed in the display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> is viewed through the display panel <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the personal computer <highlight><bold>2600</bold></highlight>, the position at which an image is displayed to the user is the same as the position from which a sound is output to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> A speaker system according to the present invention is easily applicable to an electronic device including a display panel, for example, a TV, a game machine, or a car navigation system. The transparent panel may act only as a diaphragm for outputting a sound, or may act both as a diaphragm and a touch panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In the case where the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer has a function of a mechanical vibration function as well as an acoustic signal reproduction function, the two functions can be separately used for specific purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a speaker system including a transparent panel provided such that an image displayed in a display panel is viewed through the transparent panel. The transparent panel can be vibrated. Owing to such a structure, the position at which the image is displayed to the user can be the same as the position from which a sound is output to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a sound output from a diaphragm having a smaller area is transferred to a space, and a transparent panel having a larger area is vibrated by the sound transferred to the space. Owing to such a structure, even when the transparent panel is relatively heavy, the transparent panel can be vibrated and a sound having a sufficient volume can be output by a small force which is sufficient to vibrate a diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a substrate is provided between the display panel and the transparent panel. Since the substrate protects the display panel against external impacts, the transparent panel can be formed to be thinner, which improves the acoustic characteristics of the transparent panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, an acoustic pipe is provided as an acoustic signal transfer member for transferring a sound output from an electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer to the space. Owing to such a structure, the freedom of locating the speaker system in an electronic device or a mobile terminal device including the speaker is increased. Since it is not necessary that the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer be provided adjacent to the display panel, the space in which the display panel can be provided can be enlarged, which increases the size of the display panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In the case where a speaker system according to the present invention is mounted on a mobile terminal device (for example, a cellular phone), the transparent panel can operate as a diaphragm of a receiver for reproducing a received sound. Since the received sound is reproduced from the entire surface of the transparent panel, the user can hear the received sound wherever the user&apos;s ear may be located on the transparent panel having a relatively large area. This eliminates the necessity of putting the position of the user&apos;s ear at one particular position of the transparent panel. The user&apos;s ear is never deviated from the sound source. Such a mobile terminal device allows especially an aged user to easily hear the received sound. When the level of the electric signal applied to the speaker system is raised, the speaker system acts as a loudspeaker for outputting a sound having a large volume even when separated from the main body of the mobile terminal device. In this case, the user can use the mobile terminal device as a video phone, by which the user can perform a dialog with a person on the other end while viewing an image on a screen. Since the position at which the image is displayed to the user is the same as the position from which the sound is output to the user, a realistic sound reproduction is provided. Such a mobile terminal device is optimum for simultaneously reproducing a sound and an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In the case where the speaker system according to the present invention includes a plurality of electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducers, multiple channel reproduction, for example, a stereo reproduction, is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> In the case where the electric-mechanical-acoustic-transducer has a mechanical vibration function as well as an acoustic signal reproduction function, the speaker system can simultaneously perform the two functions of acoustic signal reproduction and mechanical vibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In an electric device including a touch panel, the touch panel can also be used as a transparent panel of the speaker system according to the present invention. In this case, the speaker system according to the present invention can be easily produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. </paragraph>
