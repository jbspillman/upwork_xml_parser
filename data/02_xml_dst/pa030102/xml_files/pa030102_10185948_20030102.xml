<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a flexible heating or cooling system for heating, or cooling, a contained item or product. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various types of self-heating/self-cooling containers are known in the art for heating or cooling the contents held within the container to a desired temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In one type of self-heating/self-cooling containers, the containers function solely as receptacles into which the final user may place any item they desire to heat/cool. Some of these receptacles are designed with a certain product in mind, such as a standard size can of food or beverage. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,425,900 describes a package that is readily transportable and adapted to receive any standard can suitable for the size of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Several examples of flexible self-heating/self-cooling containers exist in the literature. The inventions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,707 uses an electrolytic-solvent to activate exothermic-chemical pad or powder. The exothermic-chemical pad is enclosed within an absorbent envelope and the electrolytic-solvent is contained within a bag. It also discloses a pouch for foodstuff. U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,707 discloses an invention that consists of a thermal insulated outer barrier layer in which is contained the exothermic-chemical pad, the electrolytic solvent containing bag, and the pouch for foodstuff. The solvent bag is affixed to a board material, which provides a rigid structure for the proper functioning of a tear filament pull-tab mechanism or a means for rupturing the solvent bag. To properly work, this package must have a specific orientation and cannot be moved about once activated because of the potential to spill the activating fluid, i.e., it is not self-contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,685,507 describes as one embodiment a multi-walled container unit fabricated of plastic film, which is comprised of three flexible bags of plastic film. An outer bag within which is suspended an inner bag of shorter length. The outer bag also has disposed in its bottom a charge of chemical and a small plastic bag, which has sealed therein a charge of a second chemical. The bulk of the heating element and thus the chemical reaction is located at the bottom of the package. This is undesirable because the heating element is not disposed adjacent and along the product to be heated or cooled. Because of this, it is suggested that the heating or cooling is inefficient. Also, the patents suggests that shaking or inverting the package would to disperse the contacted chemicals throughout the container and into the annular mixing space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,242 describes a device for changing the temperature of material placed therein by a user. The device comprises an inner flexible cylindrical member having an open end for receiving and changing the temperature of an item such as a can of soda or food and a temperature changing element within the walls of the cylindrical member. However, this device does not permit the activation of the heating or cooling element while the item to be heated or cooled is within the cylindrical member without damaging the item, i.e., no offset activation point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,991 describes a thermal packaging unit for heating a biocompatible implant that is self-contained in that the elements used for heating the biocompatible device are located within the thermal packaging unit. To provide means for heating the biocompatible implant, the thermal packaging unit includes a first compartment that is operable to contain calcium chloride, that defines a storage area for receiving the biocompatible implant, and a second compartment disposed within the first compartment that is operable to contain water. When the wall of the second compartment is ruptured, as by gently squeezing the thermal packaging unit, water from the second compartment is able to combine with the calcium chloride in the first compartment in an exothermic reaction. Again, this device does not include an offset activation point that will permit activation of the temperature changing element without damaging the item to be heated or cooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> None of these patents address the issue of providing a solid-liquid-, or liquid liquid-interaction, or crystallization of a supercooled solid-based thermal regulation source in a flexible container while providing for an activation method that will prevent the accidental damage of the product contained within the package. Also, none of these patents address the problem of maintaining the integrity of the structure containing the reactive chemistry. Further, the system is characterized by providing optimal heat transfer by having the heat source adjacent to the item to be heated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a flexible heating/cooling system comprising an enclosed package containing a product and at least two flexible temperature changing elements. Each flexible temperature changing elements comprises a first chamber and a second chamber disposed proximate to the first chamber. At least a portion of the at least two flexible temperature changing elements is disposed proximate to the product so that thermal energy from the at least two flexible temperature changing elements heats or cools the product.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a heating, or cooling, temperature changing package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for use with an item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be heated, or cooled, with an exothermic, or endothermic, reaction upon activation. The disclosure will focus on heating an item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an exothermic chemical reaction. Exemplary, but non-limiting, exothermic chemical reactions, include water reacting with quicklime (Calcium Oxide), calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and/or anhydrous zeolite formations, electrochemical systems (e.g., a magnesium/magnesium alloy coupled with an electrolyte solution), crystallization of a super-cooled saturated salt solution, and combinations thereof. &ldquo;Activation&rdquo;, as used herein, is a method or action taken to initiate an exothermic, or endothermic, chemical reaction system. Activation may be characterized by the application of a linear force, torsional bending, removal of a separation, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an integrated self-heating package is formed from a multiple layered structure. &ldquo;Integrated&rdquo;, as used herein, means that a temperature changing element is part of the packaging rather than a separate unit located within the packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A detail a preferred embodiment of a self-heating package (package) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can include outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be comprised of a paper board material, flexible film material (e.g., foil, paper, or plastic), metallized plastic or paper, metallized films, preferably with an internal sealing layer (i.e., Surlyn&reg; or LDPE), any other heat sealable polymeric film, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are manufactured from a 5 mil (127 &mgr;m) paper/foil/LDPE laminate film cut to a 5&frac12;-inch&times;14-inch (13.97 cm&times;35.56 cm) sheet. Preferably, two side edges <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are sealed to form a pouch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, wherein opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is defined by two top edges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This film can be folded, as is known to one of skill in the art, with a single fold, or with a &ldquo;W&rdquo; fold, to form a gusseted bottom <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Alternatively, as shown in FIG.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, two bottom edges of outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be sealed together to enclose, or form, a bottom of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Additionally, outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, when connected to form package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, can form a pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> capable of holding item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be heated, or cooled. Opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can permit placement of item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Once item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be thermally, ultrasonically, adhesively, or physically sealed (with a clamp, tie, or zipper closure) across the top edge <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can provide a barrier for item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contained within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As would be known to a skilled artisan, outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> should be capable of withstanding the temperatures developed by a chemical reaction within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Additionally, upon opening package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a formed plastic or wire ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A, can maintain the pouch in an open, cup-like form. This can be surprisingly beneficial by adding structure to a collapsible package containing a liquid item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can also include a temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can include an exothermic, or endothermic, system that provides heating, or cooling, for item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contained within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be fixably attached to the inner surface of outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed to be integral with outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (i.e., temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> share a common wall). Preferably, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a self-contained, two chamber system comprising a first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a second chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> separated by a frangible seal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Frangible seal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be ruptured by pressure applied to one or more of first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and second chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. First chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can contain a first material and second chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may contain a second material. &ldquo;Self-contained temperature changing element&rdquo;, as used herein, means a heating or cooling element wherein all materials and the resultant reaction are held within an enclosed boundary, for instance, a package. Thus, the materials incorporated into temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> cannot access pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereby preventing intermixing with item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As one of skill in the art would realize, other types of temperature changing elements may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably includes an offset activation point. An &ldquo;offset activation point&rdquo; means a point or mechanism displaced away from item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that when temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is activated, item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not damaged or destroyed. As one of skill in the art would appreciate, an offset activation point can be a separate device or, as in the preferred embodiment, can be integral with temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Generally, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is activated at the first chamber of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (i.e., the first chamber of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is the activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can include heating and/or cooling by chemical reactions, not limited to, solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, anhydrous, heat of solution, crystallization, electro-chemical, zeolite-liquid, heat of neutralization, and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may include a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid heating and/or cooling systems, such as anhydrous reaction systems, heat of solution systems, zeolite systems, and electrochemical systems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;solid-liquid heating/cooling system&rdquo; means any exothermic, or endothermic, change that occurs during the combination, or mixing, of two or more components, where at least one system component is liquid (e.g., water) and one component is solid (e.g., anhydrous salts). A &ldquo;liquid-liquid heating and/or cooling system&rdquo; means any exothermic, or endothermic, change that occurs during the combination, or mixing, of two or more components, where two or more system components are liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in preferred embodiments, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can comprise a self-enclosed system having a substantially moisture impermeable outer layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. Moisture impermeable outer layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> can be flexible or rigid. For example, the water impermeable outer layer may be a metallized film, foil laminate film, MYLAR&trade;, a formed metal sheet, or any other water and/or moisture impermeable material. The water moisture impermeable outer layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> may also include a material having optimized thermal conductive parameters such as a metallized foil that can permit increased thermal diffusivity and/or conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The embodiments as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 16</cross-reference> show a temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, including a solid-liquid and/or liquid-liquid heating/cooling system, including multiple components of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> housed in adjacent chambers separated by a rupturable barrier or seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, for example, a frangible seal. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can include a water impermeable layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> formed into a pouch having two or more chambers that separately house solid and/or liquid materials of the system prior to activation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be permanently sealed about its periphery <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to include a first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and a second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. Upon compression of one or more chambers of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, rupturable seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> may rupture allowing a liquid material(s) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> (e.g., water) to flow into contact with a solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> (e.g., anhydrous salt, electro-chemical alloys) of a solid-liquid system and the other liquid material(s) in a liquid-liquid heating system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, both chambers may be interchanged. Applying pressure to one or more of the chambers such as squeezing, pressing, kneading, etc. can rupture the frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> facilitating mixing of the materials contained within of the first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> thereby releasing or absorbing energy from the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are alternative embodiments showing temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including a liquid material <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> housed in a first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and a solid material <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> housed in a second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> separated by a frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. In these embodiments, a frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> separates the first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> from the second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. The frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> can extend a portion of the width of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or can extend the entire width of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> between the first and the second chambers <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, a frangible seal may be designed narrowly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 13</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in order to minimize backflow of the liquid material <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> into the first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> after activation. Alternatively, or additionally, the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can also include a progressively narrowing channel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> that can further restrict the backflow of liquid material <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> into the first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> after activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> depict another embodiment of a temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that can be used in a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid heating, or cooling, system. A first liquid material is housed in a first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and a second liquid material or solid material housed in a second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. The frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> can extend across all or a portion of the width of the heating, or cooling, element. Further, channel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> can extend into the second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> in order to prevent a backflow of the first and second liquid materials into the first chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> after activation. Alternately, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> show a temperature-changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> where exit channel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is located within seal area <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, allowing for full use of the heating chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> shows a temperature-changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with at least two channels <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> that can be used in a solid-liquid or a liquid-liquid heating/cooling system for a substantially one-way flow of fluid into chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. This allows for delivery of the fluid material to multiple locations within the chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. This can be useful in larger packages where fluid wicking can be difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the case of a solid-liquid system, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can also include a solid material <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The solid material <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> can be contained loosely within the water impermeable outer layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or contained within one or more porous, liquid permeable compartments <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> contained within second chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. The compartments <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> can be formed by a porous material such as a porous cellulosic material (e.g., wet-laid or air-laid), a porous polymeric film such as a polyethylene film which has been needle-punched or vacuumed-formed, a polymeric mesh material such as a woven nylon mesh material such as Nitex&trade; supplied by Sefar America Inc., Depew, N.Y. etc. Preferably, the pore size of the porous material is smaller than the particles of the solid in the case of a solid-liquid system material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The heat generator can also include one or more compartments that house the solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that solid material(s) can be packed within one or more compartments of the heating chamber at a material volume of about 60% to about 95% of the available compartment space in order to keep the solid material in close proximity to each other. Tight packing of solid material(s) in one or more compartments of the pouch can prevent the solid material(s) from shifting in temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and can also prevent &ldquo;saddle-bagging.&rdquo; It is further believed that keeping a solid material(s) in a packed state within one or more compartments can promote even heating, or cooling, in the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via a defined and repeatable amount of component per unit volume. It is further believed that this can reduce the material surface area exposure thus, reducing rapid heat losses of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in exothermic systems. This can result in an effective manner in which to meter the rate that the heat produced, or consumed, by the exothermic, or endothermic, system due to forced conduction through a packed bed. In alternative embodiments, the pouch may further distribute the liquid material(s) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> across the surface of the solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the solid-liquid system through wicking and/or capillary action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a liquid distribution layer such as the layer <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> can be provided in proximity to the solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the solid-liquid system to distribute the liquid material(s) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> across the surface of the solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> through wicking and/or capillary action such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. It is believed that this can be useful when solid material(s) are contained in a porous sheet that will not readily wick the aqueous solution across its surface or when the solid materials are contained loosely within a water impermeable outer layer <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. An exemplary liquid distribution layer can include a cellulosic material such as paper towel layers such as Bounty&reg;, sold by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, capillary channel fibers, hydrophilic woven and non-woven materials, Dri-Weave&reg;, or any other distribution materials known to one of skill in the art. Further, materials such as cellulosic materials, superabsorbent polymers, and/or other hydroscopic materials, may be interspersed within the particles of the solid material(s) in order to allow for a more even dispersion of the liquid material(s) throughout the solid material(s) and a more and full usage of the material(s). This may be especially useful in embodiments where the solid material(s) are mixed with additives such as encapsulated phase change materials such as Thermasorb Series&reg; available from Frisby Technologies, Winston-Salem, N.C., or polyethylene powders that are slightly hydrophobic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Further, the addition of cellulosic materials can be beneficial in embodiments where another additive such as guar or xanthan gum is added to the reactant material(s) to help tailor the temperature profile but may also affect the rate at which the reaction occurs due to a viscosity change in an aqueous solution liquid material. Further, the addition of cellulosic materials may also be beneficial where reactive materials such as magnesium sulfate or calcium chloride, in a packed form, will form a thin crystal sheet across the areas where the water first comes in contact with them. This may impede the progress of the water to areas of the packed bed that are below the crystal surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Exothermic solid-liquid heating systems can include solid materials such as calcium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, cerous chloride, cesium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, ferric chloride, copper sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium perchlorate, aluminum bromide, calcium aluminum hydride, aluminum chloride, sulfur trioxide (alpha form), zeolites (e.g., Carbsorb&reg; 500 Series natural zeolite based on the mineral chabazite), mixtures thereof and other solid components of solid-liquid exothermic systems known in the art and combinations there of. An endothermic solid-liquid cooling system can include solid materials such as sodium sulfate*10H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, sodium bicarbonate, potassium perchlorate, potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium chromate, urea, vanillin, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium dichromate, ammonium chloride and other solid components of endothermic systems known in the art. These solid materials can be in an anhydrous form and can be used in a powder, granular, and/or prilled condition. These materials are generally hydroscopic and dissolve in or react with a liquid component, such as water, and give off, or absorb, heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further exothermic solid-liquid systems can include an electrochemical reaction including solid materials such as iron, magnesium, aluminum, or combinations thereof, that react in the presence of salt and water. In these embodiments, the liquid material may include a salt-water solution or may include water if salt is included with the solid material(s) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Yet another solid-liquid or liquid-liquid exothermic system includes systems that use the heat of neutralization to exude heat using acid and base materials such as citric acid having a pH of about 3 or 4 and calcium hydroxide having a pH of 12 in an approximate 2 to 1 ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can include a separate rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> containing a liquid material <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, inside of a second larger <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> pouch containing a solid or secondary liquid material <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid system. Heat-sealing, adhesive, or other attachment method <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> can fix the location of separate rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in second larger pouch <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. This can result in separate rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> being offset from item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when second larger pouch <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is incorporated into a heating package. The element can also include a seal about the periphery and across the width of pouch <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> to separate the large pouch <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> into two smaller chambers <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. Chambers <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> can be connected by a small gap <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> in the seal across the width <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. Small gap <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> can allow water to enter upper chamber <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> from lower chamber <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> once it is released from rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can be formed from a metallized film or other material having a low moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) in order to minimize losses of the liquid component(s) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> prior to activation of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can also include frangible seal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to facilitate rupturing the seal by squeezing or otherwise applying pressure to the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can include weakened portions in the pouch material such as scores, perforations, pull tabs, metal shavings, or other items that can puncture the rupturable pouch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> upon the application of pressure, or other method of rupturing a pouch known to one of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference> show another embodiment of a temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> including a supercooled aqueous salt solution(s) <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. This can facilitate manufacturing heat packs in a supercooled condition and activated with an internal release of heat when desired. Examplary salts include sodium acetate, sodium thiosulfate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate. Activation disk <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can be locked in an offset position in the element by seals <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> that form a small chamber from which the activation disk <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> cannot escape. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can comprise one or more attachment tabs <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> for attaching the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to structure of the heating package at various points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be activated by applying pressure to the offset activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that can be offset from item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This pressure breaks frangible seal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing a first material (i.e. water) from first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This material can then be channeled through a constriction to a bed of second material. Upon mixing of the first and second materials, chemical heating and/or cooling can occur. In the case of heating, energy generated by the reaction can then be transferred to item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the form of heat. When cooling is desired, energy is removed from item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After sufficient time, package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be opened and item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can then be removed and used, or used within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Insulation Layer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can also include an insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Preferably, insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is directly adhered and/or coextensive with outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using any method known in the art such as heat-sealing, adhesives, ultrasonics, etc. Insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can comprise materials including but not limited to foamed polyethylene, silicone rubber, fibrous cellulose structures, rigid thermoformed films having a plurality of depressions that can provide air pockets (i.e., lattice with a large amount of void space), and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, two insulation pads, which are 3&frac12;-inch&times;5-inch (8.9 cm&times;12.7 cm) pieces of foamed PE (Volara&trade;) of 60 mil (1.524 mm) thickness are attached to outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by heat sealing along the top and bottom of either. Optionally, outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can function as an insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This can be accomplished by providing the insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a co-extruded, or laminate, structure with outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be an outer sleeve surrounding outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and thus, package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Preferably, insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be larger in area than first chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This is desirous because first chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can preferably contain an exothermic/endothermic material. Thus, insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> could separate the entire outer surface of first chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from the outside of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This can prevent the outside surface of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from becoming too hot, while also maintaining the heat inside the pouch to better heat the item contained within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Additionally, insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be integral to walls of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Support Member </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can also include a support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed so that the item contained within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is offset from the activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this way, support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can provide the offset activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that providing support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a thin foil, or metallized film, can promote even heat transfer to the contained item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the sealant layer on both sides of the film. This can allow the support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be attached to the inside surface of outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or inside surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and still be sealed on the opposite surface. Preferably, the attachment point for support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located at the top edge <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> near opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Then, support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be sealed to itself along side edges <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forming a pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to contain item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be a sheet material that forms an inner &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, the &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can offset item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the offset activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the action of activation does not impact the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It was surprisingly found that support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can prevent direct contact between the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and also isolates the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the chemical reaction in case of chemical leakage. The softening point of the adhesive should be higher than that within package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> if support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adhesively bonded to outer wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this support member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can optionally be in the form of a separate closed sachet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> containing the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from closed sachet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and then removed from closed sachet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to use. This can also provide additional protection from any chemical elements as described supra. In this embodiment, the top of closed sachet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be secured at the exit point of the outer sachet by a releasable adhesive or other means <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, to suspend the item away from the activation point <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be supported above the activation point (which is also the first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) by using one or more strips <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form a sling. One or more strips <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> used in this manner can provide an offset to the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> yet provide little interference between item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can contain items <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as food items, moist (or dry) substrates, liquids, particles, or combinations thereof. Exemplary food items may include dough-wrapped food articles that are either shelf-stable or refrigeration-dependent, or multiple sized particles. The self-heating package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be designed around the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be heated. If the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thick, the package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may require gusseting. However, it is envisioned that the package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is activated with one hand by compression of the end of the package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where the first chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> containing the first material is located. The package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be designed to provide a snug fit with the item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to minimize air gaps that can reduce system thermal energy transfer efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In an exothermic system, the reaction can cause the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to expand upon activation. This can position item <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> closer to temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so heating does not need to rely on transfer through an air gap. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The material comprising outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was a 5 mil (127 &mgr;m) paper/foil/LDPE laminate film, cut to a 5&frac12;-inch&times;14-inch (13.97 cm&times;35.56 cm) sheet. Two insulation pads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> were formed from 3&frac12;-inch&times;5-inch (8.9 cm&times;12.7 cm) pieces of 60 mil (1.524 mm) foamed PE (Volara&trade;). Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was made from a 3.5 mil (88.9 &mgr;m) metallized OPP (oriented polypropylene) and Surlyn&trade; laminate. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> contained 7 ml of water and 10 g of a 2:1 anhydrous citric acid (granule):anhydrous calcium oxide (powder) mixture. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> was attached to the outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on top of the insulation pads <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by heat sealing the exposed sealant layer of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the sealing layer of the outer walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The foil liner was manufactured from a 4&frac12;-inch&times;10-inch (11.43 cm&times;25.4 cm) piece of 1.5 mil (38.1 &mgr;m) metallized OPP and Surlyn&trade; laminate film. The foil liner was then folded to form a gusseted or flat pouch. The pouch was then heat sealed along two outer edges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a PopTart&trade; weighing 50 g was inserted. The pouch was then sealed along top edges <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can include two temperature changing elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> adhesively or thermally attached to each other around the peripheral edge of second chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In other words, three side edges of second chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> form an inner pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for holding an item <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can also include a first chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> incorporating activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and frangible seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. By sealing the package around the peripheral edge of the second pocket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can maintain item <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in an offset position from the activation point <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of first chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. This can facilitate folding temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> along the frangible seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (i.e., first chamber <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is folded to overlay second chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) to prevent unintentional activation. Additionally, insulator layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be added, coextensively or externally, to temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be sealed across the top edge <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for closure. Formation of the package can also be accomplished by designing temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so that an outer sheet comprising temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is larger than an inner sheet, thereby exposing the inner layer of the outer sheet. This inner layer of the outer sheet may be polymeric in nature and can be sealed along the two side edges <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the top edge <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to provide a mirror image of the other temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> system comprising one or more sides <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of a paperboard box can be lined with at least one temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an insulator <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> disposed thereabout. Frangible seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be co-located along the seam of the fold of end flaps <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the flaps of box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are closed, the frangible seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is folded, reinforcing frangible seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and reducing the likelihood of an unintended activation of the temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Activation of the system could require opening the box and applying pressure to a first chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> located on the flap <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to rupture the frangible seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Upon rupture of the frangible seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a first material in chamber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is caused to contact a second material contained in a second chamber <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. End flaps <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be re-closed by use of an insertion tab <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> while an item <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> located within pocket <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is heated. The item <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be enclosed in a protective wrap or pouch to prevent contamination. The temperature changing elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are attached via a suitable adhesive, or heat-sealing to a polymer coated paperboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21, 21A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B, the box <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be a &ldquo;pop-open&rdquo; box that is dispensed in a flat form, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>A, and opened by pressing the bottom <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> until it locks, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</cross-reference>. The user may then place an item <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> in the box <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be heated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21, 21A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>B, box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can include an insulation layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a first chamber <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, a second chamber <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a frangible seal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> separating or joining both chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> depicts a thermoformed carton, or other shaped material <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> resembling a clamshell design, and including insulation layers <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, folded along a hinge <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. Temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes a first chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a second chamber <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, and a frangible seal <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> disposed between the first chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and the second chamber <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. The upper and lower halves of the thermoformed carton are designed to include a reservoir to provide a location to hold first chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The reservoir can be located at either hinge <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, or at the opening <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Both the upper and lower halves of the thermoformed carton can include temperature changing element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The thermoformed carton can be provided with a closure mechanism <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, for instance, a mating notch. The user activates the system by applying pressure to the first chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing material out of first chamber <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, through the channel <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and into the second chamber <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> located on either side of the item <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a thermochromatic indicator that signals item readiness can be incorporated into any of the systems described supra. This indicator can indicate the time required to heat an item based on a given environment. Additionally, easy open features such as tear notches, tear strips, or perforation may be added, and reuse features such as Ziploc&reg; or food grade pressure-sensitive adhesives may be added. </paragraph>
