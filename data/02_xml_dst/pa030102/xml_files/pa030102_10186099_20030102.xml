<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an optical reception apparatus and an optical transmission system, and more specifically relates to an optical reception apparatus capable of informing deterioration of transmission quality in an optical communication system to the following apparatuses and an optical transmission system to control line connections using the optical reception apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In an optical communication system, an optical transmitter error correction code encodes a SONET/SDH flame of OC-48/STM-16 or OC-192/STM-64 and sends it onto an optical fiber transmission line, and an optical receiver corrects transmission errors using an error correction code and outputs the SONET/SDH flame of OC-48/STM-16 or OC-192/STM-64. As an error correcting system, a foward error correction (FEC) system has been known. An FEC system having more advanced error-correcting ability is also well known (see, for instance, T. Mizouchi, et al., &ldquo;Transparent multiplexer featuring super FEC for optical transport networking&rdquo;, proceedings of SubOptic 2001, pp. 484-487). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, quality of an optical transmission line is unstable, and the unstableness appears more clearly as its distance becomes longer and its bit rate becomes higher. By introducing error-correcting technology with high correcting ability, it is possible to obtain transmission of practically error-free even in a transmission line having poor quality. For instance, in an optical transmission line which quality varies in a range from 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>with its average quality of 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>, an error rate after error correction varies between an error-free state and a frame-loss state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, an optical transmission system, specifically an optical transmission system of trunk lines is designed to be able to select from a plurality of lines or routes to prepare for line fault. An electric crossconnector or a photonic crossconnector is well known as a means to switch traffic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A large number of transmission errors can be corrected by the FEC system. Since high correction ability is obtained in the error correcting technology described in the above paper, it is possible not only to realize practically error-free transmission in a wide range but also to use optical transmission lines having inferior quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this error correcting technology, however, an error rate after error correction rapidly increases if an error rate before error correction exceeds a certain threshold value (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the above-described paper). For example, when an error rate before error correction deteriorates from 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>, an error rate after error correction greatly worsens from 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;11 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an optical transmission line used in high error correcting ability, a little deterioration of transmission characteristics is likely to cause disabled conditions. Accordingly, when a transmission error as serious as to cause such disablement occurs in a line, the line is switched to another line by a crossconnector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, any means to easily monitor such deterioration in transmission characteristics has not been proposed yet. Conventionally, an abnormal condition in a transmission line is merely detected on a result obtained by restoring a data carried by an optical carrier. Therefore, in a conventional system, alarm signals are output from many parts to inform deterioration of transmission characteristics in an optical fiber transmission line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a crossconnector switches lines manually or automatically when an abnormal condition occurs in a transmission line as mentioned above. Some electric crossconnectors have an error monitoring function. When such an electric crossconnector is employed, it is possible to make the electric crossconnector automatically switch working lines when the error rate reaches a certain value. When such an automatic switching system is used, however, transmission characteristics often become unstable because the line switching causes chattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, since signals are transmitted in an inferior transmission quality until the line having a high error rate is switched to another line, packet retransmission is repeated. This increases loads in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a photonic crossconnector, a special electric device must be installed to calculate an error rate of input optical signals. This reduces merits to utilize a photonic crossconnector instead of an electric crossconnector. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention are explained below in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a schematic block diagram of an embodiment according to the invention. A plurality of optical fiber lines (2 lines are shown in the illustration) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are selectable between a transmission terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a reception terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is being selected at the beginning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the transmission terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is explained below. An optical router <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> applies data to be transmitted for the reception terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> out of input data (for example, OC-48/STM-16 form data) carried by a light wave. A controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls a route in the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Optical transmission apparatuses <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> respectively connect to a plurality of output ports of the photonic crossconnectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At the beginning, the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to supply the input data to the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, an optical receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives an optical signal from the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and an opto-electric converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> converts the output from the optical receiver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into an electric signal and applies it to an FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adds an error correction code of FEC to the signal from the opto-electric converter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. An electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> converts the error correction code encoded data from the FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into an optical signal, and an optical transmitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> outputs the optical signal from the electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> onto the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a predetermined form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An inside configuration of the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is the same with that of the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> processes an optical signal from the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the same way with that of the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and transmits onto an optical fiber line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the reception terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is explained below. An optical reception apparatuses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receive an optical signal from the optical fiber lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively. The configurations of the optical reception apparatuses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are exactly the same and the details are described later. The optical signals received by the optical reception apparatuses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> enter an photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through normally closed optical switches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> respectively. Judging circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> judge transmission quality of the optical fibers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to error rate information before error correction of the optical fibers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the optical reception apparatuses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a judging threshold value Ref and control to open or close the optical switches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> according to the judged result. A controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> controls optical routes in the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The optical signal selected by the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is applied to an optical router <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The optical router <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> transmits the optical signal from the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to an apparatus (which is not illustrated) designated by the optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an optical receiver <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives the optical signal from the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and an opto-electric converter <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> converts the output from the optical receiver <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> into an electric signal and applies it to an FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> corrects errors of the transmission data using the error correction code added by the FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and applies the corrected data to an electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an error rate before error correction to a judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> converts the error-corrected data from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into an optical signal and applies it to an optical transmitter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The optical transmitter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> applies the output optical signal from the electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a predetermined form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> compares the error rate before error correction from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with a predetermined threshold value Ref to judge transmission quality of the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The threshold value Ref is set to the error rate before error correction which is a little smaller than a correction limit of the FEC. When the transmission quality is poor, the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> opens (turns off) the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. That is, the connection of the optical signals between the optical receiver <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is blocked. Judging conditions of the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The characteristic operation of this embodiment is explained below. The data to be transmitted from the terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passes through the router <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the router <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the optical transmission apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> error correction code encodes the transmission data, and the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> corrects the transmission error in the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using an error correction code added by the FEC encoder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> transmits the error corrected data to the electro-optical converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and applies the error rate information before error correction to the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> judges the transmission quality of the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the error rate from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the predetermined threshold value Ref and turns off (opens) the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the transmission quality is poor and turns on (closes) the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the transmission quality is satisfactory. When the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is turned off, the optical signal transmission from the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the transmission of the optical signal from the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shut off, the data of the terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> emitted from the optical router <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> becomes practically non-signal. An operator or a controller, which is not illustrated, can switch from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> before the transmission quality of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> deteriorates exceeding the error correcting ability of the FEC system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Most of the photonic crossconnectors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> comprise a function to monitor the existence of input light in each input port. Using this function, the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can detect that no optical signal inputs from the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. When no optical signal inputs although the input port is in use, it means that a fault occurred in a signal transmission system connecting to the input port. In this case, the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> controls the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to select another line, the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the embodiment, and informs the controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the transmission terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the line switching (including the information of newly employed lines) through any transmission medium. The controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to switch from the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to the information from the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The judging method of the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is explained below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the relation between error rates before and after error correction using the FEC and a threshold value Ref. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the above-mentioned paper. The horizontal axis expresses an error rate before error correction, and the vertical axis expresses an error rate after error correction. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> denotes a case without a FEC system, reference numeral <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> denotes a case when an initial FEC system is applied, and reference numeral <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> denotes when an improved FEC (super FEC) system is applied, respectively. A threshold value Ref is set to a value equal to an error rate before error correction which is a little smaller than an error correction ability limit of the improved FEC (super FEC) system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As a first judging method, the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> simply compares the error rate from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with the threshold value Ref and switches off the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate exceeds the threshold value Ref and switches on the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate becomes less than the threshold value Ref. When the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is turned off, generally the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> switches to another line (here, to the optical fiber line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) and therefore any inconvenience such as chattering which tends to occur at line switching does not occur even if the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is turned on afterwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As a second judging method, the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> turns off the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> keeps to exceed the threshold value Ref continues for a certain period T1 and turns on the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate keeps to be less than the threshold value Ref for the certain period T1 or a certain period T2 which differs to the T1. In this method, instantaneous deterioration of transmission quality can be neglected. Because there is a possibility to be able to process such instantaneous deterioration of the transmission quality within the error correction ability since the threshold value Ref is set smaller than the error correction ability limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The transmission quality of an optical fiber line often shows a variation in which gradually changing deterioration and temporary instantaneous deterioration are put together. A third method is that the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> turns off the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate from the FEC decoder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> exceeds the threshold value Ref as many as a predetermined number of times K within a certain period T3 and turns on the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when the error rate continually keeps a condition being smaller than the threshold value for a certain period T4 which is longer than T3. Because it is preferable to restart the operation after the transmission quality is recovered continuously and satisfactorily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the above examples, although the judging threshold value to turn on the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is set equal to the judging threshold value Ref to turn off the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that the judging threshold value to turn on the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is smaller than the judging threshold value Ref to turn off the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in consideration of the satisfactory recovery of the transmission quality. Also, this helps to avoid chattering of the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, although the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are disposed outside the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to make it understandable, it is obvious that the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the judging circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be disposed in the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Also, the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be disposed in the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a case to employ an electric crossconnector instead of the photonic crossconnector <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to dispose an electric switch corresponding to the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on an output side of an opto-electric converter disposed between the optical reception apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the electric crossconnector. If the electric switch corresponding to the optical switch <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is disposed on an input side of the opto-electric converter, it is likely that noises etc. enter the electric crossconnector and make the electric crossconnector misjudge whether any input signal exists or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, since signals are blocked before the transmission quality of a transmission fiber line becomes a condition impossible to correct, the following apparatuses can detect the transmission quality by monitoring whether any signal exists or not and therefore can afford to switch over lines earlier. By this operation, severe transmission errors can be avoided in advance with a simple configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a method in which alarms are emitted from a number of places, it takes a long time to specify a fault location and a fault source. However, in a method to block signals like the one used in the invention, a number of alarms become relatively small making it easier to find out a fault. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As readily understandable from the aforementioned explanation, according to the invention, transmission quality of an optical transmission line can be monitored to switch lines before the transmission quality becomes a condition impossible to correct with a simple configuration using existing elements. That is, severe errors can be avoided in advance using a simple configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made to the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
