<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. The Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of percutaneous medical filters, and more specifically, to vascular filter devices that are configured for percutaneous insertion into a blood vessel of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. The Relevant Technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Human blood vessels often become occluded or blocked by plaque, thrombi, other deposits, or material that reduce the blood carrying capacity of the vessel. Should the blockage occur at a critical place in the circulatory system, serious and permanent injury, and even death, can occur. To prevent this, some form of medical intervention is usually performed when significant occlusion is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several procedures are now used to open these stenosed or occluded blood vessels in a patient caused by the deposit of plaque or other material on the walls of the blood vessels. Angioplasty, for example, is a widely known procedure wherein an inflatable balloon is introduced into the occluded region. The balloon is inflated, dilating the occlusion, and thereby increasing the intraluminal diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another procedure is atherectomy. During atherectomy, a catheter is inserted into a narrowed artery to remove the matter occluding or narrowing the artery, i.e., fatty material. The catheter includes a rotating blade or cutter disposed in the tip thereof. Also located at the tip are an aperture and a balloon disposed on the opposite side of the catheter tip from the aperture. As the tip is placed in close proximity to the fatty material, the balloon is inflated to force the aperture into contact with the fatty material. When the blade is rotated, portions of the fatty material are shaved off and retained within the interior lumen of the catheter. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of fatty material is removed and substantially normal blood flow is resumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another procedure, stenosis within arteries and other blood vessels is treated by permanently or temporarily introducing a stent into the stenosed region to open the lumen of the vessel. The stent typically comprises a substantially cylindrical tube or mesh sleeve made from such materials as stainless steel or nitinol. The design of the material permits the diameter of the stent to be radially expanded, while still providing sufficient rigidity such that the stent maintains its shape once it has been enlarged to a desired size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, such percutaneous interventional procedures, i.e., angioplasty, atherectomy, and stenting, often dislodge material from the vessel walls. This dislodged material can enter the bloodstream, and may be large enough to occlude smaller downstream vessels, potentially blocking blood flow to tissue. The resulting ischemia poses a serious threat to the health or life of a patient if the blockage occurs in critical tissue, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, or brain, resulting in a stroke or infarction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In general, existing devices and technology have a number of disadvantages including high profile, difficulty using multiple parts and components that result in an involved procedure, manufacturing complexity, and complex operation of the device or system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods, and devices for overcoming the above-referenced problems. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention include filter devices that have small, low, or no profiles, few parts and components, and are simple to manufacture and use. Consequently, embodiments of the present invention are able to be easily inserted into a patient, be steerable through the tortuous anatomy of a patient, provide filtering capabilities, have a sufficiently low profile to provide exchange capability so other medical devices can be advanced along the filter device, and be capable of removing the captured material without allowing such material to escape during filter retrieval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of one embodiment of present invention, an illustrative embodiment of the present invention includes a vascular filter device. This device includes a guide member, such as a guidewire or hypo-tube having a lumen that extends from a distal end toward a proximal end thereof. Disposed within the lumen are one or more actuating members and a filter assembly. The one or more actuating members are coupled to an actuating mechanism at the proximal end of the guide member and are configured to deploy the filter assembly during a procedure, such as through movement of one or more actuating members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The filter assembly includes a filter and a plurality of radially spaced-apart struts connected to a peripheral edge of a proximal end of the filter. The struts expand outwardly upon being deployed from the lumen of the guide member to place the peripheral edge of the proximal end of the filter adjacent to the wall of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The filter includes a plurality of pores or holes that are so sized to capture material that may become detached during the procedure. The proximal end of the filter is configured to be constrained against the blood vessel within which the filter is disposed, while the distal end, in one embodiment, is configured to &ldquo;float&rdquo; within the blood flowing through the blood vessel and change shape to collect material and maintain the flow of blood through the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the filter device includes a number of radiopaque bands and/or markers affixed to a variety of positions on the device. These radiopaque bands and/or markers are one example of means for radiopacity, with various other means for radiopacity being known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> During use of the filter device of the present invention, blood flow will cause the filter to assume a parachute-like configuration such that material is collected within the interior of the filter. To remove the filter and the material, in one embodiment, the actuating member is moved in the proximal direction so that the proximal end of the filter cooperates with the distal end of the lumen through the guide member. Upon positioning the proximal end of the filter, a capture catheter is moved or advanced along the guide member until the catheter substantially encloses the filter. Following positioning of the capture catheter, the catheter and guide member are removed from the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the present invention, a guide member includes a plurality of struts disposed at the distal end of the guide member. In one configuration, the distal end of the guide member is divided into a plurality of struts, at least two of which are biased to move outwardly. In another configuration, a strut assembly is coupled to the distal end of the guide member, with the strut assembly including one or more struts attached to the filter, while formed at a distal end of a third strut is a coil tip. This third strut is optionally biased toward the center of the lumen of the guide member. Before the filter is deployed, the filter is folded about the distal end of the guide member, folded about one or more of the plurality of struts, and/or is positioned within the lumen of the guide member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To maintain the struts in the closed position, i.e., not extending outwardly from the remaining body of the guide member, a retaining member or mechanism cooperates with the guide member and/or struts and applies a restraining force to one or more of the struts. By moving the guide member relative to the restraining member, or vice versa, the distal ends of two or more of the biased struts are allowed to move outwardly to deploy the filter, i.e., the restraining force is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism surrounds a tip of the guide member, including the struts and a part of the guide member. This restraining member or mechanism can be attached to the struts and is configured to apply a restraining force to the one or more struts. In one configuration, the restraining member or mechanism is configured to separate into a number of different sections to allow the distal ends of two or more of the biased struts to move outwardly to deploy the filter. In another embodiment, the restraining member or mechanism includes two or more actuating members that are attached to a location just proximal to the proximal end of each strut. The two or more actuating members extend to the distal end of the guide member, pass through apertures in the distal end of the restraining member or mechanism, and terminate within the lumen of the guide member after passing through holes formed in the guide member proximal to the proximal end of each strut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To actuate the filter device, an actuating assembly at the proximal end of the guide member draws the actuating members in the proximal direction. Since one end of the actuating member is located at the proximal end of the restraining member or mechanism, whether forming part of the restraining member or mechanism, attached to the restraining member or mechanism, or attached to the guide member, pulling the actuating member in the proximal direction causes the actuating member to preferentially separate the restraining member or mechanism, thereby releasing the strut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism includes a plurality of apertures formed therein. The restraining member or mechanism has a first portion and a second portion with one or more of the plurality of apertures formed therein. The restraining member or mechanism further includes a securing member that passes through one or more of the plurality apertures to cause the first portion to be releasably connected to the second portion. The securing member passes through an aperture in the guide member and/or a strut assembly to pass into the end of the guide member and extend toward the proximal end. Upon moving the securing member in a proximal direction using one of a variety of different actuating mechanisms, a distal end of the securing member is removed from the apertures and the first and second both portions of the restraining member or mechanism. In this manner, the force applied to the struts to maintain a closed configuration, where the struts are retained or prevented from extending outwardly, is released from the struts, enabling them to deploy the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In still another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism includes a securing member that is &ldquo;sewn&rdquo; through portions of the restraining member. In a similar manner to the configuration discussed above, the securing member can be removed from cooperating with the restraining member or mechanism to allow the struts to extend outwardly and deploy the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In still another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism includes a plurality of channels. These channels are formed on both first and second ends of the filter in an offset configuration. The securing member can pass through one or more of the channels formed in the first side and the second side to maintain the first side in cooperative engagement with the second side. In this manner, the restraining member or mechanism applies a restraining force to the one or more struts and prevents them from extending outwardly. Upon moving the securing member in a proximal direction, a distal end of the securing member is removed from within the channels formed in the first side and second side, thereby releasing the restraining force applied by the restraining member or mechanism against the one or more struts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In still another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism has the form of a sleeve that is adapted with one or more hoops formed therein. The wire forms a channel by maintaining a first set of hoops and second set of hoops in engagement using a securing member. By removing the securing member from engaging within one or more of the hoops, the first side and second side of the restraining member or mechanism can disengage with one another and release the restraining force that was applied to the one or more struts. In this manner, the struts are able to deploy the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In yet another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism is combined with the one or more struts of the filter device. In such a configuration, two or more of the struts include tubular members adapted to receive a securing member. As the struts are brought towards each other, the lumens of the tubular members become aligned so that the securing member can pass therethrough to prevent the struts from extending outwardly or otherwise maintain the struts together or in close proximity one to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In still another configuration, the restraining member or mechanism is combined with the filter of the filter device. In this configuration, the filter includes at least one flap that is adapted to extend through the gap disposed between two struts. The flap(s) can be wrapped around the struts and secured to prevent the struts from extending outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to percutaneous filter devices, systems, and methods of using the same. Embodiments of the present invention can be utilized in association with devices, systems, and methods for inserting a filter device, such as but not limited to a vascular filter device, within any blood vessel of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> One or more of the embodiments of the filter devices of the present invention meet criteria for both guidewires and filter devices. For instance, it is preferable that a guidewire is steerable. Consequently, embodiments of the filter device of the present invention can be insertable within any blood vessel of a patient, such as but not limited to, coronary artery, carotid arteries, renal arteries, bypass grafts, superficial femoral artery, the arteries of the upper and lower extremities, or cerebral vasculature, and manipulated and steered by a physician to traverse the tortuous anatomy of the patient to a lesion or occlusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> To assist the physician with the above-recited endeavor, one or more embodiments of the filter device include a shapeable, soft, distal tip. In addition, the filter device is capable of translating rotational movement or force applied to the proximal end thereof substantially equally to the distal end. In other words, with the filter device positioned within a vessel of the patient, as a physician rotates the proximal end of the filter device, the distal end of the filter device rotates substantially simultaneously with the movement of the proximal end. This is typically defined as having a one-to-one torqueability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Further, the filter device of the present invention is kink resistant and is capable of receiving a variety of different coatings to improve lubricity, have anti-thrombogenic properties, and/or reduce platelet aggregation. These coatings can include, but are not limited to, a hydrophilic coating, a heparinized coating, Teflon, silicone, or other coating known to those skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> With respect to the filter of the filter device of the present invention, in one embodiment, the filter is configured to capture material of a variety of sizes and enable removal of the captured material. Therefore, filter pore sizes and shapes can be selected based upon the size of material to be captured. The material can include but is not limited to, particulates, thrombi, any atherosclerosis or plaque material dislodged during a procedure, or other foreign material that may be introduced in to the vasculature of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, depicted is one embodiment of a vascular filter device, designated by reference number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, of the present invention. As illustrated, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Extending between distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within which is disposed an actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is configured for percutaneous insertion into a blood vessel of a patient, while proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is configured with or couples to an actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of being insertable into any blood vessel of a patient or body and function as a guidewire or exchange wire for other medical components or devices, such as but not limited to catheters, stents, balloons, atherectomy devices, or other components or devices that can be exchanged using a guidewire. Further, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used to filter particulates, as will be described in more detail hereinafter, thereby acting or providing embolic protection during a procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Illustratively, the term &ldquo;guide member&rdquo; can refer to a member that is completely solid, such as a guidewire, a member that partially includes a lumen therein, or a member that includes a lumen extending from a proximal end to a distal end thereof, such as a hypo-tube. Consequently, the term &ldquo;guide member&rdquo; can include or encompass a guidewire or a hypo-tube that is configured to perform the functions described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a variety of materials. For example, guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from Nitinol, steel, metals, metal alloys, composites, plastic, polymer, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. Further, guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be covered with a variety of different coatings, such as but not limited to, coatings to improve lubricity or having anti-thrombogenic properties, reduce platelet aggregation, hydrophilic coatings, a heparinized coating, Teflon, silicone, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Illustratively, guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can have an outside diameter of between about 0.010 inches to about 0.035 inches, between about 0.014 inches to about 0.018 inches, or between about 0.010 inches to about 0.018 inches. In one configuration, the outside diameter of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is about 0.014 inches. Similarly, the diameter of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can range from about 0.004 inches to about 0.029 inches or between about 0.008 inches to about 0.014 inches. In one configuration, the diameter of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is about 0.008 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the exemplary distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a step configuration, with a step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a smaller diameter than other portions of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For ease of explanation, actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> have been excluded from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can have a variety of different configurations so long as it is adapted to couple with other portions of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For instance, step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can include multiple steps instead of a single step as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Consequently, distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could include a first step portion having a first outer diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the remaining portion of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> thereof. Further, distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could include a second step portion having a smaller outer diameter than the first outer diameter of the first portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Attached to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a lumen <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that extends between a distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> thereof. A portion of distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is substantially co-planar with distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, a portion of distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are contained within a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is coupled, connected, or attached to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Although this is the case in one embodiment of the present invention, one skilled in the art can identify various other configurations where this need not be the case. For instance, in an alternate configuration, distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are not co-planar. In another configuration, portions of distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are co-planar. In still another configuration, at least one of distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is angularly orientated relative to the longitudinal axis of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or lumen <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, either alone or in combination with distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is atraumatic. In this manner, as filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted within a blood vessel filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to slide along the interior surface of the blood vessel and is prevented from catching upon protrusions, i.e., lesions, occlusions, stenosis, or the like, during a procedure. One skilled in the art can identify a variety of different configurations of distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to perform such a desired function. For instance, the curvature of distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be varied as long as the curvature allows filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to slide along the interior surface of the blood vessel without catching upon protrusions; the curvature can be based upon distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or the distal end of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Proximal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to cooperate with a proximal end of step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Proximal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the proximal end of step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are substantially parallel one to another upon coupling, connecting, or attaching sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, the proximal end of step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can include one or more raised portions within which one or more complementary recesses formed in proximal end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> mate, or vice versa. In still another configuration, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a stepped configuration that allows matting with a complementary configured stepped proximal end of step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as when step portion includes multiple steps. Various other configurations are applicable to allow sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the remainder of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to couple, connect, or be attached one to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an outside diameter substantially the same as the outer diameter of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while the diameter of lumen <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the outer diameter of step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is coupled to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has substantially the same outer diameter along its length. In other configurations, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a smaller or larger diameter than guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to friction fit to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the inner diameter of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to securely mount to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upon slidable engagement of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In other configurations, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be affixed to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with an adhesive, such as but not limited to, any medical grade adhesive, UV curable adhesive, or other adhesive that cause sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to securely connect to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be press fit, soldered, mechanical attached, or coupled to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using any other mechanism that causes sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be securely connected to step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In still other configurations, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have a key configuration where sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes at least one key and step portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes at least one key way to receive the at least one key, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In general, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a variety of different materials and have a variety of different configurations. For example, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from steel, titanium, platinum, metals, metal alloys, composites, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. Further, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can include means for radiopacity. Additionally, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from (i) a radiopaque substance, (ii) a non-radiopaque substance and coated with a radiopaque substance, or (iii) a non-radiopaque substance doped with a radiopaque substance. The radiopaque substances can include, but not limited to, barium sulphate, bismuth subcarbonate, titanium dioxide, combinations thereof, or other radiopaque substances. In still another configuration, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can include one or more markers that have radiopaque characteristics. These markers can be fabricated from a radiopaque material, whether the material is radiopaque, a non-radiopaque material coated with a radiopaque material, or a non-radiopaque materials doped with a radiopaque material. Consequently, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can include means for radiopacity, whether such means results from the materials forming sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or from attaching, coupling, or connecting markers, bands, or other indicators having radiopaque properties or characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Disposed over sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and optionally a portion of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is configured to seal and secure sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> acts as a means for securing sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a thin walled plastic heat shrink tubing or silicon tubing. In other configurations, interference fit or compression fit plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, or silicon can be used that need not be heat shrunk. In general, cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be a medical grade synthetic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and/or the distal end of cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be configured, collectively, to form a bullet nose or have a curved profile. This can be in addition to or alternatively from only distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being curved or being atraumatic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Collectively, distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> form tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although this is one configuration, one skilled in the art can appreciate that tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be formed solely from or any combination of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> To provide flexibility to tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, embodiments of the present invention may include one or more grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that extend entirely or partially through one or more of distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sheath <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and cover <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>I. The flexibility of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> allows a physician or clinician to shape the tip and enable the guide member to be steered during a procedure. Consequently, the tip may maintain a level of resiliency so that a curvature defined by the physician or clinician is maintained during movement of the guide member through the tortuous anatomy of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;groove&rdquo; includes one or more cuts or slits that partially or completely extend through a portion of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, optionally including the sleeve and the securing member. Further, the term &ldquo;groove&rdquo; includes one or more cuts or slits that partially or completely surrounds a portion of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, whether or not such one or more cuts or slits extend completely or partially through one or more of the guide member, the sleeve, or the securing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can have a variety of different configurations, such as but not limited to straight, helical, geometric, or combinations thereof. For instance, a single groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can extend around all or a portion of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and optionally extend into the remainder of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, any number of grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be included in tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depending upon the degree of flexibility needed for a procedure. For example, the more grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> included in tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the greater the flexibility. Similarly, the depth of each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can vary depending upon the flexibility desired. For instance, the deeper grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> the greater the flexibility of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Similarly, difference in the configuration of each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can affect the flexibility of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For instance, the steeper the sides of grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the less flexibility of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>I, grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be disposed along the longitudinal length of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> equally, gradually, continuously, periodically, or combinations thereof. For instance, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a single helical groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that has an equal pitch along the length of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> depicts a single helical groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that has a gradually increasing pitch along the length of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, it can be understood that tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can include a single helical groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that has a gradually decreasing pitch along the length of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the proximal end to the distal end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can have a plurality of individual grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disposed along the length of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. It can be understood that each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> need not encircle tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; rather, each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can partially encircle tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as depicted illustratively in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> depicts a configuration of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> where groupings of grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, whether straight, helical, or geometric, are disposed at different portions of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</cross-reference> depicts a configuration where grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are large and have shallow sides, i.e., the angle between the axis of the groove that passes through the apex of the groove and the side of the groove is large. In the alternative, each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be small and have steep sides, i.e., the angle between the axis of the groove that passes through the apex of the groove and the side of the groove is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</cross-reference> illustrates a configuration of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where the pitch between adjacent grooves is increasing from the proximal end to the distal end of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the depth of each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> varies, i.e., each groove <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> need not extend the entire depth of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</cross-reference> illustrates a configuration of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are straight and extend into lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4I</cross-reference> illustrates a configuration where grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are helical and extend from the exterior of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The above described configurations of the grooves with tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are only illustrative and should not be considered as limiting the applicability of other configurations as known by one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. For instance, grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can pass through securing member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and terminate in guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can pass through sleeve <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and terminate in guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, be contained solely in guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, combinations thereof, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Generally, grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be formed in tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using a variety of different techniques, such as but not limited to, micro-machining, grinding, etching, laser cutting, abrasive water jet, electrical discharge machine, or the like. Further, grooves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can have a pitch of between about 0.015 inches to about 0.100 inches, from about 0.020 inches to about 0.060 inches, or from about 0.025 inches to about 0.050 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, depicted is a partial cross-sectional view of a lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Disposed within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are an actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forms part of actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is adapted to deploy and partially or completely retract filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Additionally, actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides structural support to filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and assists with preventing kinking of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends toward a proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the distal end of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a generally cylindrical form and is configured to create a seal between actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the interior walls of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments of the present invention, the remainder of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is configured to create a seal between actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the interior walls of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are not configured to create a seal with the interior walls of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, rather a separate seal, such as but not limited to, one or more O-rings, quad-rings, V-rings, gaskets, combinations thereof or other structure capable of creating a seals is mounted to head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to create a seal between the interior wall of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> cooperates or engages with filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and forces filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the distal end of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved during a procedure. By so doing, a filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is deployed to collect material. Further, head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be moved within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to retrieve filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, thereby aiding with removal of the collected material subsequent to a procedure or to allow for repositioning of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can have various other configurations so long as actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of deploying and retrieving filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. For instance, in another configuration, actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be devoid of head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and be formed from a plurality of wires, strands, or members that are braided together, connected to, or formed as part of filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a variety of different materials, such as but not limited to, stainless steel, tungsten, titanium, platinum, Nitinol, other metals, alloys thereof, composites, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>depicted is filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a deployed position following movement of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the distal direction. As illustrated, filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a plurality of radially spaced-apart struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extending from filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> separated from a proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A peripheral edge of proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is secured to struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to form an opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that allows material to flow into filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, while distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is closed to prevent material from escaping or exiting from filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Although in one configuration filter is hemispherical, it can be understood that filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be a variety of configurations, such as but not limited to, hemispherical, conical, cylindrical, combinations thereof, or any other configuration that allows for material to be collected therein, while the opening of the filter substantially extends to the peripheral surface of the blood vessel within which the filter is disposed. More generally, filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can have any configuration so long as proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has an opening that allows material to flow into filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is closed to prevent material from escaping or exiting from filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Intermediate portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are free to float in the blood flow or stream within the blood vessel, while proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is in a fixed relationship with actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. By allowing intermediate portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to float, as filter collects material, such as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the material creates drag on filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the shape of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> changes, while maintaining substantially the same volume as when deployed. Consequently, blood can continue to flow through portions of intermediate portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> continues to fill with material, as indicated by arrows A and B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this manner, material can be collected as blood flow is maintained through filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a variety of different materials, such as but not limited to, a woven or braided plastic or metallic mesh, a perforated polymer film, a Nitinol mesh, combinations thereof, or other material that is capable of capturing material within flowing blood, while allowing the blood to flow through the pores or apertures thereof. Generally, filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a variety of materials so long as filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is capable of being packed within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, floating in the blood flow or stream passing through the blood vessel within which it is inserted, and is biocompatible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can have a variety of differently sized pores <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> ranging from about 50 microns to about 200 microns, from about 60 microns to about 180 microns, or from about 75 microns to about 150 microns. For instance, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>pores <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can have a variety of different configurations, such as but not limited to circular, oval, polygonal, combinations thereof or other configurations known to one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. In one configuration, therefore, filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can includes pores that are differently sized and configured. Consequently, a major or minor axis of each pore can have a variety of different sizes ranging from about 50 microns to about 200 microns, from about 60 microns to about 180 microns, or from about 75 microns to about 150 microns. Generally, the pore size can vary as needed, so long as the pores are sized so that the pores do not compromise blood flow through the filter, i.e., prevent blood flowing through the filter, and collect material that could potentially occlude smaller downstream vessels, potentially blocking blood flow to tissue or result in stroke or infarction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above, filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be coated with a hydrophilic coating, a heparinized coating, Teflon, silicone, combinations thereof, or various other coatings as know or desired by one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>connecting filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and optionally directly to actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, are struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the distal ends of struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are connected at radially spaced-apart locations about the peripheral edge of proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> attach to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the exterior of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, on the interior of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, along the edge of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, through filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, or combinations of one or more of the above. The struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be attached to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and/or actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by medical grade adhesives, such as but not limited to, ultra violet curable adhesives, acrylics, cyanoacrylates, solvent bonding, radio frequency or ultrasonic bonding, or some other manner to securely connect the distal end of one or more struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be thermally bonded to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and/or actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as when struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are fabricated from a material allowing such thermal bonding. In another configuration, struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are woven into filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or are distally formed with hooks or loops that are can be used to attach struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be lengthened strands of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that extend from filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are extensions or strands of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as when actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a braided wire, a slit tube, or other member that is capable of performing the functions described herein with respect to actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are extensions of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that extend to head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and connect thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, each strut <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed from Nitinol, stainless steel, metals, alloys, composites, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, combinations thereof, or other materials that allow struts to perform one or more of the functions described herein. Each strut <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can have a generally curved distal portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and may be biased to extend radially outward when filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is to be deployed. In this manner, distal portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in close proximity to the wall of the blood vessel within which filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted when deployed. The struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend the edge of proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into contact with the wall of the blood vessel. By so doing, the proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can contact a substantial portion of the wall of the blood vessel and accommodate for variations in the profile of the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Although, reference is made to the edge of proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> contacting the blood vessel, other configurations of the present invention locate the edge of proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> adjacent to, in close proximity to, juxtaposed, or contiguous with the wall of the blood vessel. This can be the case, so long as material can be captured through opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and material is not captured between the outer surface of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the wall of the blood vessel within which filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, depicted is filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the captured or retrieved position. When actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved in the proximal direction, opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is drawn toward distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved in the proximal direction, the interior wall of lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> forces struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> inwardly. Simultaneously, distal end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of each strut <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> moves inwardly to close opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This simultaneous motion prevents material trapped within the interior of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from escaping. Opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can alternatively be substantially completely closed following the initial movement of actuator member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the proximal direction. In still another configuration, opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be partially closed as actuator member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is moved in the proximal direction and gradually becomes substantially completely closed upon a substantial portion of struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> being retracted into lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be substantially completely closed upon a portion of struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> being retracted into lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> To move actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the proximal direction and/or distal direction filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be integrated with guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or separate therefrom. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, depicted in an illustrative configuration of actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, depicted is an exemplary embodiment of an actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that can be used to manipulate actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Through operating actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) can be deployed and retrieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, actuating assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and actuator member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a distal end <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is configured to cooperate with guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while a proximal end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The distal end <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a step configuration and includes indentations <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that are configured to cooperate with complementary protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> formed in guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is moved in the distal direction, indentations <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> mate to position actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in a desired location relative to proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby positioning filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a selected position, such as in the retracted position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is continually moved in the distal direction, distal end <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> meets a wall <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> formed in guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that prevents further movement in the distal direction. Through this configuration, actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is prevented from excessive longitudinal displacement in the distal direction. This stopping of the longitudinal displacement of actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> indicates that filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Although reference is made to one manner to indicate the particular location filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, one skilled in the art can identify a variety of different manners. For instance, a plurality of indentations and/or protrusions can be included within actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to control the distance which actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and consequently filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved. In another configuration, a wall formed in actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> mates with the distal end of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to prevent excessive longitudinal displacement in the distal direction. In still another configuration, a combination of walls in actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be used. In still another configuration, distal end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is tapered and cooperates with a taper formed in proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The complementary tapers control the longitudinal displacement of actuating element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> relative to proximal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In still other configurations, a combination of indentations, protrusions, walls, or tapers can be used. Various other manners are known to control the distance traveled by actuator element <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> while indicating the position of filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> To remove filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from within the patient, embodiments of the present invention provide a capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is adapted to enclose filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to prevent filter from tearing or catching on stents, grafts, other implants, guide members, catheters, sheaths, or other protrusions that may be encountered as filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is removed from the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has a generally elongate form having a lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> extending from a distal end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to a proximal end <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> thereof. Disposed at distal end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is at least one radiopaque marker or band <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that aids a physician or clinician in placing capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the desired location relative to filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Through viewing the insertion of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> through a fluoroscope, a physician or clinician can place distal end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to surround filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and substantially completely enclose filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The inside diameter of lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is configured to engage with struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when they are in the open configuration, i.e., filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in the deployed position, and push struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> radially together to close opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Through this configuration, opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is closed before distal end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> contacts filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the engagement of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> with filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not cause embolic material to escape from within filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is advanced over filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is compressed into lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. To limit the amount of compression of the embolic material within filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a section of lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which or that optionally has greater elasticity than the remainder of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the border of this section being represented by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. By so doing, this portion of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can expand around filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and any captured embolic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can have various configurations and be fabricated from a variety of different materials. For example, capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from metals, alloys, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, composites, or other medical grade materials. Further, capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be kink resistant, biocompatible, radiopaque, in whole or in part, and capable of being exchanged over guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the elasticity of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be constant along its length, variable along its length, constant along a portion and variable along another portion of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, disposed at proximal end <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The locking mechanism <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> engages with the proximal end of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to securely capture guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when distal end <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> partially or completely surrounds filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). In one configuration, locking mechanism <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is an annular clamp that can be rotated to clamp a proximal end of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, locking mechanism <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can be a rotating hemostatis valve through which is disposed the proximal end of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In still another configuration, locking mechanism <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can be a locking jaw-set, such as a mechanical collett. Each of these locking mechanisms can be configured in a variety of different manners and fabricated from a variety of different materials as known to those skilled in the art. For instance, the locking mechanism can be fabricated from plastics, polymers, metals, synthetic materials, alloys, or various other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally used with a fluoroscope that enables a physician to view the insertion of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the tortuous anatomy of a patient. To enable filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be visible to the physician, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes radiopaque bands, markers, or other means for radiopacity that provide reference points for the physician. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, various locations are illustrated as being radiopaque by reference letter R. As shown, tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is radiopaque. More specifically, the most distal portion of distal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is radiopaque so that the physician knows the location of tip <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The distal end of actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is radiopaque so that the physician knows whether filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the stored, deployed, or retrieved position, while distal end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a radiopaque marker that defines the most distal portion of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Similarly, capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can include radiopaque bands, other markers, or means for radiopacity to define the distal end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In addition to the distal ends of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, embodiments of the present invention include radiopaque markers or other means for radiopacity at the junction of struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a physician can view the location of opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> during the procedure and verify that opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is closed before the physician retrieves filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the procedure is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Although reference is made to placing radiopaque bands or markers at various locations on the components of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, one skilled in the art can identify various other locations where radiopaque bands, markers, or other means for radiopacity are appropriate. Further, embodiments of the present invention need not include all discussed radiopaque bands or markers, but rather can include one or more of the described radiopaque bands or markers as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Following hereinafter is a discussion of an illustrative manner by which a filter device of one embodiment of present invention is inserted into a carotid artery. Although reference is made to the present invention being inserted into a carotid artery, it can be understood by one skilled in the art that different methods can by used to insert the filter device of the present invention into any blood vessel within a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, initially, a small needle is used to gain femoral access, as represented by block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This small hole is subsequently dilated until the hole is large enough to allow the insertion of an introducer of appropriate size as known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, it can be understood by one skilled in the art, that a variety of different access sites can be used. For example, the right subclavian artery <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, left subclavian artery <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, right brachial artery <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, left brachial artery <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, right femoral artery <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, left femoral artery <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, right radial artery and left radial arteries <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, or any other artery as by one skilled in the art can be used to enter a patient&apos;s arterial circulation. Alternatively, as known by one skilled in the art, any other blood vessel selectable by the physician can be chosen as an access site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, following insertion of the introducer, a guidewire <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is inserted into the femoral access site and steered, under fluoroscopy, to the desired location in the arterial system, just proximal to the lesion to be treated, as represented by block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In this illustrative example, the following discussion relates to stenting of a lesion in the internal carotid artery, as referenced by arrow D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Guidewire <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and guide catheter <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are advanced together incrementally until the distal tip of guidewire <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is placed proximal to the lesion, as represented by block <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Upon placing guide catheter <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, guidewire <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is removed and filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is advanced through guide catheter <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, as represented by block <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is carefully advanced through the lesion to a point distal to the lesion and subsequently acts as an exchange guidewire with a filter attached. Alternatively, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can function as guide member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> so that a physician need not exchange filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for guidewire <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In such a configuration, the steps of placing the filter device and accessing the lesion can be performed simultaneously. This particular configuration is useful because it limited the number of exchanges performed by the physician and consequently accelerates the performance of the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Once in position, moving actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> distally actuates filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and deploys filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as represented by block <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In this manner, filter assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is deployed from lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> expand to secure proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter against the wall of the vessel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Alternatively, when struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed from the same material as filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the flow of blood through the vessel causes proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to become secured against the wall of the vessel. Consequently, in either case, the blood flowing through the lesion subsequently flows through filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Next, a stent is placed over the lesion, as represented by block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This may be preceded by advancing a pre-dilation balloon <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, such as a relatively long, high-pressure balloon, over filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, shown in dotted lines, until balloon <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is within the lesion. Next, balloon <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is inflated to dilate the lesion, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and then deflated and removed from the patient. Then a stent delivery system is advanced over guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until a stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, is within the lesion. The stent delivery system deploys stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, which then expands to fit the interior of the lesion within the artery. Once stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is thus deployed, the stent delivery system is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> To secure stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> in place, a post-dilation balloon, having a similar configuration to the pre-dilation balloon, is advanced over filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the balloon is within stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the post-dilation balloon is inflated to a pressure and held at the desired pressure for a period selected by the physician. The maintenance of the balloon at such a pressure for this period causes stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> to be imbedded into the inner wall of the vessel. Following imbedding stent <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> into the inner wall of the vessel, the balloon is deflated and removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> To complete the procedure, the devices within the patient and punctured vessel and tissue are closed. With respect to filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, locking mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is activated to cause actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to move in the proximal direction. The actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> draws struts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby causing proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to be retained within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and represented by block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In another configuration, activating actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> causes proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to contact distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while remaining external from lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In either case, the material captured within filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are enclosed and prevented from escaping during removal of filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By locating proximal end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> within lumen <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or in contact distal end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> securely encloses the material with a sufficiently low force to prevent escape of any material but not cause material to be extruded through the holes of filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Once filter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in the retracted position, capture catheter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is advanced over guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until the capture catheter encloses filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. This capture catheter is optionally locked in place with respect to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the filter system, including filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the capture catheter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are removed from the patient, as represented by block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. To complete the procedure, all remaining devices are removed from the patient and the vessel puncture is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The previously described embodiment of a filter device of the present invention is only one illustrative embodiment of the filter device. The following discussion provides various other configurations of various alternate embodiments of the filter device, including the guide member, the capture catheter and various elements of components. The following embodiments can be used in a similar manner to filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in performing the above-discussed method to insert the filter device into a carotid artery or some other body lumen. Further, the applicability of the features and functions discussed with respect to the previously discussed embodiment of the present invention are applicable to the to the following embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is another configuration or embodiment of the filter assembly and actuating assembly. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> filter device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> includes a guide member <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> having a distal end <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and a lumen <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> extending from distal end <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> toward a proximal end (not shown). In this particular configuration, a sheath and cover are excluded from guide member <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, however, a sheath and cover can be included in a similar manner to guide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Disposed within lumen <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are a filter assembly <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and an actuator <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, with associated head <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. The filter assembly <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> includes a filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, which can be similar to other filters described herein, and a plurality of struts <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> extending from filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to actuator <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> or head <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. Each strut <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes a distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, a proximal portion <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, and an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> disposed between distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and proximal portion <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. The struts <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> attach to filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> on the exterior of filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, on the interior of filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, along the edge of filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, through filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, or combinations of one or more of the proceeding. To provide additional surface area to connect each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can be configured so that distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> has a cross-sectional dimension larger than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> can have a larger surface area than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The large cross-sectional area provided by the cross-sectional dimension of distal portion <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> provides large area for bonding each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, a strong bond is created between each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and filter <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Similarly, each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can be configured so that proximal portion <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> has a cross-sectional dimension larger than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, while optionally having a similar, larger, or smaller cross-sectional dimension than distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. By having a large cross-sectional dimension and hence large surface area, each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can be securely connected to actuating member <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> or head <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> which can be similar to other actuating members and heads described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> By varying the cross-sectional dimensions of distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, and/or proximal portion <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, the degree of bias exerted by each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> to move distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> toward the wall of a blood vessel can be varied. The biasing force can also be changed through optionally varying the length of each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and/or changing the curvature of each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Although reference is made herein to each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> having the above-referenced configurations, one skilled in the art can appreciate that one or more of struts <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can be configured as described above. Further, each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can optionally be configured differently so that each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can have similar or dissimilar biasing forces compared to others struts <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of the same filter device. Through varying the biasing forces, the filter device can be used for a variety of different procedures or blood vessel configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Struts <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can be formed from Nitinol, stainless steel, metals, alloys, composites, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. Each strut <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can have a generally curved distal portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, proximal portion <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, and/or intermediate portion <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, illustrated is an alternate embodiment of actuator assembly, designated by reference number <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. This particular embodiment of actuator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is capable of deploying and retrieving a filter assembly with use of a clamp assembly <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, actuating assembly <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> includes an actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, and an actuating member <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, each of which can be similar to other actuating elements and actuating members described herein. Actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> includes a distal end <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> that is configured to cooperate with guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, which can be similar to the other guide members described herein, while a proximal end <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> of actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is attached to proximal end of actuating member <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. The distal end <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> has a step configuration and includes protrusions <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> that are configured to cooperate with complementary indentations <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> formed in guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. As actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is moved in the distal direction, such as by a physician, clinician, or a device operated by the physician, clinician, or technician, protrusions <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and indentations <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> mate to position actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> in a desired location relative to proximal end <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, thereby positioning filter assembly <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> in a selected position, such as in the retracted position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is continually moved in the distal direction, distal end <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> meets a wall <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> formed in guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> that prevents further movement in the distal direction. Through this configuration, actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is prevented from excessive longitudinal displacement in the distal direction. This stopping of the longitudinal displacement of actuating element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> indicates that filter assembly <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, actuator element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> engages with clamp assembly <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. The clamp assembly <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> includes two annular clamp sets <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>. Clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> couples to actuator element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, while clamp set <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> couples to guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In this illustrative embodiment, clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> is capable of being translated along the longitudinal axis of the filter device, while clamp set <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> is fixed. Clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> can be connected to a threaded screw, hydraulic rams, pneumatic rams, slide systems, linear actuators, combinations thereof, or the like that enables clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> to move in the proximal and distal directions. For instance, in one embodiment a threaded screw is rotatably attached to clamp set <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>, with clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> mounted thereto. Upon rotating the threaded screw, clamp set <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> advances along the threaded screw in either the proximal or distal direction to open or retract the filter assembly (not shown) of the filter device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Generally, clamp assembly <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can include a variety of different clamp sets, whether annular or opposed clamping jaws or clamp set, or the like as known to one skilled in the art. Further, clamp assembly <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can use pneumatics, hydraulics, electricity, combinations thereof, or the like to move actuator element <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> and/or guide member <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, another illustrative embodiment of the present invention is depicted. As shown, a guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, which can be similar to the other guide member described herein, has a distal end <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a proximal end <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, and a lumen <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> extending from distal end <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> to proximal end <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. A tip <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, such as three or more struts. Each strut <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> can be biased such that a distal end thereof is biased to move outwardly from the longitudinal axis of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> At least one strut, designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, is biased toward the longitudinal axis of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. Disposed upon strut portion <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, as more clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, is a coil tip <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> that is commonly used with guidewires. This coil tip <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, either alone or in combination with strut <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, may be configured to allow a physician or clinician to shape the same before insertion into a body lumen. In this manner, the physician or clinician is able to configure the tip with an appropriately shaped J that enables guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to be guided through the tortuous anatomy of a patient. The coil tip <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> can be platinum, platinum alloys, radiopaque materials, metals, alloys, plastic, polymer, synthetic material, combinations thereof, or other materials that provide an appropriate radiopaque signature, while capable of being shaped, whether alone or in combination with strut <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, by a physician or clinician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Attached to the distal ends of two or more of struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is a filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. As shown, filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is disposed within lumen <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. In alternate embodiments, filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can surround guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> or partially surround and partially be contained within lumen <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. Filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can have a variety of different configuration such as those described with respect to the other filters described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be attached to guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> via a variety of different techniques and methods as known to one skilled in the art. For instance, filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be attached through adhesives, solvent bonding, thermal bonding, mechanical connections, or some other manner that is capable of securely connecting filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to one or more of struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, a distal end of two or more struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> can include respective holes (not shown) through which strands of filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be passed and attached to strut <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to connect filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Alternately, the strands can be tied in a knot or folded back upon filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and woven into or affixed to filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> To maintain struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> in the closed position, i.e., not extending outwardly from guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, a catheter <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> surrounds guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The catheter can extend completely or partially from the distal end to the proximal end of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Illustratively, the catheter can surround substantially only struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The catheter <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> acts as a restraining member or mechanism that applies a force against the struts to prevent the struts from extending outwardly. Catheter <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> can have a lumen (not shown) that has an inside diameter that is sufficiently similar to the outside diameter of guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> that struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> are restrained from extending outwardly. Through moving guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> with respect to catheter <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, or vice versa, the distal ends of two or more of struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> are allowed to move outwardly to deploy filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> that depicts guide member <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> having two struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Retracting filter <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and catheter <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> can be performed in a similar manner to that described with respect to the other filter devices discussed herein, such as but not limited to using a capture catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the catheter can extend completely or partially the length of the guide member. In another configuration, the catheter can be replaced with a sleeve, a band, or other structure that partially extends toward the proximal end of the guide member from the distal end. These sleeves, bands, or other structures can be radiopaque or include one or more radiopaque markers. Furthermore, these sleeves, bands, or other structures can be slidable relative to the guide member using an actuating member that is disposed on the exterior of the guide member, within the lumen of the guide member, or partially within the lumen and partially on the exterior of the guide member. The actuator member can be any of the actuator members described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> According to an alternate configuration of the present invention, a filter device <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> includes a guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> with a plurality of struts <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> disposed at a distal end <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> thereof. These struts <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> can be maintained in the closed position using a sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> acts as a restraining member or mechanism that applies a force against the struts to prevent the struts from extending outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> surrounds struts <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, and a filter <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, which can be similar to other filters described herein, when filter <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is located on an exterior surface of guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. Disposed within sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> or between sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and/or filter <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> are one or more actuating members or actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>. These actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> are attached to guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> at a location just proximal to the proximal end of each struts <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, identified by letter E, extend distally to the distal end of sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, and subsequently extend proximally on the outside of sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> to terminate at an actuating. element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> of an actuating assembly <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) via one or more holes <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> and lumen <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. Since one end of each actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> is located at the proximal end of sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, whether forming part of sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, attached to sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, attached to guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, or combinations thereof, pulling actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> in the proximal direction by actuating element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> of actuating assembly <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) causes actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> to preferentially separate sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> into one or more portions, thereby releasing struts <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Stated another way, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, one or more of actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> can cooperate with an actuating assembly <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and connect to actuating element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, such as through soldering, adhesives, or other forms of attachment. The actuating element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> can be moved in the proximal direction until a stop member <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight> formed in a proximal end <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> of actuating element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> engages with a stop member <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight> in guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. During the movement from a distal end <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> of actuating element <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> cooperating with a surface <highlight><bold>678</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> to stop member <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight> engaging with stop member <highlight><bold>674</bold></highlight>, actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> moves in a proximal direction to preferentially separate sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> can be formed from a variety of different materials, so long as the material is sufficiently strong to secure struts <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, while being configured to preferentially separate under the action of actuating member or actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>. For example, sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from heat shrink synthetic material, including but not limited to, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terphthalate (PET), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PU) or silicone tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> can be formed from a variety of different materials, so long as the material used is sufficiently strong to allow an actuating mechanism, such as those actuating mechanisms disclosed herein, to move actuating members or actuating member <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> proximally without breaking the same. For example, actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from plastics, polymers, metals, composites, alloys, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Instead of using actuating members <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>, embodiments of the present invention can employ various other manners to preferentially separate sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. For example, sleeve <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> can have dissolvable chemical bonds which dissolve due to a chemical reaction with the fluid in the vessel within which the filter device is disposed, bonds that are broken through applying resistive heating, ultrasonic or radio frequency energy, preferential regions or zones where the material has a weaker strength than other regions or zones of the sleeve, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Following is a discussion of other methods, devices, and systems for restraining or constraining one or more struts attached to or integrally formed as part of a guide member. The embodiments provide methods, devices, and systems for, applying a restraining force to one or more struts and subsequently releasing the same to allow the struts to expand outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, depicted is a perspective view of one embodiment of a restraining member or mechanism. The restraining member or mechanism, is in the form of a sleeve <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> and associated securing member <highlight><bold>762</bold></highlight>, the combination of which is adapted to surround one or more struts <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> of a guide member <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and apply a restraining force against struts <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> to maintain struts <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> in a closed configuration. The sleeve <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> includes a first side <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> and a second side <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight> with first and second sides <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight> being separated by an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> surrounds guide member <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> in such a manner that intermediate portion <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> surrounds guide member <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> so that portions of intermediate portion <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> contacts with, are juxtaposed to, are contiguous with, or are adjacent one to another. The securing member <highlight><bold>762</bold></highlight> passes through such portions of intermediate portion <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> to secure sleeve <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> upon guide member <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. To further aid with applying a restraining force against struts <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight>, first side <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> and second side <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight> are folded to attach to respective portions of outside surface of sleeve <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The process of forming the restraining member or mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</cross-reference>.

To provide additional surface area to connect each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>, each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can be configured so that distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> has a cross-sectional dimension larger than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> can have a larger surface area than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight>. The large cross-sectional area provided by the cross-sectional dimension of distal portion <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> provides large area for bonding each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> to filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, a strong bond is created between each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> and filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Similarly, each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can be configured so that proximal portion <highlight><bold>1266</bold></highlight> has a cross-sectional dimension larger than intermediate portion <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight>, while optionally having a similar, larger, or smaller cross-sectional dimension than distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. By having a large cross-sectional dimension and hence large surface area, each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can apply a greater biasing force to extend strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> outwardly to deploy filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> By varying the cross-sectional dimensions of distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>, intermediate portion <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight>, and/or proximal portion <highlight><bold>1266</bold></highlight>, the degree of bias exerted by each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> to move distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> toward the wall of a blood vessel can be varied. The biasing force can also be changed through optionally varying the length of each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> and/or changing the curvature of each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Although reference is made herein to each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> having the above-referenced configurations, one skilled in the art can appreciate that one or more of struts <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can be configured as described above. Further, each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can optionally be configured differently so that each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can have similar or dissimilar biasing forces compared to others struts <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> of the same filter device. Through varying the biasing forces, the filter device can be used for a variety of different procedures or blood vessel configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Struts <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can be formed from Nitinol, stainless steel, metals, alloys, composites, plastics, polymers, synthetic materials, or combinations thereof. Each strut <highlight><bold>1252</bold></highlight> can have a generally curved distal portion <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>, proximal portion <highlight><bold>1266</bold></highlight>, and/or intermediate portion <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Disposed with lumen <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight> at distal end <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight> is a core <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> forming part of an atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. Surrounding at least a portion of core <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> is a coil <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight> that provides flexibility and radiopaque properties to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. The core <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> passes through an aperture <highlight><bold>1266</bold></highlight> in a distal end of filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, core <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> passes through one or more pores formed in filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> To secure filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>, a securing coil <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> surrounds a portion of coil <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight> and the distal end of filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. Although this is one manner to connect filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>, one skilled in the art can identify various other manners to connect filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. For instance, the distal end of filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> can be bonded to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> using adhesives, mechanical fasteners, crimping, seals, friction fit, press fit, or other manners to connect filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. In another configuration, filter <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> is not connected to atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> but can slide along a portion of atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, another illustrative embodiment of the present invention is depicted. The majority of the features previously discussed with respect to other embodiments of the present invention apply to this exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> A filter assembly <highlight><bold>1342</bold></highlight> comprises a filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> and a spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight>. Filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of struts <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight>. These struts <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> are lengthened strands of filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. These struts <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> connect filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> to actuating member <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> and are unbiased. Alternatively, struts <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> can be biased to open filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Disposed at proximal end <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, is biased spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight>. Biased spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> has a coil-type configuration and includes a proximal end <highlight><bold>1368</bold></highlight> that extends into lumen <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight> to be attached to actuating member <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>, such as similar to actuating member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> discussed herein, and/or a head <highlight><bold>1344</bold></highlight>. Spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> is biased to an opened position where spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> forms opening <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight>. During deployment of filter assembly <highlight><bold>1342</bold></highlight>, the flow of blood through the blood vessel applies a force to filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. This force enables filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> to be withdrawn from lumen <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> and become deployed into the form described herein. Since spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> is biased to open, spring member <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> draws the outer peripheral edge of filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> at proximal end <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight> toward the inner wall of the blood vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> To retract filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, actuating member <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> is moved in the proximal direction, causing proximal end <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight> of filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> to be drawn proximally. This causes proximal end <highlight><bold>1358</bold></highlight> to be drawn toward lumen <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> and become closed, thereby enabling filter <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> to be removed through the procedure discussed herein, such as through use of a capture catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Various configurations of capture catheter are known to those skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. The capture catheters described herein can be used with any of the embodiments of the filter device or guide member described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> an alternate embodiment of a capture catheter, designated by reference number <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight> is illustrated. As shown, capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight> includes a distal portion <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight> and a positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight> connected or attached to distal portion <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight>. The distal portion <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight> includes a lumen <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> extending from a distal end <highlight><bold>1396</bold></highlight> to terminate at an aperture <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> at a proximal end <highlight><bold>1398</bold></highlight> thereof. The distal end <highlight><bold>1396</bold></highlight> optionally includes a radiopaque marker or band <highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight>, while lumen <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> is configured to receive a filter assembly of a filter device in a similar manner to lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, lumen <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> can include a stop member <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>, depicted in dotted lines, with a hole <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> therethrough. The stop member <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> allows guide member <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> to pass through hole <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight>, but prevents a filter assembly disposed at a distal end of guide member <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> to pass through hole <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> once capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight> has received the filter assembly within lumen <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. One skilled in the art can identify various other configurations of stop member. For instance, hole <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> can be disposed in stop member <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> at any location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> To move capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight> along guide member <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> of the filter device, capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight> includes positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight>. This positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight> has sufficient stiffness that application of a force at a proximal end <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight> can be transferred to longitudinal motion of distal portion <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight> is a solid member, while in another configuration positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight> is hollow or has at least a portion thereof hollow. The positioning member <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a polymer, a plastic, polymer, a synthetic material, a metal, an alloy, combinations thereof, or other material that can be used for medical devices and has the needed stiffness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> an alternate embodiment of a capture catheter, designated by reference number <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> is illustrated. As shown, capture catheter <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> includes a distal end <highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight> and a lumen <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight> extending from distal end <highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight> to terminate at an aperture <highlight><bold>1426</bold></highlight> at a location proximal to distal end <highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight>. Lumen <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight> is configured to receive a filter assembly of a filter device in a similar manner to lumen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, while aperture <highlight><bold>1426</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive guide member <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> and prevent passage of filter assembly of the filter device. In this configuration, the length of lumen <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight> is configured to prevent capture catheter <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> from being advanced further over the filter device or filter assembly of the filter device than is required. Alternatively, lumen <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight> can include a stop member similar to stop member <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> discussed herein. Furthermore, capture catheter <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> can optionally include one or more radiopaque markers disposed at and/or between a distal end and a proximal end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>, depicted is another embodiment of a capture catheter in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. As illustrated, capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight> is adapted to cooperate with a filter device <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>. The illustrative filter device <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> includes a filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> coupled to a distal end <highlight><bold>1514</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>. The filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight> and a filter connected to one or more of the plurality of struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight>. As shown, filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> is a separate component that is attached, connected, or coupled to guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>. In an alternate configuration, however, filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> can be integrally formed with guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>, such that each of the plurality of struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight> is formed from a portion of guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight>. Also forming part of filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> is an atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight>. This atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight> can be disposed through filter <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight> of filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, atraumatic tip <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight> can pass around filter <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight>, as depicted in dotted lines, and be configured from one of the plurality of struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight> that elongated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Returning to capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight>, the capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight> includes a distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight> and a proximal portion <highlight><bold>1494</bold></highlight> that communicates with the distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight>. The proximal portion <highlight><bold>1494</bold></highlight> is stiffer than the distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight> and can have a similar configuration to the other capture catheters described herein. For instance, proximal portion <highlight><bold>1494</bold></highlight> can be capture catheter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, can have a similar configuration to distal portion <highlight><bold>1392</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>1390</bold></highlight>, or can be capture catheter <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>. The distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight> is flexible and tapers from proximal to proximal portion <highlight><bold>1494</bold></highlight> to a distal end <highlight><bold>1498</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Disposed at distal end <highlight><bold>1498</bold></highlight> is a lumen <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> that receives guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>. Lumen <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> can be formed from a separate tubular member that is connected, attached, or coupled to the distal end of capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, lumen <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> can be formed from the distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight> of capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight>. The lumen <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> is adapted to slidably receive guide member <highlight><bold>1512</bold></highlight> of filter device <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, but prevent passage of filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> has an outer diameter greater than the inner diameter of lumen <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. Consequently, as capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight> is moved in a distal direction, distal end <highlight><bold>1498</bold></highlight> engages with either a proximal end of filter assembly <highlight><bold>1542</bold></highlight> or one or more of the extending struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight>. As capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight> continues to be advanced, distal portion <highlight><bold>1492</bold></highlight>, due to its flexibility, begins to invert, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>. As capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight> is continued to be advanced, struts <highlight><bold>1552</bold></highlight> and filter <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight> are completely enclosed within capture catheter <highlight><bold>1490</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
