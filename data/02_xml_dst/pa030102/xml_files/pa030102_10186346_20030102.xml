<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of electronic circuits, and, more particularly, to programmable logic devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Configurable memories are embedded in field programmable logic devices to provide on-chip fast random access memory (RAM). There are two types of memory resources commercially available, which are illustratively shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The first is the lookup table (LUT) type, which are found inside logic blocks <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. These may be combined in various configurations to provide memories of varying widths and depths, such as in the Xilinx XC4000 and Virtex devices, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One drawback of such distributed memory resources is that the large memory formed by combining these resources may be relatively slow. Moreover, one has to provide read/write control circuitry for all of the LUTs. Further, if these LUTs are not used to implement memory, then the read/write control circuitry associated therewith is wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The second type of on-chip memory resource includes large &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; of RAM bits <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as those provided by Xilinx and Altera. These can be configured to provide memories with varying widths and depths. Yet, one drawback associated with using blocks of RAM bits is that if a block (e.g., 4 k) is used to implement a small memory (e.g., 512&times;2)), then a significant amount of unused RAM bits (i.e., 3 K) will be wasted. Moreover, if a logical memory supports an odd width (e.g., 256&times;9), then even more resources are wasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,547 describes embedded memory structures of the same type which may be combined and configured independently. As such, these memory structures may similarly suffer from the above-described drawbacks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a field programmable logic device including at least two independently configurable embedded memory structures. The memory structures differ in parameters such as memory size, available configuration depths, and/or available configuration widths to provide for a more efficient memory utilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the memory structures may provide mutually exclusive configuration options in at least one configuration parameter. The memory structures may be combined to form larger configurations through interconnection of dedicated memory routing tracks and horizontal routing channels, where the dedicated memory routing tracks may include a plurality of bus-based vertical tracks originating from memory I/Os. Further, horizontal routing channels may include several routing tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The dedicated memory routing track may interact with the horizontal routing channels through programmable switches. In addition, a single set of dedicated memory routing tracks may span one or more memory blocks and a plurality of horizontal routing channels. The upper and lower end of the dedicated memory routing tracks may be a set of bus-based bi-directional programmable buffers to connect different blocks of memory to form deeper and/or wider memories. Since each memory structure supports a subset of total configuration modes available, the size of the multiplexer at the input/output of the memories may be reduced to enhance the speed of access to the memories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the memory structures may be used independently or in combination to implement logic functions. The memory structures may also be multiport structures, and may be implemented as read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), content addressable memory (CAM), and first in first out (FIFO) structures, for example.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, two or more types of memory resources are provided where the two types are distinguishable by the configuration modes they support, their size, or both. For ease of understanding, consider two types of memory resources. In one embodiment, the different memory structures can be distinguished both on the basis of the configuration modes they support and their sizes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The programmable logic device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes three types of programmable resources <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are programmable memory blocks with wider configurable data widths and/or larger core sizes than the components <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are programmable memory blocks with smaller configurable data widths and/or smaller core sizes than the components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are programmable logic blocks that can be any of a PLA or LUT based circuit to implement logic intensive circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The components <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> support small memory requirements (memory size) with a plurality of smaller configurable word sizes, e.g., x1, x2, and x4. The smaller configurable memory arrays can be combined using dedicated (bus-based) as well as general routing resources to create wider or deeper memories. The components <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> support large memory requirements (memory size) with a plurality of larger configurable word sizes, e.g., x8, x16, and x32. The larger memory arrays can also be combined using separate dedicated (bus-based) as well as general routing resources to create wider or deeper memories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since each memory structure is supporting only a subset of the total configuration modes available, the size of the multiplexer at the input/output of the memories will be reduced. Reduced flexibility at each level enhances the speed of operation at both levels, though it does not affect the overall number of possible combinations of different word sizes available. As the configuration modes supported by both types of memory structures are mutually exclusive, they do not interact with each other and no separate routing resources between the two types of memory structures are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if the size of the smaller memory structure is 256 bits and that of the larger memory structure is 2 Kbits (implying that the smaller memory can implement any of 256&times;1, 128&times;2 or 64&times;4 and the larger memory can implement any of 256&times;8, 128&times;16 or 64&times;32), then x9, x18, x36 modes can also be easily realized as the memory depth in both the memory structures is the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One such implementation is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Here, a 256&times;9 logical memory is implemented, as may be required in certain designs. In this implementation, one memory block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and one memory block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are combined to form a memory block of a size 256&times;9. The memory block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is configured in 256&times;1 mode, i.e., this memory has 256 words of 1 bit each. To address 256 words, this memory requires 8 address lines <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and its output data bus <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, is 1 bit wide. The memory block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is configured in 256&times;8 mode, which means that this memory has <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> words of 8 bits each. To address 256 words, this memory requires 8 address lines <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and its output data bus <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is 8 bits wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now, to create a 256&times;9 memory block, the blocks <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are combined in the following manner. The address buses of blocks <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, i.e., <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, are shorted. The short connection is provided through routing segments and programmable connections, as illustratively shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The output data buses of both the blocks together, i.e., <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, provide the data bus <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of 256&times;9 memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An exemplary memory to memory and memory to logic interaction scheme in accordance with the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The memory block (any of blocks <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) interacts with the logic blocks <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and other memory blocks through dedicated memory routing tracks and horizontal routing channels. The dedicated memory routing tracks <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>include a plurality of bus-based vertical tracks (originating from memory I/Os) that interact with horizontal routing channels <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> through programmable switches <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The horizontal routing tracks in turn interact with logic blocks. The horizontal routing channels also include several routing tracks. The dedicated memory routing tracks interact with horizontal routing channels through programmable switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A single set of dedicated memory routing tracks spans one (or more) memory block and a plurality of horizontal routing channels. At the upper and lower ends of the dedicated memory routing tracks are a set of bus-based, bi-directional programmable buffers <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> that help to connect different blocks of memories to form deeper and/or wider memories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The connection box where the dedicated memory routing tracks interact with the horizontal routing channels is called the memory logic interface (designated <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The interconnections between memory blocks and logic blocks are made possible with this memory logic interface box. It should be noted that the attached figure is only a schematic representation. In actual connections the number of address and data lines may be larger than shown in the figure. Also, the number of tracks in the horizontal channel and the topology of switches in the memory logic interface box could be different as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the different memory structures may differ based upon the configuration modes supported thereby, but they have the same size. In yet another embodiment, different memory structures may have different sizes, but they support the same configuration modes. Another possibility is that both, or any one of, the memories can be used in asynchronous ROM mode to implement logic when the design does not require all the on-chip memory resources that are provided. As such, this will save LUTs in all the cases considered above. Of course, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above teachings may be extended to more than two types of memory resources. </paragraph>
