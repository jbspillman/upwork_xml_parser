<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to projection displays and more specifically to reducing the moir&eacute; effect associated with rear-projection displays based on pixelated technologies, such as DMD, LCD, LCOS, etc. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The typical screen technology in rear projection displays utilizes a special dark-stripe structure to improve the ambient light rejection, which effectively provides a higher contrast display. This dark-stripe structure is simply an array of blackened vertical stripes, separated by regions allowing light to pass through. These regions allowing light to pass through, whether they may be transparent, translucent, diffuse, or another type of structure, will be referred to herein as clear stripes or simply stripes or structures allowing light to pass. For CRT based displays these screens work fine. However for pixelated (digital) displays, which utilize digital spatial light modulators (SLM) such as the micromirror device (DMD) or LCD technology, the current dark-stripe structure can interfere optically with the pixelated structure of the SLMs, causing interference fringes known as moir&eacute; patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are top and front drawings, respectively, of a typical dark-stripe, or dark-stripe rear-projection screen. The backside of the screen, where the projected image enters, consists of a layer of small lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The dark-stripe structure is fabricated on the opposite surface (from the lens elements) of the lenticular layer and consists of vertical black stripes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> separated by transparent (clear) stripes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Next, a diffusion layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is put on top of the dark-stripe layer to diffuse the light <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, coming through the transparent stripes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, across the entire screen <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Finally a hard coating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is applied on the outside surface of the screen for protection purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In operation, the black stripes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> tend to make the screen look dark to the viewer while still letting light pass through it. This provides adequate picture contrast for viewing in a room with ordinary lighting conditions (although not intended for use in direct sunlight). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In these display screens, the lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are optimized to direct most of the available light to a viewing spot directly in front of the screen, where a typical viewer is likely to be located. As the viewer moves away from this central viewing point, either vertically or horizontally, the brightness will gradually decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are Fourier transforms of discrete-time signals obtained by periodic sampling this continuous signal, which illustrate what causes the moir&eacute; fringes in digital displays. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the sampling period for the screen is large (low sampling rate), so that the periodic repetitions of the continuous-time transform (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) overlap. In this case, the upper frequencies in Xa(j&OHgr;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) get reflected into the lower frequencies in X(<highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&ohgr;</superscript></highlight>) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in the overlapped areas. This phenomenon, where in effect the high frequency component in the continuous time signal takes on the identity of a lower frequency, is called aliasing and causes moir&eacute; fringes to occur. On the other hand, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>the sampling period for the screen is small enough (high sampling rate) so that the periodic repetitions of the continuous time transform do not overlap and therefore moir&eacute; fringes do not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an example of the moir&eacute; effect <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This illustration involves overlaying one pixelated pattern <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> over a second pixelated pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and slightly rotating the patterns relative to each other to establish the overlapping conditions discussed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The pitch (spacing between lines) of dark-stripe screens is continuously getting smaller as screen technology advances, but so are the display pixels, so that moir&eacute; effects will continue to be a problem. What is needed is a method to provide a step-function improvement to overcome this problem. The disclosed invention accomplishes this by rotating the dark-stripe structure relative to the displayed pixels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention discloses a method for reducing the moir&eacute; effect in rear-projection displays by rotating the dark-stripe structure in the screen 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the vertical axis of the display. By rotating the black stripes relative to the display pixels, the spatial frequency at which the moir&eacute; effect sets in can be improved by 15% to 41%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To prevent the moir&eacute; phenomenon from occurring, the Nyquist rate of the screen structure must be less than one-half the pixel rate (as imaged on the screen); that is, the projected pixel pitch is greater than twice the screen structure pitch. The method of this invention extends the ratio of the projected pixel pitch to screen structure pitch by a factor of up to 1.41. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The lenticular lens elements on the input surface of the screen can be shaped to match the angle of the opening between dark-stripes to maintain a high brightness level in the center of the screen that decreases in the normal sense as the viewer moves in either the vertical or horizontal directions, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This method extends the use of existing lower-cost dark-stripe screens to provide high performance displays with reduced moir&eacute; interference and as screen technology advances with finer dark-stripe pitch, will continue to provide between 15% and 41% improvement over conventional vertical stripe screens.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This invention discloses a method for reducing the moir&eacute; effect in rear-projection displays by rotating the dark-stripe structure in the screen 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the displayed pixels or the axes of the display. By rotating the dark-stripes relative to the displayed pixels, the spatial frequency at which the moir&eacute; effect sets in can be improved by 15% to 41%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are drawings showing the top and front views of the dark-stripe rear-projection screen of the present invention, where the dark-stripe structure is rotated 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the axes of the screen. The backside of the screen where the projected image enters, consists of a layer of small lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The dark-stripe structure is fabricated on the opposite surface (from the lens elements) of the lenticular layer and consists of diagonal black stripes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> separated by transparent (clear) stripes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. However, in this case the dark-stripe structure is rotated from 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the vertical axis of the screen. Next, a diffusion layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is fabricated on top of the rotated dark-stripe layer to diffuse the light <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, coming through the transparent stripes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, across the entire screen <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. Finally a hard coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is applied on the outside surface of the screen for protection purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In operation, the rotated black stripes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> tend to make the screen look dark to the viewer while still letting light pass through it. This provides adequate picture contrast for viewing in a room having ordinary lighting conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In these display screens the lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are optimized to direct most of the available light to a viewing spot directly in front of the screen, where a typical viewer is likely to be located. However, in this case the maximum roll-off in brightness will occur as the viewer moves away from this central viewing point in a diagonally manner. Although this has proven to be acceptable, the lenticular lens elements can be shaped to cause the maximum brightness roll-off to occur in the vertical and horizontal directions, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To prevent moir&eacute; patterns from occurring in dark-stripe rear-projection screens the conditions stated in the following equation must exist: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Projected Pixel Pitch&gE;2&times; Screen Structure Pitch, where screen structure pitch is defined as the distance between black stripes on the screen and projected pixel pitch as the distance between the projector&apos;s pixels as imaged on the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another way of saying this is that since the screen pitch must be &lE;one-half the projected pixel pitch, then the sampling rate (1/pitch) of the screen, generally referred to as the Nyquist rate, must be &gE;2 the projected pixel rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are drawings illustrating the projected pixel pitch vs. screen structure pitch for a conventional dark-stripe screen and the rotated dark-stripe screen of the present invention, respectively. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the projector&apos;s pixels are defined by the dark lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, while the screen&apos;s dark-stripe structure is shown by the shaded/white columns <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In this drawing, the projected pixel pitch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is 2 times the dark-stripe pitch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>; e.g., the projected pixel pitch <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be 1 mm and the dark-stripe pitch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> 0.5 mm. Therefore, the screen sampling rate is 2 times the pixel sampling rate, thereby just satisfying the Nyquist rate so that moir&eacute; patterns would not be introduced. However, since the pixel pitch of many newer Spatial Light Modulators is being reduced, the impact of moir&eacute; using the same dark-stripe screen may increase and become objectionable. As the screen&apos;s dark-stripe structure is made finer as in the case of future more expensive screens, there is greater margin before the Nyquist rate is exceeded and moir&eacute; effects become evident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the Nyquist rate can be improved for the same black-strip screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by rotating the dark-stripe structure relative to the displayed pixels. In this example, the pixels are defined by the dark lines <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the dark-stripe structure by diagonal shaded/white stripes <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which is rotated 45&deg; relative to the pixels. The dark-stripe pitch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is the same (0.5 mm) as in the earlier example, but the pixel pitch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is now 1.4 mm, or 41% greater than for the vertical stripe example. The means that a given screen has up to a 41% greater margin against moir&eacute; effects, for the rotated dark-stripe structure of the present invention, over the conventional vertical dark-stripe structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a graph showing the trigonometric relationship realized by rotating the dark-stripe structure in a rear-projection screen. In this graph, the length of lines <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> represents the pixel pitch for a conventional vertical dark-stripe screen, while the length of lines <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> represent the effective pixel pitch for the rotated dark-stripe screen of the present invention, where the structure is rotated 30&deg; <highlight><bold>5100</bold></highlight> and 45&deg; <highlight><bold>5200</bold></highlight> relative to the vertical axis or 30&deg; <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> and 45&deg; <highlight><bold>5201</bold></highlight> relative to the horizontal axis. Normalizing the length of these vectors so that lines <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> for a conventional screen is 1.0, then the length of lines <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> for the rotated dark-stripe structure of the present invention are 1.15, 1.41, and 1.15, respectively. This represents a maximum improvement in the Nyquist rate of 41% when the dark-stripe structure <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is rotated 45&deg; and 15% when rotated 30&deg; relative to either the vertical or the horizontal axis of the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The trigonometric functions to establish this improvement is given as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The lenticular lenses tend to project a majority of the available light directly in front of the center portion of the screen where the viewer&apos;s eye is normally located. As the viewer moves about, the screen brightness is observed to roll-off. For the rotated dark-stripe structure of the present invention, this roll-off will be more pronounced along the diagonals from corner-to-corner of the screen. Although this diagonal roll-off is no more objectionable than the vertical and horizontal roll-off in conventional screens, the optimization of the vertical and horizontal components is no longer preserved to maintain the original viewing angles. The lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be shaped to maintain the traditional brightness roll-off relative to the vertical and horizontal screen axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a drawing of a rear-screen projection display, which uses the rotated dark-stripe screen of the present invention. The projector is housed in a free-standing cabinet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and includes a projection engine <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a relative large turning mirror <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and the rotated black-strip rear-projection screen <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The engine <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can use any pixelated technology, although the example shown is for a digital micromirror device (DMD) projector. The engine <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is located in the lower portion of the cabinet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and uses a single DMD <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> to modulate the light. This particular configuration of the engine <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is comprised of a light source <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, which emits white light along a first light path, through a motor-driven rotating color filter wheel <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>, which provides sequential red-green-blue (R-G-B) light. This sequential light is collected by an integrating rod <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> and passed through a condensing lens <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> where it is sized to fit the aperture of a total-internal-reflective (TIR) prism <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. The light is reflected off an internal surface of the TIR prism on to the reflective mirrors of the DMD <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> where it is modulated and projected back through the TIR prism <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> along a second light path, through a projection lens <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and projected <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> (shaded area) on to the rather large turning mirror <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> positioned diagonally along the upper back surface of the cabinet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown. This sequential R-G-B light is then reflected <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight> (shaded area) off the turning mirror <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> through the rotated dark-stripe screen <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for viewing by an observer. This shows one configuration of one type engine that can be used with the screen of the present invention. Other DMD engine may not involve a TIR prism and/or an integrating rod. Other engines technologies, such as LCD, are also applicable, as are projectors using two or three spatial light modulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Typical pixel pitch at the screen for a projected image in a DMD rear-projection system is about 1.0 mm based on the projection lens <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> having a magnification of 72&times; and a 57-inch diagonal image with 16:9 aspect ratio. This corresponds to an effective pitch of 1.4 mm for the rotated dark-stripe screen of the present invention. The margin against moir&eacute; fringes will become more critical as the pixels become smaller relative to the black stripe pitch in future projection systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The dark-stripe rear-projection screen <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is that of the present invention, where the dark-stripe structure is rotated 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the displayed pixels and/or the axes of the screen. The backside of the screen, where the projected image enters, consists of a layer of small lenticular lens elements <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The dark-stripe structure is fabricated on the opposite surface (from the lens elements) of the lenticular layer and consists of diagonal black stripes <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> separated by transparent (clear) stripes <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. In this case the dark-stripe structure is rotated 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the displayed pixels. Next, a diffusion layer (not shown) is fabricated on top of the rotated dark-stripe layer to diffuse <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> the light <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight>, coming through the transparent stripes <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, across the entire screen. Finally a hard coating layer is applied on the outside surface of the screen for protection purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In operation, the projector presents sequential R-G-B images to the screen <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> at a rate sufficient that the eye integrates the image to provide a high-performance color picture. The rotated black stripes <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> tend to make the screen look dark to the viewer while still letting light pass through it. This provides adequate picture contrast for viewing in a room with ordinary lighting conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Where desirable, the lenticular lens elements can be shaped to cause the brightness roll-off in the screen to occur in the vertical and horizontal directions. This screen <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> improves the margin for preventing moir&eacute; patterns from occurring by effectively increasing the pixel pitch to screen structure pitch ratio by a factor of up to 1.41. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has thus far been discussed in terms of the preferred method of aligning the dark stripe structures of the display screen diagonally across a pixelated image formed by vertical columns and horizontal rows of pixels, it should be understood that an alternate embodiment provides vertical or horizontal-from the viewer&apos;s perspective-dark stripe structures to prevent or reduce the moir&eacute; effect when an image formed by a staggered array of pixels is projected. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show such arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an array of diamond-shaped pixels <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is provided. The diamond-shaped pixels <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are arranged in an array such that each pixel is offset in the horizontal direction from the pixels in the rows immediately above and below. A portion of the display screen <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is superimposed on the array of diamond-shaped pixels <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As in prior embodiments, the display screen is comprised of alternating clear <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and dark <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> stripe structures arranged at a rate of at least twice the horizontal pixel resolution. As in the previous embodiments, diagonal relationship between the dark screen structures <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the diagonal pixels tends to reduce the moir&eacute; effect. While the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> reduces the moir&eacute; effect, the diagonal pixels often produce noticeable jagged edges on vertical lines and therefore are often less desirable than the typical orthogonal array of pixels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> staggered array of pixels is used. The staggered array of pixels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is comprised of rows of rectangular pixels, each row offset in the horizontal direction from the rows immediately above and below. A portion of the display screen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is superimposed on the array of diamond-shaped pixels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As in prior embodiments, the display screen is comprised of alternating clear <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and dark <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> stripe structures arranged at a rate of at least twice the horizontal pixel resolution. As in the previous embodiments, diagonal relationship between the dark screen structures <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and the diagonal pixels tends to reduce the moir&eacute; effect. While the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> reduces the moir&eacute; effect, the diagonal pixels often produce noticeable jagged edges on vertical lines and therefore are often less desirable than the typical orthogonal array of pixels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> each provide pixel arrays with strong diagonal orientations. These pixel arrays form diagonal groups of pixels having abutting sides-in contrast with traditional orthogonal arrays in which diagonal pixels merely touch at the corners. By orienting the dark-structures of the display screen at an angle of 45&plusmn;15 degrees relative to the diagonal groups of pixels having abutting sides the moir&eacute; effect is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in the context of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume embodiments other than that specifically set out and described above. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
