<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to improvements in indicator attachment mechanisms for molded plastic hangers, such as garment hangers and to a method and apparatus for removing indicators from garment hangers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For purposes of displaying garments suspended on hangers in an orderly and attractive manner to the retail customer, it is often desired to affix an indicating means on the hanger in a position visible to the retail customer while the hanger is suspended on a rack. The indicating means identifies some attribute of the garment suspended from the hanger, such as size, quality, color, manufacturing data, or pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The provision of a readily visible size indicator on a garment hanger is now accepted by retailers as a desirable addition to a garment hanger. To accommodate the various types of hangers available in the industry numerous indicating means have been developed in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials. Similarly, hangers have been developed to accommodate a variety of different indicating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In Australian Patent No. 638436 and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,354, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, a low-profile molded plastic indicator for a garment hanger which requires limited modification to the hook of the hanger to enable the indicator to be securely attached to the top of the hook where it is most visible is described. The improvements described in the above patents overcame the major disadvantages of one type of indicator (trapezium-shaped) described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,322,902 which required a specially molded hook profile to support the indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The indicator according to Australian Patent No. 638436 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,354 is also designed to enable sorting into a predetermined orientation to enable automated handling and fitting of the indicators to hangers as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,272,806 and 5,285,566 which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. For these reasons, the indicator has enjoyed considerable commercial success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The indicator is retained on the hook by means of at least one abutment projecting from the hook which engages an aperture in the side wall of the indicator. While it is possible to disengage the indicator from the abutment(s) by bowing the side walls in the regions of the apertures, this is a difficult operation and often results in some damage to the indicator or to the hanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is increasingly common for customers to require that the indicator be removable from the hanger for re-use with other sized garments or re-location and the attachment mechanism described above does not readily facilitate this operation. It is, of course, equally necessary for the indicator to remain securely attached to the hanger during the usual handling operations to which the hanger is subjected in day to day use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved indicator attachment mechanism which securely fastens an indicator to a hanger but which permits removal of the indicator in a simple operation that reduces the likelihood of damage to the indicator or to the hanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention therefore provides a molded plastic hanger having an indicator attachment device, wherein the hanger has a hook formed with an upstanding web to be received within a downwardly opening cavity of a molded plastic indicator, and attachment means formed on the web to engage and releasably secure the indicator to the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the indicator has side walls formed with at least one aperture adapted to receive the attachment means. The attachment means preferably comprises a resilient detent means which is formed in said upstanding web and has a laterally projecting portion positioned to engage the side wall aperture of the indicator to prevent removal of the indicator from the hook. The resilient detent means also enables the laterally projecting portion to be disengaged from the opening to facilitate removal of the indicator from the hook without damage to the indicator or to the hook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In use, as will be described more fully below, the laterally projecting portion is disengaged from the side wall by inserting a probe or pin through the side wall aperture to displace the laterally projecting portion from the aperture to thereby release the indicator from the hook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the detent means comprises a downwardly depending leg integrally molded within a molded opening in the upstanding web and resiliently connected to the web to enable deflection of the laterally projecting portion into the plane of the web to facilitate removal of the indicator from the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a method and apparatus for removing indicators from garment hangers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method and apparatus of the present invention provide an extremely versatile arrangement which can accommodate virtually all types of indicators mounted on the hook of a hanger. The method and system can also accommodate a wide variety of hanger types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a system which includes: a first means for receiving an indicator affixed to a hanger; a second means for securing said hanger for removal of the indicator; actuating means for driving the first and second means upwardly and downwardly; and means for ejecting the indicator. After the indicator is ejected the first plate is driven downwardly to its lower position and the apparatus automatically repeats the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the first means includes a first plate defining a recess, such that the indicator affixed to the hanger is received by the recess. The first means preferably further includes a pin positioned to displace the indicator attachment mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In operation, the actuating means drives the first plate downwardly to receive the indicator in the recess and then upwardly to remove the indicator from the hanger while the hanger is secured by the second means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The hangers with indicators affixed thereto can be lined up on a feeding rail which is slanted such that the force of gravity drives the indicator affixed to the hanger into the recess. In a preferred embodiment the second means includes an edge for holding the top region of the hanger to prevent the hanger from moving when the indicator is removed by the upward movement of the first plate. In a particularly preferred embodiment the second means includes a plate which is driven downwardly to separate the hanger undergoing the decapping process from the rest of the hangers on the feeding rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The first plate of the present embodiment includes a milled out portion defining a recess substantially corresponding to the shape and dimensions of the indicator such that when the first plate is in its lower position gravity forces the foremost indicator into the recess. The first plate also includes a pin extending from the recess in a position corresponding to the indicator attachment mechanism on the hanger. When the indicator engages the recess of the first plate the pin thereby displaces the indicator attachment mechanism to release the indicator from the hanger. It will be noted that the pin can be positioned in any of several positions provided the configuration of the recess conforms substantially to the exterior dimensions of the indicator. Thus, the system of the present invention is easily adapted to accommodate a variety of indicator configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To remove the indicator from the hanger the first plate is driven upwardly by, for instance, pneumatic cylinder means, when the indicator is resting in the recess of the first plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The system further contemplates ejection of the indicator from the recess of the first plate. In one embodiment an aperture is defined in the first plate and the ejection means generates an air blast that passes through the aperture to eject the indicator from the recess. In a preferred embodiment the second means further includes a second plate having a window through which the indicator passes, upon ejection. The window can be dimensioned to accommodate a variety of indicator configurations. A discharge tube can be attached to said second plate such that upon ejection the indicator is removed from the decapping apparatus and collected in a separate device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a device for manually removing an indicator from a hanger with an indicator attachment mechanism. In a preferred embodiment the device includes a plate with at least one recess for receiving at least a portion of the indicator. The device further includes a pin positioned within the recess such that when the indicator rests in the recess the pin releases the indicator attachment mechanism. In a particularly preferred embodiment the indicator attachment mechanism comprises a resilient detent leg as discussed above which the pin depresses to release the indicator from the hanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The device for manually removing the indicators from hangers can include through-holes for mounting to a support such that the operator need not handle the device while manually decapping the hangers. The device can further include more than a single recess and pin such that the device can be used in more than one orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for removing an indicator from a hanger by inserting a pin defined on a first plate into the indicator to displace the indicator attachment mechanism and thereby release the indicator from the indicator attachment mechanism. The method can be performed either manually or automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The automated method for removing the indicator from the garment hanger comprises: holding a plurality of hangers with indicators affixed thereto; selectively engaging one of the indicators; displacing the indicator attachment mechanism and removing the indicator from the hanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the method comprises selectively engaging and receiving the indicator affixed to a hanger in a recess of a first plate; inserting a pin included in the first plate into the indicator to displace the indicator attachment mechanism, and removing said indicator from the hanger by carrying the indicator upwardly in the first plate. In a second embodiment the method further contemplates moving the first plate upwardly and aligning said recess with indicator therein with a window in a second plate and ejecting the indicator from the recess through the window into a discharge tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Before the indicator is selectively engaged the second plate can be driven upwardly to permit the indicator affixed to the garment hanger to advance along a feeding rail and rest in the recess in the first plate and then downwardly to prevent a second indicator affixed to a second hanger in the plurality of hangers with indicators from advancing. After the indicator is disengaged from the hanger the second plate is moved upwardly to permit the second indicator affixed to the second hanger to advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present method the step of displacing the indicator attachment mechanism contemplates depressing a resilient detent leg included in the indicator attachment mechanism with a pin on the first plate to release the indicator from the hanger.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS: </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now in detail to the drawings, and to the embodiments depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, there is illustrated generally a hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adapted to engage a rod or other supporting means, with an upwardly projecting web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extending upwardly above the top contour <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that engages the rod or other supporting device. An opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is defined in said upwardly projecting web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that upwardly projecting web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> completely surrounds opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Leg <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> descends from an upper portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the upwardly projecting web into the opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a molded plastic garment hanger in simplified form which in practice typically includes the usual strengthening ribs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> around the perimeter of the hook. The hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed with a flange <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defining a top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which in a preferred embodiment is flattened and slightly larger in peripheral dimensions than the lowermost portion of an indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) having side walls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed with at least one retention aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as described in Australian Patent No. 638436 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,354, the contents of which are incorporated into this specification by cross-reference. The apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> define through-openings which facilitate stacking of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with other indicators prior to fitting to a hanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The upstanding web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extends centrally from the top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and in this embodiment the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is shaped similarly to the shape of the cavity of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to comfortably fit within that cavity. Alternatively, the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be configured in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> herein or Australian Patent No. 638436. In a preferred embodiment the upstanding web is narrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed with integrally molded indicator attachment means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment the indicator attachment means includes central opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the upper portion of which a resilient detent leg <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> extends downwardly terminating in a laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> configured to engage one of the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the side wall of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Since the detent leg <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is narrow and is resiliently connected to web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is easily deflected laterally by means of a probe or pin inserted into the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which engages laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to displace laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> toward the plane of the web to clear the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and allow the indicator to be removed from the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. This operation can be achieved simply and quickly with little or no damage to the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or the attachment means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, while the laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> remains in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will remain securely fastened to the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and will withstand all usual handling operations to which the hanger is usually subjected in day-to-day use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> To improve the flexibility of the detent leg <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it can be reduced in thickness as shown at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the drawings, third, fourth and fifth embodiments of the invention are shown in which the same reference numerals are used to indicate similar parts. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>, the resilient detent leg extends angularly from its point of attachment to the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> of the drawings, and has a shorter laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed at its free end. The upstanding web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is further formed with a pair of ribs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on either side of the central semi-circular opening <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to prevent the indicator (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference>) from being inadvertently laterally displaced to clear the laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which engages the aperture of an indicator similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings. If desired, ribs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be provided in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the present invention in which flange <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is integrally formed as part of strengthening rib <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and extends around the perimeter of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the present invention the upstanding web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> formed on the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the hanger can be shaped and dimensioned similar to the shape of the cavity of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to comfortably fit within that cavity. By the same token, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, upstanding web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can also be formed in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shape of the shape of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so the hanger can be used with or without the indicator. The web can also be configured in the manner shown in Australian Patent No. 638436 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,354 or in any other manner to accommodate the cavity dimensions of any other type of indicator, including indicators that have angled or sloping end walls to conform to the angularity of the hook design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The indicator attachment mechanism described in the above embodiments provides a particularly simple and convenient means of retaining the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while enabling the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be conveniently removed in a simple operation which does not significantly damage either the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or the hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the hanger. In this way, the disadvantages associated with the attachment mechanism described in our Australian Patent No. 638436 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,354 are overcome in a simple but innovative manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the improved hanger hook of the present invention is formed of styrene which provides a clear virtually transparent hanger for maximum display of garments suspended therefrom. Alternately, the hanger could be formed from K resin, H.I. styrene, polypropylene or other suitable thermoplastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the drawings, a perspective view of an automated system for removing indicators from hangers is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of one embodiment of the decapping apparatus according to the present invention. A garment hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be decapped is provided with an upstanding web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which extends from a top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the hook of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The web is formed with integrally molded indicator attachment means. The attachment means includes a central opening defined in the upper portion of the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a detent leg, which extends downwardly terminating in a laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> configured to engage one of the apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the side walls of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment the laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is narrow and resiliently connected to the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> the top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is flat and has a width larger than the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As shown more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, side wall of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not aligned with the side walls of the hook of the flange. A top view of the indicator and hook of this embodiment is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> which more clearly shows top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> extending beyond side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a second preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the top region of the hook and the indicator have about the same width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The method and apparatus for removing the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hangers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be hereinafter described with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Throughout this description, the term decapping will be used to describe the removal of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is easily deflected laterally by means of a pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> inserted in the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which engages the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to displace it towards the plane of the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to clear the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and allow the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be removed from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. With the decapping apparatus of the present invention, indicators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be automatically removed from their respective hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fed to the decapping apparatus by means of a feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is inclined so that the hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> move downwardly toward the decapping apparatus by gravity. The hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be put onto the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> manually or automatically. Other means to feed hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the decapping apparatus could comprise a screw conveyor, a belt conveyor, or any other appropriate means to carry the hangers toward the decapping apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The decapping apparatus includes a front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and an actuating means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The actuating means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> comprises an escapement valve, which is pneumatically driven and includes two rods. Each of the rods is connected to the plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via respective connecting means <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are arranged vertically and are facing each other. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the two plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are almost quadratic, but any other appropriate shape, for example rectangular, can be used. The actuating means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> moves the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> parallel to each other in a vertical plane. This movement is periodically repeated, so that one hanger after another can be decapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> extends under the two plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The distance between the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> when said plates are in their lower positions and the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is preferably such that pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in its lower position will be aligned with aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The height of the assembly is adjusted to provide automatic operation for different styles of hanger hooks. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is in its lower position, and the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in its upper position. When the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves down the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> toward the decapping apparatus, the movement of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stopped by the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in operation, a plurality of hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are waiting in front of the decapping apparatus on the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in line, to be decapped one after the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, at the start of the decapping cycle, the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is lowered to its lowermost position. Plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has a recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> positioned on an outer portion of the surface facing the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to correspond to the dimensions of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that when a hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pressed against the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is received in the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is provided on the back wall of the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> in a position corresponding to the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The dimensions, such as the size and the shape of the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are selected according to the dimensions, particularly the shape and the depth, of the aperture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> enters the aperture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is able to displace the laterally projecting portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the web <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to clear the aperture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and allow the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be removed from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described above. In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the pin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a rectangular cross-section, but any other appropriate shape can be used, as will be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> At the start of the decapping cycle, the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is raised but only needs to be raised upwardly until it no longer covers the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. In other words, the amplitude of the movement of the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has to be at least the height of the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, so that the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be received in the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> After the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is received-in the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is moved downwardly to seat the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> firmly or at least to hold the indicator firmly in the recess <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In this position the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> displaces the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to permit the release of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is long enough to fully displace the laterally extending position <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, but is not long enough to engage the aperture <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of hook <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the lower edge <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be beveled, so that the downward movement of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> separates hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the rest of the hangers so that front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> enters between the hangers. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the lower edge is beveled towards the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> when the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has displaced the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the indicator may be removed from hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly to its upper position, while the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> stays in its lower position. Since pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> extends into the aperture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> carries the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> upwardly. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> engages hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and prevents the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from also being carried upwardly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates this situation, wherein both of the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are in their lower positions and the beveled lower edge <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> holds the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> down by abutting against the edge of the top region <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the hook of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has two functions: displacing the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to release the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and carrying the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> upwardly to separate the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the decapper mechanism with a second embodiment of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The lower edge <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> has a step-shape to hold the edge of the top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> down. As depicted in this embodiment and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably flat. For clarity of illustration, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> show only the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in their lower positions, a few hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has an aperture or a window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> having generally the same shape as the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. When the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is in its upper position and the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in its lower position, the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> match, so that the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be removed from the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> through the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can have any appropriate shape, as long as the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can pass through it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the described embodiment, the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is removed from the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> by means of an air blast. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the back wall of the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> has an aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, which is connected to an air control means by means of a tube <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The air blast through the opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is controlled, so that, when the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> reaches its upper position, and the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in its lower position, an air blast is generated or enabled, which pushes the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The released indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> passes through the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and is collected by a discharge tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which is positioned in front of the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and leads the released indicator to a container <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the position control means <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> comprises a first detector <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the position of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a second detector <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for the position of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The first detector <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the second detector <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> work on a pneumatical basis and have a similar structure. First and second detectors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> each include generally a cylindrical tube illustrated by <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, respectively, and pistons <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are movable within each of said cylindrical tubes <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The outer ends of pistons <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are provided with contact plates, which are contacted by the upper sides of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>

Also, the discharge tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a collecting container <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for the released indicators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates a side view of the air control means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the tube plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The air control means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> comprises a third detector <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> for detecting the position of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Third detector <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical tube <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> and a piston <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which, generally have the same shape and function as the first and second position detectors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> as described above. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is in its upper position, and the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in its lower position. The back plate having released and carried a indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> upwardly from hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, contacts a contact plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the position detector <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and moves the contact plate <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> together with its piston into the cylindrical tube of the detector <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. This causes a pneumatic signal within the air control means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which enables a pressurized air blast through a tube <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by appropriate connection <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The air blast through the opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> ejects the released indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into the discharge tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> indicates the direction of the movement of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In operation, the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> moves downwardly to its lower position, which is followed by an upward movement of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to its upper position. The whole movement cycle is repeated periodically, so that a plurality of hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be decapped easily and reliably in an automated process. Since one of the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is always in its respective lower position, there will be always a number of hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> waiting to be decapped one after another, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The actuating means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> controls the movement of the two plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, so that the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> cannot move upwardly when the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is not in its lower position, and the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> cannot move upwardly when the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not in its lower position. This ensures that the hangers to be decapped do not slide along the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> under the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> without being decapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The first timer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> controls the regular cycle of the movement of the two plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, whereas the second timer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> enables a repeated downward movement of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If, for example the hook of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is bent or damaged, or the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is bent or damaged, the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not permitted to slide downwardly to press or hold the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, since its lower edge contacts the upper edge of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is therefore restricted in its downward movement. In this case, the timer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> gives a signal to the actuating means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to lift the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> up again and retry to move it downwardly. This is repeated, until the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is properly received in the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can move to its lower position without resistance. This problem can already partially be avoided by an appropriate angle or bend of the lower edge of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a cross-section of the two plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in their lower positions and several hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be decapped on feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. These hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have a top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on their hooks, which does not extend beyond the width of the indicators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other words, the sidewalls of the indicators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are substantially even with the sidewalls of the hooks and the hangers. Therefore, the hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot be held down by the lower edge of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> abutting the edge of the top region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as described and shown with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. Since the hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot be held down by the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, when the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> moves-upwardly, this embodiment of the invention further includes a holding means <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which is activated to hold down the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being decapped, while the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is moving up. The holding means <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is pivotable around an axis <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment the holding means includes two parallel L-shaped arms <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, which are connected by a cross bar <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the holding position, the two arms <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of the holding means <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> extend parallel to both sides of the feeding rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the hook of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the arms <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> extend perpendicularly to the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot move upwardly, since its upper edge abuts the lower surface of the arms <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. After the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is removed from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the holding means is pivoted back to a free position (dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), so that the decapped hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can move down the rail <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In a different embodiment (not shown) the holding means could include a similarly shaped holding means being swung horizontally to hold the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> down. </paragraph>

The recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed in the lower portion of a wall member <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> extending from the middle portion of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be dimensioned to accommodate the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which, as depicted, has a basically rectangular shape. The recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is provided with the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are slightly larger than the dimensions of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be decapped, so that the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be oriented properly upon entering into the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. This is important to ensure that the aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> receives the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be replaced by any other appropriate means, for example a frame or a single sidewall, as long as the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can enter into the opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to release the indicator attachment mechanism to remove the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, when the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pressed or held against the back plate. The shape of the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is basically rectangular, but can be any other appropriate shape as necessary to match opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has two rail or slide members <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> bolted thereto, which are positioned to each side of the wall member <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> defining a space between the wall member and the rail members <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> respectively. The rail members <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> each have a generally rectangular shape with concave surfaces and extend the complete height of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Referring now in detail to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a tool for manually removing indicators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from hangers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a top view of one embodiment of the manual decapper, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows a sectional view taken along line <highlight><bold>2323</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the device for manually removing an indicator from a garment hanger has a plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which can have a rectangular shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>. The plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be made of metal or molded plastic and comprises at least one recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> correspond to the above-described recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the automatic decapping apparatus. The recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> perform exactly the same functions as described in relation to recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The only difference is that with the manual decapper, the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has to be pressed manually onto the recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, so that the pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is inserted in the opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to displace the laterally extending portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the hanger and to effect release of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or at least the body with hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has to be manually held or pressed onto the recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, to manually separate the plate <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> with the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment the plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can define through-holes <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> for mounting the device to a support (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> All the variations and features explained in view of the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the back plate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of the decapping apparatus are also true for the recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the manual decapper. The pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can also be configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, the plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape for ease of handling by the operator with the recess <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> being provided at a long side of the plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. However, in the alternative, the recess can be provided at a short side of the plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Or the decapper device <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can have further recesses, so that depending on the size and the shape of the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be removed multiple applications with the manual decapper of the present invention can be performed. For ease of operation the operator may chose to mount the device <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to a support (not shown) via through-holes <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> so that it is not necessary for the operator to handle the manual device <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> but only the hangers and the removed indicators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, a further recess <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is provided on one of the short sides of the rectangular plate <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is provided with a pin <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> positioned on the edge of the short side <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and has no side walls. This allows the recess <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to be applied to indicator caps <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of any configuration. In addition, the short side <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> can be curved thereby adapting to the form of the hook of the hanger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, from which the indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be removed. It should be understood, that for the recess <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the pin <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> the above-described features and variations explained in view of the recesses <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and. the pins <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are also true and applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Also, it should be understood that although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, various modifications by one skilled in the art can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the enclosed claims. Particularly, the decapping apparatus of the described embodiment is pneumatically driven. However, the decapping apparatus, namely the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> could also be driven by means of electrical, mechanical or any other appropriate drive mechanism. Also, the position control means <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the air pressure control means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can work using optical, electrical or any other appropriate detection means which detects the position of the plates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, respectively. The released indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be ejected from the recess <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> through the window <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by means other than a pressurized air blast, as described above. For example, the decapped indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could be ejected through the window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by means of an ejection pin or vacuum ejector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention has been described and illustrated in conjunction with a single type of indicator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The present invention can also be used without any adaptation or easily adapted to accommodate other types of indicators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> While there have been shown and described what are considered to be the several preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail can readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention not be limited to the exact form and detail herein shown and described nor to anything less than the whole of the invention herein disclosed as hereinafter claimed. </paragraph>
