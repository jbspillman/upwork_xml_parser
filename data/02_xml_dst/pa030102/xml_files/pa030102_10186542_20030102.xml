<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An escalator or moving walkway includes a support structure supported between the rests at a cable, which is arranged laterally or below the support structure. According to the invention there is provided in the region of each rest a respective lever which is rotatably mounted at the support structure and is slidingly supported by one arm at the building structure, the cable being fastened to the other arm of the lever so that the cable is additionally tensioned when the support structure bends. In this manner, the construction is very stiff so that the escalator bends only slightly even under heaving loading. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an escalator or moving walkway with at least one support structure supported between a cable, which is arranged as an auxiliary support structure laterally or below the support structure. Such a cable may also be termed &ldquo;under-bracing&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such an escalator or such a moving walkway is known from EP 866019 A1. By virtue of the cable under-bracing a support structure can be constructed to bridge over longer spans, or a given support structure can be dimensioned less strongly for a given span, so that the escalator or moving walkway appears more slender. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage to such a known construction is that, when the support structure bends as a result of loading, the cable stretches as it supports a greater proportion of the load, and thus cannot sufficiently counteract the bending deflections. However, only small bending deflections are normally permissible. Because otherwise disturbances arise in the mechanical system of the escalator or moving walkway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to develop an escalator or a moving walkway of the kind stated in the introduction in such a manner that the supporting effect of the overall construction is increased, i.e. bends less under load. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention this object is met by an escalator or a moving walkway of the kind stated in the introduction in which the region of each rest there is provided a respective lever which is rotatably mounted at the support structure and which is slidingly supported by one arm at the building structure, the cable being fastened to another arm of the lever so that the cable is additionally tensioned with increasing loading (useful load) and thereby increases the supporting effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since the cable is tensioned more strongly when the support structure is loaded, the tension in the cable is increased so that the main support structure is raised relatively at the cable support points.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A moving walkway as depicted in the Figures connects a first story with a second story. It bears by way of rests (not illustrated) on the respective story floor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The moving walkway is bounded laterally by balustrades <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for example of glass, which carry handrails <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at their tops. Disposed at both sides of the moving walkway is, as usual, a support structure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is constructed as a framework with an upper boom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a lower boom <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A respective lever <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted at each of the ends of the support structure at the point <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and, in particular, at the lower boom <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or in the vicinity thereof. This lever <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported by way of a slide bearing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which can be constructed as a damping plate, at the respective story floor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A respective end of a cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fastened to the other end of each lever <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the support structure at the support points <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> serves as an under-bracing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention functions as follows: if the moving walkway is strongly loaded, the support structure begins to bend. This bending is counteracted by the cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on which the support structure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is supported at support points <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The cable is thereby additionally loaded, so that it stretches somewhat. Due to the bending deflection of the support structure <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the lower boom <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> stretches and the upper boom <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shortens. The points <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which lie at the lower boom, therefore creep somewhat apart, i.e. in each case in a direction towards the adjacent story floor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The lower ends of the levers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thereby slide in the slide bearings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> somewhat downwardly and the two levers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rotate so that the upper ends thereof move more strongly in the direction towards the respective storey floor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> than the points <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is thereby tensioned, whereby an additional support force &Dgr;Fu acts at the support points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In total, four levers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of that kind may be present, namely two at each of the sides of the moving walkway; at the upper end and the lower end. The construction can be laterally stabilized by diagonal struts <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
