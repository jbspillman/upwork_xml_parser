<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a level shift circuit for high frequency level shift operation and, more specifically, to a circuit which provides immunity against common mode variations for high frequency level shift operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Level shift circuits for shifting the potential of a small control signal to a higher or a lower voltage level are well known, and are frequently implemented into power integrated circuit chips. A typical power integrated circuit chip is the IR2151 sold by the International Rectifier Corporation, the assignee of the present invention. The IR2151 is a high voltage, high speed MOS gated IC with independent high side and low side outputs for driving the gates of high side and low side power transistors (typically power MOSFETs or insulated gate bipolar transistors (&ldquo;IGBTs&rdquo;)) arranged in a half-bridge configuration. The level shift circuit is used in such power integrated circuits for raising the voltage level of the control signal for the high side power transistor to a level near the level of the high voltage rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Level shift circuits such as the one used in the IR2151 power IC are typically pulse-based circuits in which the input control signal is converted into pulses at the rising and falling edges of the control signal to provide &ldquo;set&rdquo; and &ldquo;reset&rdquo; for a latch which in turn controls the gate of the high side power transistor. By level shifting these pulses, instead of the control signal, the level shift circuit is turned on only briefly, thereby dissipating much less power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,981, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference, discloses a &ldquo;reset dominant&rdquo; scheme for a pulse-based level shift circuit which prevents false operation, i.e., the production of an output which is not called for by the logic input, as a result of a noise &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; or false pulse. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the present application shows the pulse-based level shift circuit of U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,981, in which rising and falling edges of an input signal cause a pulse generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to produce set and reset pulses which are fed to respective high voltage level transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which, after passing through pulse filter block <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, respectively set and reset an RS latch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of RS latch <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which constitutes the high voltage equivalent of the low voltage control signal, and is used to control the switching of output transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which in turn produce a signal at an intermediate pin HO which is used to gate the high side power transistor connected to the IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One problem associated with pulse-based level shift circuits such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is that the pulses are of a constant width and amplitude, which affects both propagation delay from input to output and also power dissipation, potentially limiting frequency of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To overcome the above-noted limitation, an alternative level shift circuit has been proposed, which is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/984,084, filed Oct. 26, 2001 (IR-1934), which does not operate on pulses generated from the input signal, and is thus not constrained by pulse characteristics. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this non-pulse level shift circuit includes switching circuitry (namely, transistors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and inverter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), which responds to transitions between high and low values in the input signal, turning a first current path on in response to a low-to-high transition in the input signal V<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>, and turning a second current path on in response to a high-to-low transition in the input signal. This is accomplished by driving the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with two anti-phase signals: transistor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives IN, which is the input signal from source VN without inversion; transistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives IN*, which is an inverted version of input signal VN produced by inverter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The shifting circuitry of the non-pulse level shift circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is formed of enhancement-mode transistors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and provides output signals OUT and OUT* at nodes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The shifting circuitry responds to the current flowing in the first and second paths, thereby shifting the level of the output signals (OUT or OUT*) according to a transition in the input signal and turning off the path that was turned on by the switching circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The parasitic capacitance associated with transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the prior art level shift circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and with transistors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the non-pulse based level shift circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, are primarily associated with the dv/dt problem. When a dv/dt occurs on the Vs node, false operation of the IC can occur unless sufficient current is supplied to charge these parasitic capacitances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By implementing the circuit of the present invention, the need for a pulse filter block <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is reduced or eliminated, which in turn reduces the propagation delay of the IC. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The circuit of the present invention advantageously overcomes the above noted deficiencies of the prior art by sensing the amount of current that must be supplied to the parasitic capacitors associated with the level shift transistors during a dv/dt condition, and injecting this current in a timely manner to prevent false operation of the IC. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> circuit diagram of the present invention is shown. Assume that the level shift circuit has finished translating the input signal and it is in a stable state. In the circuit of the present invention, the transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a dummy transistor which is always OFF. Depending on whichever level shift circuit it is connected to, transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exactly similar in its construction to the transistors of block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the prior art, (or) to the transistors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The purpose of transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is to imitate the real parasitic capacitance associated with these transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Assume that there is a rising dv/dt on the node &ldquo;VS&rdquo;. The voltage on node &ldquo;Vs&rdquo; will increase rapidly, which means &ldquo;VB&rdquo; which is a DC (VBS) voltage above &ldquo;Vs&rdquo; will also increase. An increase in &ldquo;VB&rdquo; will cause a sense current to flow through transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the magnitude of this current is sensed from the parasitic capacitance of transistor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The current flowing through transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is mirrored through transistor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and is available at the node &ldquo;Boost&rdquo;. The duration of this sense current depends on the duration of the dv/dt pulse and also on the RC delay provided by resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and transistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The current at node &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; is injected into the drain node of transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This will prevent the false trigger of the output state due to a dv/dt condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the current at the &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; node of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is injected into either node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> depending on whether transistor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is OFF. If transistor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was OFF, which implies node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is high, the current from &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; node is injected into node <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to ensure that this node stays high even during the dv/dt condition. If this node goes low, it could result in a output false state with respect to input VIN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention thus uses the transient noise or dv/dt signals to provide a &ldquo;boost&rdquo; current to the level shift circuit to prevent false operation thereof when the noise or dv/dt conditions occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited by the specific disclosure herein. </paragraph>
