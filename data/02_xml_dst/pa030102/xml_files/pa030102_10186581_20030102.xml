<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present patent application is based upon Provisional Patent application Serial No. 60/302,293 filed Jul. 2, 2001 and entitled &ldquo;HAIR STYLE PILLOW&rdquo;.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a neck support for a person while reclining, and more particularly, to a curved pillow that supports the neck without interfering with the particular hairstyle of the person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are, of course, a considerable number of differing pillows that are used to support or cushion the person&apos;s head while reclining, such as while sleeping. A typical problem with many pillows, however, is that the pillow is adapted to be located underneath the head of the person and extends above the person&apos;s ears where it interferes with the hair style of the person, that is, the pillow directly contacts the hair of the person and thereby can have a messing up effect on the hair style. Accordingly, upon arising in the morning, the particular hair style has generally been messed up and has to be re-touched or restyled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the cost of hairstyling today, the continual and constant messing up of a hair style at night or whenever sleeping is not only a nuisance to redo the hair but, in addition, it can be expensive to have to restyle the hair. As a further difficulty, in the event the person has specially styled the hair for a special event, it is a bother to have to redo the hair the next day or even for that special occasion if the hair was styled a day in advance. As an example, there are may special occasions that takes place on a Sunday so the hair must be styled prior to that day and it is therefore a considerable bother to have the hair style messed up by sleeping on the hair during the night and have to re touch up the hair style for that Sunday event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The problem with the normal, conventional pillow is that the consistency is generally soft, cushiony and the head sinks down into the pillow so that the pillow contacts and sometimes surrounds the hair of the person. As such, as the person normally moves the head during sleep, the normal movement of head during sleep causes the hair to rub against the pillow, or the mattress supporting the pillow, such that the hair becomes disheveled during the normal night&apos;s sleep and the person has the annoyance of redoing the hair the next day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are, however, certain devices that try to specifically protect the hairdo of a person and one such example is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,949,437 of Gritsch where there is a head rest device that allows the person&apos;s hair to be located beyond a head support that extends upwardly from a base board. A difficulty with such arrangement, however, is that there is a need for a base board, said to be constructed of plywood or the like, and which is not particularly comfortable and is also somewhat difficult to transport or to use on a bed. Additionally, the head rest of the Gritsch patent is not readily suitable to be used with standard pillow cover and no such pillow cover is apparently contemplated by that patent. The device is described to be more like a head rest than a pillow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,295, there is disclosed an apparatus for restoring spinal cervical curvature by a head support, however, the support is comprised of a substantially non-deformable material and therefore would appear to be uncomfortable for a person to lie on the apparatus for any length of time. As indicated in that patent, it is designed for short term treatment, such as for several minutes at a time and would not be suitable for a person to sleep on for a night. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a pillow for supporting person&apos;s head that is specially designed to support the person&apos;s neck but without contacting the hair of the person so as to avoid messing up the hair style during sleep. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an improved pillow that overcomes the aforedescribed deficiencies of the present, conventional pillows and head rests. With the present invention, there is provided a pillow that is contoured so as to support the neck of the person while maintain the hair of the person basically elevated with respect to the sleeping surface on which the person is lying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With the present pillow, the person&apos;s neck is cradled within the concave shaped upper surface that extends from the shoulders of the person to just below the lower ear so that the hair of the person extends outwardly, cantilever fashion, from the pillow so as to avoid contact with the sleeping surface. Preferably, the lower surface of the pillow is a flat surface and rests on the sleeping surface while the lateral sides can be sloped inwardly in the upper direction toward the upper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the pillow is filled with a foam material, such as a polyester form so as to provide sufficient support to hold the person&apos;s head off of the sleeping surface. Also preferably, there is a removable cover made of cotton or polyester, and which can be a standard sized cover so as to be readily available at an economical cost and which can be a washable fabric. Alternatively the pillow cover can be of a silky fabric, such as satin, that can be slipped on and, in any case, the cover can have some securing means such as a button, snap or zipper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Other features of the present pillow will become apparent in light of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a front view of a pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention. As can be seen, the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a relatively flat bottom surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and which is adapted to sit atop of the sleeping surface on which the person lays for sleeping. Extending upwardly from the bottom surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are a pair of lateral side surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, both of which may preferably be angled inwardly as they approach the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As also can be seen, the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is concave downwardly so that the person can lay upon the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to rest comfortably thereupon. The pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be constructed of a foam material for the comfort of the user, but which has sufficient sturdiness to support the person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are fairly critical in the construction since the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must fit under the user and nestle between the shoulder and the lower ear of the user. Thus, the width of the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably about 12 to 15 inches and that width is identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as the dimension W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition, the height is also of importance in the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and that dimension is preferably about 4 to about 6 inches and is identified by the dimension H in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to fit between the shoulders and the lower ear of the user to support the neck and head of that user and, as will be seen, the head remains elevated above the sleeping surface on which the person is lying and thus, preserving the hair style of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a bottom view of the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and showing a zipper <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is used to hold a cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> onto the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. That cover can be a standard dimensioned cover so that the cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be readily available to the user and may be cotton or other normal material currently used for such covers. Alternatively, the cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be comprised of a silky material, such as satin, to make the pillow more comfortable to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As can also be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the depth of the pillow is identified by the dimension D and is, preferably, about 8 to about 10 inches. That dimension is important in the present pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to allow the pillow to comfortably fit under the user and be situated between the shoulder and the lower ear of the user and also so as to allow the hair style of the user to extend beyond the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a cantilever manner, to retain the head and the hair elevated with respect to the sleeping surface on which the person is positioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a side view showing the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention underlying a person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, therefore, the use of the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is exemplified and the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located under the person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> situated between the shoulder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the lower ear <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the person. Thus, the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends outwardly from the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is supported such that the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is elevated above the sleeping surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on which the person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is lying. As such, the hair <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the person <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> remains untouched and, therefore, not messed, by means of contact with the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the sleeping surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> since the hair does not touch the pillow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the sleeping surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the hair <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can retain whatever style has been used on the hair <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and that style will not be messed up overnight by the person sleeping on the sleeping surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that the hair will be appealing the next day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed herein, by way of example, but only by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
