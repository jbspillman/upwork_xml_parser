<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is composed of a rewritable optical disk (represented as ReWritable optical disk in the drawings) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a data area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for acquiring data from the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for controlling data acquisition, construction of a cache table and transfer of data to the host computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> possesses a function of acquiring an alternate list <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the alternate list temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a function of executing buffering for the data area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a function of executing caching for a data in the alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subdivided into an alternate list temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for buffering the alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a data temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for buffering data, and a cache <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for caching a data in the alternate area. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 1. Acquisition of the Alternate List (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> designates an address of the alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an acquisition destination pointer of the alternate list, and the acquisition size of the alternate list to the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> acquires, for the alternate list acquisition destination pointer of the alternate list temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, an alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the address of the designated alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the portion corresponding to the alternate list acquisition size (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 2. Buffering of the Data Area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> designates the address of the data area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the buffer pointer and the buffer size to the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>), and the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> executes buffering to the buffer pointer for the portion corresponding to the buffer size, from the address of the designated data area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the optical disk (S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 3. Caching of Data in the Alternate Area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> retrieves within the alternate list <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to check whether or not there exists a defective data in the buffering data (S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). If no defective data exists, caching of data in the alternative area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will not take place (S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) If there exists one, it is checked whether or not the alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> required for caching has already been cached (S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>), and only when it is not cached yet, the control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> designate the address, the caching size and the cache pointer of the alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), and the decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> caches, to the cache pointer, data of the alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for the portion corresponding to the cache size from the addresses of the alternate area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Moreover, with an address of a defective area and a buffer pointer where the data of the defective area is buffered are formed into one set, a cache table <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is constructed from a collection of such sets equal in number to the number of buffer pointers present in the area of the temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 4. Transfer of Buffered Data and Cached Data to the host computer (S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> checks whether or not the buffered data indicated by the buffer pointer is a defective data by referring to the caching table constructed in the process <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. in the above (S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). If it is not defective, data is transferred from the temporary storage memory area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the host computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), and if it is a defective data, an alternate data for the defective data is transferred to the host computer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the cache (S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) The above processing is repeated for number of times corresponding to the buffer size (S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As seen from the above processing, when a defective data is found in the data buffered from a rewritable optical disk, it is necessary to cache alternate area data to serve as the substitute. Prior art for caching an alternate area can be found in Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open, No. 2000-21090, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open, No. 2000-298949, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. Hei 6-325494, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open, No. Hei 8-180598, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open, No. Hei 1-245463, and the like. However, a cache is needed for implementing caching, which has been a problem in the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> That is, a rewritable optical disk has an alternate list and an alternate area in the unit of tracks, and access is made in the unit of tracks, so that according to the conventional method, caching algorithm fails to act effectively, and an additional caching time and a cache are needed for implementing caching. </paragraph>
