<heading lvl="1">Field of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention lies in the semiconductor technology and memory technology fields. More specifically, the invention relates to a circuit configuration and a method for determining a time constant of a storage capacitor of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor memories have memory cells each comprising, for example, a storage capacitor (or memory capacitor) and a selection transistor. The time duration for storing or for reading out an information item into the memory cell is determined, inter alia, by the time constant of the storage capacitor. The time constant thereby depends on the storage capacitance of the storage capacitor and the lead resistance of the storage capacitor. In this case, the storage capacitor may be regarded as a capacitor connected up to a resistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The time constant or the delay time during the signal transfer of a capacitor connected up to a resistor is referred to, by way of example, as RC time constant. Inter alia, RC time constants of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory, can be determined by means of the present invention. In order to determine for example the RC time constants of a memory cell which has a trench capacitor as storage capacitor of the memory cell, it is advantageous to configure the standard process for fabricating a DRAM as closely as possible to the fabrication process used in the product, so that the arrangement for determining the RC time constant, which arrangement is fabricated as a test structure, corresponds to a memory cell arranged in the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By way of example, if the RC time constant of a trench capacitor is to be determined, then the capacitance C is formed to the greatest possible extent by the capacitance of the trench capacitor. The resistance R comprises, inter alia, the resistance of the conductive trench filling of the trench capacitor and also the resistance of a buried contact formed in the trench and the resistance of a selection transistor which is connected to the trench capacitor and is switched into the on state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the delay time of a memory cell capacitor connected up to a resistor, it is known from the prior art, for example, that a trench capacitor which deviates greatly from the round form of a bored hole and assumes a slotted form in the substrate and thus has greatly modified geometrical forms compared with a trench capacitor used in the product in a memory cell can be used for determining a delay time. What is problematic here is that a structure which deviates very greatly from a storage capacitor used in the product is used for determining a delay time. Consequently, a product-relevant measurement of the RC time constant of the storage capacitor used in the product is not reliably possible with this structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a circuit configuration and method for determining a time constant of a storage capacitor of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory, which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and which is useful to determine the time constant of the storage capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a circuit configuration for determining a time constant of a storage capacitor of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> a ring oscillator, which has at least three series-connected inverters; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> an interconnect, which has a first segment and a second segment and which connects up two inverters of the ring oscillator to one another; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> a storage capacitor and a lead resistor, which has a first resistor terminal and a second resistor terminal, the first resistor terminal being connected to the storage capacitor and the second resistor terminal being connected to the interconnect between the first segment and the second segment; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> a measuring device, which is connected up to the ring oscillator and which can be used to determine a value for the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator, a device by which a value for the time constant of the storage capacitor can be determined on the basis of the value of the oscillation frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The storage capacitor is connected via the lead resistor to the interconnect which is arranged between two inverters of the ring oscillator. This increases the total capacitance of the interconnect, as a result of which the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator is reduced. The time constant of the storage capacitor and the lead resistor can be determined from the reduction of the oscillator frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the measuring device comprises a frequency divider. A frequency divider has the advantage that it divides a possibly very high oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator down to a significantly lower frequency which, in a downstream circuit, on account of the lower frequency, can be determined in a simplified manner with a significantly lower outlay on apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the circuit configuration further has </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> a second ring oscillator comprising at least three series-connected inverters to be arranged as reference resonant circuit, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> a mixer having a first mixer input, a second mixer input and a mixer output to be connected up to the ring oscillator and the second ring oscillator, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> the first ring oscillator being connected to the first mixer input and the second ring oscillator being connected to the second mixer input and the mixer output being connected to the measuring device for the purpose of determining a value for the difference between a first frequency of the first ring oscillator and a second frequency of the second ring oscillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The mixer makes it possible to generate a signal which characterizes the difference between the frequency of the first ring oscillator and the second ring oscillator. This enables the direct determination of a differential frequency. The second ring oscillator is used as reference resonant circuit, so that it does not comprise, for example, the storage capacitors to be measured, the latter only being coupled to the interconnect in the case of the first ring oscillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A further refinement of the circuit configuration according to the invention provides for a transistor to be connected up in such a way that the lead resistor and the storage capacitor can be coupled to and decoupled from the interconnect by means of the transistor. The transistor enables the targeted connection of the storage capacitor to be measured, including the lead resistor. The conductivity and thus the electrical resistance of the controllable path of the transistor can be controlled via a gate terminal. If the controllable path is set such that it has a high resistance, then the storage capacitor is practically decoupled from the interconnect. By contrast, if the controllable path is set at very low impedance, then the storage capacitor is coupled to the interconnect and has an attenuating effect on the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, a multiplicity of storage capacitors of memory cells of a memory cell array of a semiconductor memory are connected up to the interconnect. This is advantageous since the storage capacitance of a storage capacitor of a semiconductor memory is usually made very small, so that the parallel coupling of a multiplicity of storage capacitors to the interconnect effects a frequency alteration of the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator which is greater by a multiple. The frequency change of the ring oscillation which is enlarged by a multiple can be measured with lower measurement outlay, with reduced susceptibility to interference and increased precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A further advantageous refinement of the circuit configuration according to the invention provides for the circuit configuration to be arranged on a substrate, on which a word line for controlling the transistor and the interconnect are arranged, the word line running parallel to the interconnect at least in sections. By virtue of this routing of the interconnect to which the multiplicity of capacitors connected up to resistors is in each case connected, the time-delaying effect of the multiplicity of storage capacitors is combined with one another for influencing the oscillation frequency of a ring oscillator. By virtue of the special routing of the interconnect, a meandering structure is arranged on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With the above and other objects in view there is also provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for determining a time constant of a storage capacitor of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory. The method has the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> providing a circuit configuration which comprises a ring oscillator having at least three series-connected inverters, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> which comprises an interconnect having a first segment and a second segment, the interconnect connecting up two inverters of the ring oscillator to one another, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> which comprises a storage capacitor and a lead resistor, the lead resistor connecting the storage capacitor to the interconnect between the first segment and the second segment, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> which comprises a measuring device, which is connected up to the ring oscillator; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> determining a value for the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator by means of the measuring device, a value for the time constant of the storage capacitor being determined from the value for the oscillation frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention makes it possible to determine the time constant of the storage capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A further, advantageous method step provides for </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> the lead resistor and the storage capacitor to be connected up to the interconnect by means of a transistor and to be able to be coupled to and decoupled from the interconnect by means of the transistor, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> a first value for a first oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator being determined for the operation of the ring oscillator decoupled from the interconnect by means of the transistor, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> a second value for a second oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator being determined for the operation of the ring oscillator coupled to the interconnect by means of the transistor, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> the time constant of the storage capacitor to be determined on the basis of the first value and the second value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A further refinement of the method according to the invention provides for </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> a second ring oscillator, which comprises at least three series-connected inverters to be provided as reference resonant circuit, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> a mixer having a first mixer input and a second mixer input and a mixer output to be provided, the first ring oscillator being connected up to the first mixer input and the second ring oscillator being connected up to the second mixer input, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> the mixer to form a value for the difference between the first oscillation frequency of the first ring oscillation and the second oscillation frequency of the second ring oscillator and to communicate it to the measuring device, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> the time constant of the storage capacitor to be determined on the basis of the value for the difference between the frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a circuit configuration and a method for determining a time constant of a storage capacitor of a memory cell of a semiconductor memory, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a first inverter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a first input <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a first output <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The illustration furthermore shows a second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a second input <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a second output <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A third inverter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has a third input <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a third output <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The first output <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the second input <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through an interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or conductor track <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the second output <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the third input <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the third output <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is connected to the first input <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This ring configuration thus forms a ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A ring oscillator usually comprises an odd number of inverters which are connected in series, the output of the last inverter being connected up to the input of the first inverter. By virtue of the odd number of inverters, for the ring oscillator circuit there is only an indifferently stable and no stable state, which reverts to a stable quiescent position upon deflection, so that the circuit oscillates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a first segment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a second segment <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The first segment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is wherein for example by a first electrical resistance <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The second segment <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is wherein by a second electrical resistance <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. A capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by way of a lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. In this case, the lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> has a first resistor terminal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a second resistor terminal <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. The first resistor terminal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is connected to the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the second resistor terminal <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between the first segment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the second segment <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A measuring device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the third output <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The measuring device comprises, for example, a frequency divider <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> which is suitable for dividing down the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator, so that the frequency can be determined with a lower outlay. Furthermore, the measuring device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises functions for determining the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is additionally arranged, which has a first transistor terminal <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, a second transistor terminal <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and a gate terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> additionally has a controllable path <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, between the first transistor terminal <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the second transistor terminal <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, that can be controlled via the gate terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The first transistor terminal <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is connected to the second resistor terminal <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and the second transistor terminal <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a location between the first segment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the second segment <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. As a result of this, the object to be measured, comprising the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, is connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by way of the transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The transistor can be put into high-impedance state and a low-impedance state by a suitable gate voltage, which is applied to the gate terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In addition, by way of example, between the second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the third inverter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a capacitor with a lead resistor is connected via a conductive connection <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to the conductive connection between the second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the third inverter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, this connection can also be formed as a controllable transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A method for determining the signal delay time of the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> connected up to the resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> provides for the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator to be determined by way of the measuring device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The signal delay time of the resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can subsequently be determined from the oscillation frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> One method variant provides for the lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be decoupled from the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by means of the transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, by the transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> being put into a high-impedance switching state. A reference frequency of the ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is determined in this switching state. Afterward, the transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is put into a low-impedance state, so that the resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are coupled to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Then, by means of a further frequency measurement, the oscillation frequency is determined for determining the signal delay time of the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the signal delay time additionally caused by the resistor and the capacitor can be determined from the difference between the reference frequency and the oscillation frequency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is illustrated the ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and, in addition, a ring oscillator <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The latter includes a fourth inverter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with a fourth input <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and a fourth output <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and also a fifth inverter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> with a fifth input <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a fifth output <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and a sixth inverter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with a sixth input <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and a sixth output <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>.

As a result of this, the second ring oscillator <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is formed as reference ring oscillator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The first mixer input <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is connected to the first ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and the second mixer input <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is connected to the second ring oscillator <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The mixer output <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is connected to the measuring device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which comprises, for example, a frequency divider <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and a circuit configuration <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for determining a frequency which makes it possible to determine the signal delay time of the resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A method for determining a signal delay time of the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> provides for the oscillator frequency of the reference ring oscillator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, to which the resistance <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to be measured and the capacitance <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be measured are connected, to be fed to the mixer, which compares these with one another and generates a differential frequency from which the signal delay time of the resistor and of the capacitor can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the circuit configuration <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is connected between the first inverter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The circuit configuration <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> will be explained in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The further interconnect <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> will be described in more detail in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> arranged between the first inverter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is arranged on a substrate surface <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> of a substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The substrate surface <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> defines a first direction X and a second direction Y. The X and Y directions are mutually orthogonal. The interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> runs over an active region <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, to which a trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is connected. Contrary to a customary layer for a DRAM memory cell array, in this exemplary embodiment the word line <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is not arranged between the bit line contact <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, but rather runs above the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and is insulated from the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> by a suitable insulation layer. Consequently, during a subsequent implantation, a continuously doped region which connects the trench capacitor directly to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed, rather than a transistor, between the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and the bit line contact <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. With respect to the first direction X, adjacent trench capacitors at adjacent active regions are connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a connecting element running in the direction of the second direction Y. Parallel to the first direction X, in a direction opposite to the first direction X, the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> runs anew over active regions and thus contact-connects further trench capacitors <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, via which the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> is connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is formed for example by a conductive trench filling&mdash;arranged in the trench capacitor&mdash;and the continuously doped region in the active region <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment provides for stacked capacitors rather than trench capacitors to be arranged at the position <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the circuit configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is connected between the second inverter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> an the third inverter <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the doped region between the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and the bit line contact <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> forming the conductive connection <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the plan view of a memory cell array. An active region <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> is connected to a trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The active region <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> is additionally connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a bit line contact <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In contrast to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the word line <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is arranged between the bit line contact <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The word line <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is suitable for driving the gate terminal <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the transistor <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the trench capacitor <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> can be electrically coupled to and decoupled from the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by means of the word line <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> likewise runs in a meandering fashion on the surface <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, wherein case, with respect to the first direction X, adjacent active regions <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> are connected to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a connecting element <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> along the second direction Y, which element connects to one another a further segment of the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which runs antiparallel to the first direction X and likewise contact-connects adjacent active regions <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The circuit configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is illustrated for example as the further circuit configuration <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a further configuration of a memory cell array. In contrast to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, however, no capacitors are formed, so that the interconnect <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be arranged for example as interconnect between the fourth inverter <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the fifth inverter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in order to influence the oscillation frequency of the reference ring oscillator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> If the lead resistor has a small resistance, then the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is coupled very well to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, so that it leads to a long signal propagation time and great attenuation which effects a large frequency alteration in the ring oscillator. If the lead resistor has the resistance <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, for example, then the resistance of the first segment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> forms, together with the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a traditional low-pass filter. If the lead resistor has a resistance that differs from 0, then the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, with rising resistance of the lead resistor, is coupled to the interconnect <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to an ever lesser extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For a fast DRAM chip, wherein the charge stored in a storage capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is to be transported as rapidly as possible to a sense amplifier, a large value for the lead resistor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> has a braking effect on the charge transport from the capacitor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to a sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present application describes test structures which contain a ring oscillator in order to generate on a memory chip an oscillating signal which can oscillate for example at a frequency of 200 MHz. The ring oscillator comprises a series of cascaded CMOS inverters. The inverters and the measuring device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be arranged, for example, in the so-called kerf of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In order to enable an oscillation, an odd number of CMOS inverters are required in a ring oscillator circuit. An RC delay element to be measured can be integrated as connecting element between the individual inverters. The alteration of the signal propagation time caused by the RC delay element influences the frequency of the ring oscillator. The oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator is usually reduced by the connection of a capacitance to the connecting line between two inverters. At frequencies in the range of a few megahertz the oscillation signal can be measured directly by measurement tips at a characterization measurement station. For higher frequencies, a frequency divider may optionally be provided which reduces the frequencies that occur to a measurable level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An increase in the measurement accuracy can furthermore be achieved by the arrangement of two ring oscillators, the RC element to be measured being integrated in the case of the first ring oscillator and the second ring oscillator not having the RC element to be measured and thus being usable as reference ring oscillator. The two oscillation signals can be combined with the aid of a mixer so that the mixer outputs, at its output, the difference between the two oscillations as differential frequency. Consequently, an output signal can be measured in the case of very small frequency differences between the ring oscillator and the reference ring oscillator. It can thus be expected that frequency differences between the ring oscillator and the reference ring oscillator in the thousandths range can be detected. For the example of a trench capacitor as RC element, the series resistance of the capacitor electrode can also be measured from these measurements, provided that the capacitance is determined by an independent measurement. This is possible for example by means of a static capacitance measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the coupling of the trench capacitors by means of a doping region or by means of a transistor, the parasitic quantities of the lead resistances and capacitances&mdash;such as metal tracks and contact hole fillings&mdash;can be eliminated in the measurement. To that end, the signal propagation path to be measured is firstly embodied with selection transistors and trench capacitors which are not arranged in the reference ring oscillator. By virtue of the parallel driving of the selection transistors, the capacitors are either connected or not connected for the delay paths. A conductive connection exists, for example, in the case of the reference ring oscillator. The influence of all the parasitic quantities on the measurement result can thus be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This enables the time constant of an RC element to be measured directly. For this purpose, a ring oscillator, in particular, is used to generate an oscillation signal on the chip which can be converted into easily measurable quantities by the use of frequency dividers. In addition, the measurement accuracy can be considerably increased by the use of a reference ring oscillator and by mixing the measurement signal with the reference signal. In this case, the structures shown can be produced by means of a standard CMOS process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> One variant of the invention provides that the elements to be measured can be connected to the conductive connection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of a ring oscillator by means of a transistor. In this case, it is possible to integrate a large number of RC elements which effect a correspondingly large delay signal for the ring oscillator. </paragraph>
