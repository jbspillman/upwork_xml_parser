<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a two-terminal circuit that is incorporated in a semiconductor integrated circuit device with a multilayer structure, a semiconductor integrated circuit that includes the two-terminal circuit, a method for changing design information that represents the two-terminal circuit, and a design aiding device that provides an aid in changing design information that represents the two-terminal circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In response to recent demands for smaller, faster, and more power-saving semiconductor IC (integrated circuit) devices, semiconductor IC devices with a multilayer structure have been commercialized. A semiconductor IC device with a multilayer structure is constructed by laminating, on a semiconductor substrate, a plurality of layers of circuit elements including insulators, metal wiring lines, wells, contacts, poly silicon, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor IC device with a multilayer structure exhibits improved packaging density because a three-dimensional circuit is formed on a semiconductor substrate in the semiconductor IC device. The improved packaging density, together with the finer-line processes, contributes to achieving smaller, faster, and more power-saving features of the semiconductor IC device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To form the layers of the circuit elements on the semiconductor substrate, a plurality of masks showing layout patterns corresponding to the layers are used. The layers of the circuit elements are formed one after another, by repeatedly processing the semiconductor substrate using a mask showing the corresponding layout pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Some conventional semiconductor IC devices with a multilayer structure have switches for various purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A conventional switch referred to herein intends to mean a part of a predetermined layer that is formed as being in the electrically connected state or in the electrically disconnected state. In accordance with a layout pattern corresponding to the predetermined layer, the part being in the electrically-connected state is formed by filling the part with a conductive material such as a metal wiring line and poly silicon, or the part being in the electrically-disconnected state is formed by leaving the part as an insulating part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The state of such switches is set different for each prototype version of semiconductor IC devices or for each manufacturing lot of semiconductor IC devices. The following describes use examples of such switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (1) Semiconductor IC devices are each provided with a switch, and a circuit that delays a signal for which a timing adjustment is expected, by a time period in accordance with the state of the switch. When a semiconductor IC device of a certain prototype version is found to have a defective relating to a timing of such a signal, the state of a switch in a semiconductor IC device of a new version is changed to adjust the timing of the signal. By doing so, the defective can be eliminated in the semiconductor IC device of the new version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (2) The state of switches is set different for each design version of semiconductor IC devices. By doing so, each semiconductor IC device is given an ID number for identifying its design version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (3) An original layout pattern is designed so as to execute all or some of the functions in accordance with the state of switches included therein. By changing the state of the switches of the original layout pattern, a number of layout patterns that are based on the original layout pattern and that each differ in a range of executing the functions can be generated. By doing so, a variety of semiconductor IC devices with different additional features can be manufactured efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As described above, such conventional switches set different for each prototype version, each manufacturing lot, and the like, are integrated into semiconductor IC devices to achieve various purposes such as defective correction, version identification, and more efficient manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Here, the following describes a conventional way to manufacture the above semiconductor IC device of the new version in which the state of the switch has been changed. First, a new layout pattern for the layer including the switch is drafted by a designer. A new mask is prepared according to the drafted layout pattern for the layer. A semiconductor substrate is then newly processed using the newly prepared mask for the layer including the switch and the previously used masks for the other layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The problem here is that the time and cost required for preparing masks are substantial because a method for optically correcting proximity effect and the like is employed to deal with the recent trend of finer lines. One solution for reducing the time and cost required for such remake of semiconductor IC devices, accordingly, is to reduce the number of masks to be newly prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To manufacture the semiconductor IC device of the new version in which the state of the switch has been changed with the above conventional technique, however, preparation of the new mask for the layer including the switch cannot be avoided as described above. Here, suppose that another defective is found in a layer other than the layer including the switch. According to the above conventional technique, a new mask for that layer also needs to be prepared for the purpose of correcting the defective. In this case, two new masks in total need to be prepared. This situation may be a failure in reducing the time and cost for manufacturing semiconductor IC devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problem, the present invention aims to provide a two-terminal circuit that is formed in a multilayer semiconductor IC device so as to extend over a plurality of layers thereof, and that makes it possible to manufacture a new two-terminal circuit that differs from the two-terminal circuit of the present invention in the state of a circuit part in one freely-chosen layer and accordingly in the signal transmission state being switched between the signal-transmittable state and the signal-untransmittable state. The two-terminal circuit of the present invention can therefore contribute to reducing the manufacturing time and cost. Further, the present invention aims to provide a semiconductor IC device including the above two-terminal circuit, a method for changing design information representing the above two-terminal circuit, and a design aiding device that provides an aid in changing design information representing the above two-terminal circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (1) A two-terminal circuit of the present invention is formed in a multilayer semiconductor integrated circuit device so as to extend over a plurality of layers thereof, and is characterized by including a plurality of signal paths, each of which is laid at one or more of the plurality of layers to connect two terminals of the circuit, and includes a restricted part at each of the one or more layers, the restricted part being formed either in (a) a connected state for permitting transmission of a signal at the restricted part of the signal path or in (b) a disconnected state for preventing transmission of a signal at the restricted part of the signal path, wherein each of the plurality of layers includes at least different one of the plurality of signal paths that is laid thereat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, each of the layers includes at least one different signal path that is laid thereat. Therefore, by forming one restricted part of the one different signal path laid at each layer to be in the disconnected state and all the other restricted parts to be in the connected state, a first two-terminal circuit that is in the state incapable of transmitting a signal can be manufactured. Based on the first two-terminal circuit, a second two-terminal circuit in which restricted parts included in a freely-chosen layer are in the connected state and that is in the state capable of transmitting a signal can be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The following is a case where a second semiconductor integrated circuit device including the second two-terminal circuit is to be manufactured based on a first semiconductor integrated circuit device including the first two-terminal circuit. Here, suppose that a mask for a specific layer needs to be newly prepared due to a defective found in the specific layer or the like. In this case, the state of restricted parts included in the specific layer may be changed, so that the second semiconductor integrated circuit device can be manufactured with a smaller number of masks to be newly prepared. As a result, the time and cost required for such remake of the semiconductor integrated circuit devices can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the above construction, even when such remake of the semiconductor integrated circuit devices is realized with a method that does not involve preparation of newmasks, such as a processing method utilizing FIB (Focused Ion Beam), the number of layers to be processed can still be reduced. In this case too, therefore, the time and cost required for such remake of the semiconductor integrated circuit devices can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (2) Also, in the two-terminal circuit described in the item (1), each signal path may be laid at and pass through all of the plurality of layers, to connect the two terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, each signal path in the two-terminal circuit includes one or more restricted parts included in each of the plurality of layers. Therefore, by providing a signal path whose restricted parts all are in the connected state, the first two-terminal circuit that is in the state capable of transmitting a signal can be manufactured. Based on the first two-terminal circuit, the second two-terminal circuit in which restricted parts included in one freely-chosen layer all are in the disconnected state and that is in the state incapable of transmitting a signal can be manufactured. As a result, the time and cost required for such remake of the circuits can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> (3) Also, in the two-terminal circuit described in the item (2), in each signal path, restricted parts in the plurality of layers may be formed in one of the following states where (a) restricted parts in all the layers are in the connected state, (b) a restricted part in one layer is in the disconnected state and restricted parts in layers other than the one layer are in the connected state, and (c) restricted parts in two layers are in the connected state and restricted parts in layers other than the two layers are in the connected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, when a new two-terminal circuit that differs in the signal transmission state is repeatedly manufactured, the new two-terminal circuit is made to include a suitable one of a signal path in the state (b) and a signal path in the state (c). By doing so, a new two-terminal circuit can be manufactured repeatedly an unlimited number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As a result of this, the time and cost required for such remake of a semiconductor integrated circuit device including the two-terminal circuit can be reduced over an unlimited number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (4) Also, in the two-terminal circuit described in the item (2), each signal path may be sequentially laid at and pass through adjacent layers of the plurality of layers, to connect the two terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, the two-terminal circuit has the effect of reducing the time and cost required for such remake of semiconductor integrated circuit devices. Further, each contact can be formed to have a thickness corresponding to one layer. In this case, the total length of the contacts can be minimized, and so the signal delay time of the two-terminal circuit can be shortened accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (5) A signal selection circuit of the present invention includes: a plurality of input terminals; a plurality of two-terminal circuits, each of which is a two-terminal circuit described in the item (1), and is provided in correspondence with different one of the input terminals, a first terminal of each two-terminal circuit being electrically connected to the corresponding input terminal; and an output terminal that is electrically connected to a second terminal of each two-terminal circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, one of the two-terminal circuits can be formed in the state capable of transmitting a signal and the other two-terminal circuits can be formed in the state incapable of transmitting a signal. By doing so, based on the signal selection circuit of the present invention that selects a predetermined signal, a signal selection circuit that differs from the signal selection circuit of the present invention in the state in one freely-chosen layer and that selects a signal other than the predetermined signal can be manufactured. As a result, the time and cost required for such remake of the circuit can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (6) A standard cell of the present invention is formed in a multilayer semiconductor integrated circuit device, including a two-terminal circuit described in the item (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, based on the standard cell of the present invention, a standard cell that differs from the standard cell of the present invention in the state in one freely-chosen layer and that includes a two-terminal circuit whose signal transmission state differs from that of a two-terminal circuit included in the standard cell of the present invention can be manufactured. As a result, the time and cost required for such remake of the standard cell can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (7) The standard cell described in the item (6) may include: a plurality of input terminals that are electrically connected to an outside of the standard cell; a plurality of two-terminal circuits, each of which is a two-terminal circuit described in the item (1), and is provided in correspondence with different one of the input terminals, a first terminal of each two-terminal circuit being electrically connected to the corresponding input terminal; and an output terminal that is electrically connected to a second terminal of each two-terminal circuit, and that is electrically connected to an outside of the standard cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, one of the two-terminal circuits can be formed in the state capable of transmitting a signal and the other two-terminal circuits can be formed in the state incapable of transmitting a signal.

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The following describes preferred embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> 1. First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A two-terminal circuit relating to a first embodiment of the present invention is incorporated in a semiconductor IC device with a multilayer structure. The two-terminal circuit is constructed by connecting a plurality of signal paths in parallel. Each signal path is laid at one or more of a plurality of layers to connect two terminals of the circuit, and includes a restricted area at each of the one or more layers. Each restricted part is formed either in (a) a connected state for permitting transmission of a signal at the restricted part of the signal path or in (b) a disconnected state for preventing transmission of a signal at the restricted part of the signal path. Here, each of the plurality of layers includes at least different one of the plurality of signal paths that is laid thereat. Each signal path is formed as being either in the state capable of transmitting a signal (signal-transmittable state) or in the state incapable of transmitting a signal (signal-untransmittable state), depending on the state of each restricted area included therein. As a result, the two-terminal circuit is formed as being either in the state capable of transmitting a signal between the two terminals (the connected state) or in the state incapable of transmitting a signal between the two terminals (the disconnected state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> 1.1 Construction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) is a top view showing, as one example, a layout of elements of a two-terminal circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is formed in a semiconductor IC device with a three-layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the figure, a first signal path, a second signal path, and a third signal path are shown in the stated order from top to bottom. Parts illustrated with different patterns <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are conductors respectively formed in a first layer, a second layer, and a third layer of the semiconductor IC device. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> denote restricted areas in the first layer. A reference numeral <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> denotes a restricted area in the second layer. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> denote restricted areas in the third layer. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> denote contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Each restricted area with a pattern is in the electrically connected state capable of transmitting a signal (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;in the ON-state&rdquo;). Each restricted area without any pattern is in the electrically disconnected state incapable of transmitting a signal (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;in the OFF-state&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The first signal path is roughly composed of the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the contact <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Here, the restricted area <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is in the OFF-state. This means that the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is divided by the restricted area in the OFF-state. Accordingly, the first signal path is in the signal-untransmittable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(B) is a sectional view showing the first signal path, and corresponds to an X-section of the top view.

A reference numeral <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> denotes a semiconductor substrate. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> denote insulators respectively formed in the first layer, the second layer, and the third layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The second signal path is roughly composed of the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the contact <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the contact <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Here, the restricted area <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is in the OFF-state. This means that the conductor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is divided by the restricted area in the OFF-state. Accordingly, the second signal path is in the signal-untransmittable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(C) is a sectional view showing the second signal path, and corresponds to a Y-section of the top view. The same explanation as above regarding the reference numerals is applied to this figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The third signal path in the above two-terminal circuit is roughly composed of the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and the contact <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Here, the restricted area <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is in the OFF-state. This means that the conductor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is divided by the restricted area in the OFF-state. Accordingly, the third signal path is in the signal-untransmittable state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> 1.4 Conclusions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> According to the construction described above, based on (1) a two-terminal circuit that is as a whole in the disconnected state, and in which on each signal path, one restricted area included in one layer is in the OFF-state and one or more restricted areas included in the other layers are in the ON-state, with the one restricted area in the OFF-state on each signal path being included in a different layer, a new two-terminal circuit that differs in the state of restricted areas included in one freely-chosen layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state can be constructed. Also, based on (2) a two-terminal circuit that is as a whole in the connected state, and in which all the restricted areas are in the ON-state, a new two-terminal circuit that differs in the state of restricted areas included in one freely-chosen layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state can be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> This means the following. When any one layer of a two-terminal circuit on which a new two-terminal circuit is based is set as a target layer, at least one set of masks necessary for manufacturing the new two-terminal circuit whose circuit state has been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state can be obtained, simply by preparing one new mask corresponding to the target layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The following is a case where it becomes necessary to manufacture a semiconductor IC device including such a new two-terminal circuit whose circuit state differs from that of the above two-terminal circuit. Here, suppose that a defective is found in a specific layer of the above two-terminal circuit and a new mask for this layer also needs to be prepared for the purpose of correcting the defective. In such a case, this defective layer can also serve as the above target layer. By choosing the defective layer as the target layer, therefore, only one new mask needs to be prepared for manufacturing the semiconductor IC device including the new two-terminal circuit. In this way, the present embodiment can reduce the number of new masks to be prepared, thereby reducing the time and cost required for such remake of semiconductor IC devices. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> A design method relating to a second embodiment of the present invention is for changing design information representing the two-terminal circuit described in the first embodiment, so as to represent a two-terminal circuit that differs from the two-terminal circuit described in the first embodiment in the state of restricted areas in one designated layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The design information is stored, for example, in a design information table <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In the design information table <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, columns correspond to signal paths, and rows correspond to layers. A &ldquo;layer number&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> shows a layer number for identifying a layer corresponding to each row. A&ldquo;signal path identification name&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> shows a signal path identification name for identifying a signal path corresponding to each column. A &ldquo;restricted area state&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, where a row and a column intersect with each other, shows one of symbols &ldquo;OFF&rdquo;, &ldquo;ON&rdquo;, and &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; for a restricted area included in a layer identified by the corresponding layer number on a signal path identified by the corresponding signal path identification name. The symbol &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; indicates that the restricted area is to be in the OFF-state, the symbol &ldquo;ON&rdquo; indicates that the restricted area is to be in the ON-state, and the symbol &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; indicates that such a restricted area is not present. </paragraph>

When one or more such signal paths are found, the processing advances to step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> According to this design method, the judgment can be performed as to whether (i) the design information representing the two-terminal circuit described in the first embodiment can be changed so as to represent a two-terminal circuit that differs from the two-terminal circuit described in the first embodiment in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state by changing the state of restricted areas in one designated layer, or (ii) such a change in the design information is impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> 3. Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> A two-terminal circuit relating to a third embodiment of the present invention is formed in a semiconductor IC device with a multilayer structure. The two-terminal circuit in the present embodiment has the same structure as the two-terminal circuit described in the first embodiment, except that each of the signal paths constituting the two-terminal circuit in the present embodiment is formed via every layer, i.e., each signal path includes a restricted area in every layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> 3.1 Construction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a top view showing, as one example, a layout of elements of a two-terminal circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that is formed in a semiconductor IC device with a three-layer structure. The two-terminal circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is constructed by connecting in parallel six signal paths, each of which includes one restricted area in every layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In the figure, a first signal path, a second signal path, . . . a sixth signal path are shown from top to bottom in the stated order. The same explanation regarding the illustration method and reference numerals as given for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) is applied to the figure. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> denote conductors respectively formed in the first layer and the third layer. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> denote restricted areas respectively provided in the first layer, the second layer, and the third layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The first signal path is roughly composed of the conductor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, the conductor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> including the restricted area <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, a contact that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and a contact that connects the conductor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the conductor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Here, the restricted area <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> is in the OFF-state. This means that the conductor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is divided by the restricted area in the OFF state. Accordingly, the first signal path is out of conduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The second to sixth signal paths each have conductors, restricted areas, and contacts that have the same positional relations with the corresponding elements of the first signal path.

To be specific, the first signal path, the second signal path, and the third signal path are respectively disconnected in the third layer, the second layer, and the first layer. Each of the fourth signal path, the fifth signal path, and the sixth signal path are respectively disconnected in two of the layers. To be specific, the fourth signal path, the fifth signal path, and the sixth signal path are respectively disconnected in the third and second layers, the third and first layers, and the second and first layers.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the two-terminal circuit <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the first signal path has not been restored to the state where it used to be in the standard two-terminal circuit, i.e., the state where the first signal path is disconnected only in the third layer. Such a signal path that is disconnected only in the third layer will be necessary when a new two-terminal circuit that is in the connected state is to be constructed by choosing the third layer as a target layer. To prepare such a signal path, the state of the restricted area <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> on the fifth signal path is switched to the ON-state. </paragraph>

Such a signal path that is disconnected in the first layer and the third layer will be necessary when a signal path that is disconnected in either one of the first layer and the third layer needs to be prepared.

<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Each signal path in the two-terminal circuit relating to the third embodiment includes a restricted area in every layer. According to this construction, when a new two-terminal circuit that differs from the two-terminal circuit on which the new-terminal circuit is based, in the state of restricted areas in one freely-chosen layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state is to be constructed, a signal path that is disconnected in one layer or a signal path that is disconnected in two layers is purposely prepared using a suitable signal path. A signal path that is disconnected in one layer and a signal path that is disconnected in two layers are to be prepared alternately one at every time when such a new-terminal circuit is to be constructed. By doing so, such a new two-terminal circuit can be constructed repeatedly. </paragraph>

A &ldquo;layer number&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> shows a layer number for identifying a layer corresponding to each row. A &ldquo;signal path identification name&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> shows a signal path identification name for identifying a signal path corresponding to each column. A &ldquo;restricted area state&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, where a row and a column intersect with each other, shows one of symbols &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; and &ldquo;ON&rdquo; for a restricted area included in a layer identified by the corresponding layer number on a signal path identified by the corresponding signal path identification name. The symbol &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; indicates that the restricted area is to be in the OFF-state, and the symbol &ldquo;ON&rdquo; indicates that the restricted area is to be in the ON-state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> According to this design method, the design information representing the two-terminal circuit described in the third embodiment can be changed so as to represent a two-terminal circuit that differs from the two-terminal circuit described in the third embodiment in the state of restricted areas in one designated layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The above design method includes the first preparation process for preparing a signal path that is disconnected in one layer using a signal path that is disconnected in two layers, and the second preparation process for preparing a signal path that is connected in two layers using a signal path that is disconnected in one layer. Therefore, the design information can be changed repeatedly so as to represent a new two-terminal circuit that differs in the state of restricted areas in one layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> 5. Fifth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> A design method relating to a fifth embodiment of the present invention is for suitably executing one or both of the first preparation process and the second preparation process described in the fourth embodiment, when the design information representing a standard two-terminal circuit is repeatedly changed so as to represent a new two-terminal circuit that differs in the state of restricted areas in one freely-chosen layer and in the circuit state having been switched between the disconnected state and the connected state. By doing so, such a change in the design information can be executed repeatedly an unlimited number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> The design method in the present embodiment uses a state expression showing the change record of the design information. According to this design method, the design information is subject to one or both of the first preparation process and the second preparation process that are judged as suitable in accordance with a designated target layer and the state expression, and at the same time, the state expression is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> 5.1 Design Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows design information representing a typical two-terminal circuit that is composed of a plurality of signal paths and that is formed in a semiconductor IC device with a multilayer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The design information is stored, for example, in a design information table <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. In the design information table <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, columns correspond to signal paths. A &ldquo;signal path identification name&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> shows a signal path identification name for identifying a signal path corresponding to each column. A &ldquo;signal path state&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> shows one of symbols &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ai&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Bij&rdquo; showing a signal path state of a signal path identified by the corresponding signal path identification name. The &ldquo;signal path state&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> indicates the state in which each restricted area on the signal path is to be formed. To be more specific, (1) the symbol &ldquo;C&rdquo; indicates that all restricted areas are to be formed in the ON-state, (2) the symbol &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; indicates that a restricted area in the i-th layer is to be formed in the OFF-state and restricted areas in the other layers are to be formed in the ON-state, and (3) the symbol &ldquo;Bij&rdquo; indicates that a restricted area in the i-th layer and a restricted area in the j-th layer that is different from the i-th layer are to be formed in the OFF-state, and restricted areas in the other layers are to be formed in the ON-state. Here, &ldquo;i&rdquo; and &ldquo;j&rdquo; are specific numbers. From the definition, &ldquo;Bij and &ldquo;Bji&rdquo; are identical to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The design information table <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> stores, as one example, design information that represents a standard two-terminal circuit with a three-layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> 5.2 State Expression </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The state expression is composed of a constant term &ldquo;S&rdquo; that indicates the initial state of the two-terminal circuit and constant terms &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, . . . , &ldquo;B<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, . . . that indicate the above mentioned signal path states, connected using connectors &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo;,&ldquo;&minus;&rdquo;, &ldquo;(&rdquo;, and &ldquo;)&rdquo;. The state expression shows the number of signal paths that are included in the design information and that are in each of the above signal path states, and also shows the change record of the design information. The state expression is updated when the design information is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The following describes in detail the state expression showing the number of signal paths in each of the above signal path states, and the change record. The constant term &ldquo;S&rdquo; indicates that the standard two-terminal circuit includes one signal path that is in each of the signal path states A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , and B<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, . . . . Each of the other constant terms connected using the connector &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; indicates an increase in the number of signal paths that are in the state indicated by the constant term, from the number of such signal paths in the standard two-terminal circuit. Each of the other constant terms connected using the symbol &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; indicates a decrease in the number of signal paths that are in the state indicated by the constant term, from the number of such signal paths in the standard two-terminal circuit. A range defined by the symbols &ldquo;(&ldquo;and&rdquo;)&rdquo; indicates an increase and a decrease in the number of signal paths in each signal path state resulting from each change of the design information (i.e., the change record of each signal path state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> As one specific example, the state expression is expressed as &ldquo;S&plus;(C&minus;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&rdquo;. This state expression indicates the following change record of the design information. Assuming the number of signal paths included in the design information representing the standard two-terminal circuit as the initial state, the number of signal paths that are in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; state has increased by one, and the number of signal paths that are in the &ldquo;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; state has decreased by one. Along with this, a signal path in the &ldquo;A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; state included in the design information representing the standard two-terminal circuit has been changed to a signal path that is in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> 5.3 Transformation Rules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a table showing the correspondence between (a) a transformation rule that is applied to the state expression in accordance with a designated target layer and the state expression, and (b) a change in design information to be made when the transformation rule is applied. A &ldquo;rule&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> shows a rule name that identifies a transformation rule. A &ldquo;state expression update&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> shows a transformation rule. A &ldquo;design information change&rdquo; field <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> shows a change in the design information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Transformation rules &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; and &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied when design information representing a two-terminal circuit that is in the disconnected state is changed so as to represent a two-terminal circuit that is in the connected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Transformation rules &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied when design information representing a two-terminal circuit that is in the connected state is changed so as to represent a two-terminal circuit that is in the disconnected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The following first describes each transformation rule in detail, and describes the overall processing, and then, proves that the corresponding change in the design information can be repeated an unlimited number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> 5. 3. 1 Transformation Rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is expressed as </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> where &ldquo;k&rdquo; is a layer number identifying the target layer, &ldquo;x&rdquo; is a freely-chosen layer number that is different from &ldquo;k&rdquo;, &ldquo;T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;(Ax&minus;Bkx)&rdquo; is the state expression, &ldquo;T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is a partial expression included in the state expression, and &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bkx&rdquo; are constant terms included in the state expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied to a case where the state expression includes a constant term &ldquo;&plus;(Ax&minus;Bkx)&rdquo; for the freely-chosen layer number &ldquo;x&rdquo; that is different from &ldquo;k&rdquo;. Note that the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(Ax&minus;Bkx)&rdquo; has been generated when the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; was applied, and the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(Ax&minus;Bkx)&rdquo; indicates the change record that the first preparation process previously performed on the design information has resulted in a signal path in the &ldquo;Bkx&rdquo; state being changed to a signal path in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> When the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied, the state expression is updated to the partial expression &ldquo;T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; as the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(Ax&minus;Bkx)&rdquo; is removed from the state expression. At the same time, the second preparation process in the change-to-connection process is performed on the design information. This results in the signal path in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state being changed to the signal path in the &ldquo;Bkx&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> 5.3.2 Transformation Rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is expressed as </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> where &ldquo;k&rdquo; is a layer number identifying the target layer, &ldquo;T&rdquo; is the state expression, and &ldquo;Ak&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; are constant terms included in the state expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied to any case, regardless of a constant term included in the state expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> When the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied, the state expression is updated to the expression &ldquo;T&plus;(C&minus;Ak)&rdquo; as the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(C&minus;Ak)&rdquo; is added to the state expression.

<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> 5.5 Proof that Change is Possible Unlimited Number of Times </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> The following describes that a change in the design information corresponding to an applied transformation rule is always possible, when the design information representing the standard two-terminal circuit and the state expression &ldquo;S&rdquo; are set as the initial state and the processing shown in the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is repeatedly executed. As described above, the state expression corresponding to each change of the design information indicates the number of signal paths that are included in the design information and that are in each signal path state, by an increase or a decrease from those of the standard two-terminal circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Referring now back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, to enable the corresponding change in design information to be made when the transformation rules &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> &rdquo;, &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied, the design information needs to include, respectively, a signal path in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state, a signal path in the &ldquo;Ak&rdquo; state, a signal path in the &ldquo;Ay&rdquo; state, a signal path in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; state, and signal paths in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; state and the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> The transformation rules &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied to a case where the design information and the state expression are in the initial state, or to a case where the design information shows the disconnected state immediately after the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; or the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; has been applied. At this point, the state expression does not include a constant term &ldquo;&plus;(C&minus;Ax)&rdquo; for any layer number &ldquo;x&rdquo;, as the state expression is &ldquo;S&rdquo; in the initial state or the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(C&minus;Ax)&rdquo; has been removed from the state expression corresponding to the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; or &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. Because the state expression does not include a constant term &ldquo;&minus;Ax&rdquo; that indicates a decrease in the number of signal paths in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state, the state expression to which the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied indicates that the design information includes at least two signal paths in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state. Also, because the state expression does not include a constant term &ldquo;&minus;Ax&rdquo; that indicates a decrease in the number of signal paths in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state, the state expression to which the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied indicates that the design information includes at least one signal path in the &ldquo;Ak&rdquo; state. Accordingly, a change in the design information corresponding to the applied transformation rule is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The transformation rules &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied to a case where the design information shows the connected state immediately after the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; has been applied. At this point, the state expression includes one constant term &ldquo;&plus;(C&minus;Ax)&rdquo; for a certain layer number &ldquo;x&rdquo;, as the constant term &ldquo;&plus;(C&minus;Ax)&rdquo; has been added to the state expression, corresponding to the transformation rule &ldquo;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. Because the state expression includes one constant term &ldquo;&minus;Ax&rdquo; for the certain layer number &ldquo;x&rdquo;, the state expression to which the transformation expression &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied indicates that the design information includes at least one signal path in the &ldquo;Ax&rdquo; state. Accordingly, a change &ldquo;Ax&rarr;Bmx&rdquo; in the design information is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> The state expression in a case where the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; and the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; are applied indicates that the design information includes a signal path in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; state. Accordingly, a change &ldquo;C&rarr;Am&rdquo; in the design information is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> A change &ldquo;Bmy&rarr;Ay&rdquo; in the design information corresponding to the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is apparently possible when this change is made for the first time and so a signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state is included in the design information. However, when this change is made for the second time or later and so the signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state has been lost in the design information, a signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state becomes necessary. In view of this, a signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state is prepared without fail in the following way, before the signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state becomes necessary as a change target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> A signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state becomes necessary as a change target in the case where the change-to-connection process using the y-th layer as the target layer and the change-to-disconnection process using the m-th layer as the target layer are continuously executed after a signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state is lost. A signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; state also becomes necessary as a change target in the case where the change-to-connection process using the m-th layer as the target layer and the change-to-disconnection process using the y-th layer as the target layer are continuously executed. To be specific, the signal path in the &ldquo;Bmy&rdquo; becomes necessary as a change target at the point when the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo; is applied in the change-to-disconnection process in either of the above cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> The state expression corresponding to the design information from which the signal path in the Bmy state is removed is expressed as &ldquo;T&plus;(Am&minus;Bmy)&rdquo; or &ldquo;T&plus;(Ay&minus;Bmy)&rdquo;. Here, &ldquo;T&rdquo; no longer includes &ldquo;&minus;Bmy&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> The following describes various cases where a signal path in the Bmy state is prepared before such a signal path becomes necessary in correspondence with the transformation rule &ldquo;g<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. </paragraph>

In this case, the first functional block <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> receives encrypted digital content information and decrypts the encrypted digital content information using a decryption circuit <highlight><bold>961</bold></highlight>, and outputs the decrypted digital content information to the second functional block <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>. The second functional block <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight> converts the decrypted digital content information into analogue video and audio signals, and outputs the analogue video and audio signals to outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> Here, the decrypted digital content information needs to be concealed from the user in view of copyright protection. If the user obtains such information, he or she who is not authorized to duplicate the information may be able to unlimitedly duplicate the information without deterioration of the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> It is extremely difficult for the user to obtain such information when the semiconductor IC device <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> does not have the construction to output the information to outside. The semiconductor IC device without such construction is accordingly preferable in view of copyright protection. However, there may be a case where the developer of the semiconductor IC device <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> wishes to obtain the information for the purpose of verifying the operations of the device. Taking such a case into consideration, the semiconductor IC device <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> includes the verification data output block <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> The verification data output block <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight> encrypts the decrypted digital content information using an encryption circuit <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight> based on key information that has been generated by a key generation circuit <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight> according to the state of a two-terminal circuit group <highlight><bold>983</bold></highlight>, to generate verification information. Further, a signal selection circuit <highlight><bold>984</bold></highlight> outputs one of the decrypted digital content information and the verification information to an output circuit <highlight><bold>985</bold></highlight>. The output circuit <highlight><bold>985</bold></highlight> outputs the information that has been inputted by the signal selection circuit <highlight><bold>984</bold></highlight>, to outside of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> Here, the two-terminal circuit group <highlight><bold>983</bold></highlight> is constructed by using such two-terminal circuits that are described in the first or third embodiment. The signal selection circuit <highlight><bold>984</bold></highlight> is the signal selection circuit described in the eighth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, the decrypted digital content information can be outputted as being converted into the verification information, the contents of which can be concealed from the user. Alternatively, the decrypted digital content information can be outputted as it is at the prototyping stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> In particular, a switch between the verification information and the decrypted digital content information to be outputted can be performed by the remake with a change in one freely-chosen layer of a two-terminal circuit. Therefore, at the transfer from the prototyping stage to the manufacturing state, a layer in which a final correction of a defective has been performed can be used to realize the above switch between the decrypted digital content information and the verification information, without increasing the number of masks to be newly prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> Also, the key information used to generate the verification information can be changed using one freely-chosen layer of a two-terminal circuit. Therefore, encryption reliability of the verification information can be maintained by, for example, changing the key information using the layer in which a correction of another defective has been performed, without increasing the number of masks to be newly prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> Modifications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention is described based on the above embodiments, it should be clear that the present invention is not limited to the above specific embodiments. For example, the following modifications are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> (1) The present invention may be realized by a method including the steps described in the above embodiments. Also, the method may be realized by a computer program that can be executed using a computer system, or may be realized by a digital signal representing the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention may be realized by a computer-readable recording medium on which the program or the digital signal is recorded. Examples of the computer-readable recording medium include a flexible disk, a hard disk, a CD-ROM, an MO, a DVD, a DVD-ROM, a DVD-RAM, and a semiconductor memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> Also, the computer program or the digital signal may be transmitted via a telephone communication line, a radio or cable communication line, or a network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention may be a computer system including a microprocessor, and a memory that stores the program. The above method may be realized by the microprocessor operating in accordance with the program stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> Also, the program and the digital signal may be transferred as being recorded on the recording medium, or via the network and the like, and may be executed in another independent computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> (2) For each signal path in the two-terminal circuit described in the third embodiment, restricted areas formed in adjacent layers may be sequentially connected in series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, each contact can be formed to have a thickness corresponding to one layer. In this case, the total length of the contacts can be minimized, and so the signal delay time of the two-terminal circuit can be shortened accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described byway of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. </paragraph>
