<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">I. BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fruit damage can occur during handling, packing, transporting, or storing fruit and is primarily caused by either mechanical impact or compression forces. Merely holding fruit can cause bruising and fruit pickers are trained to touch fruit only by the fruit stem. Damage to loose stone fruit, such as peaches or avocados, can be caused by the stone, pit, or seed(s) moving inside the fruit during handling, packing, or transportation resulting in internal damage which may not be visible until the fruit is cut or eaten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Damage to fruit can be immediately apparent at the time when it is cut, crushed, or punctured. However, other types of damage may not be apparent for a period of time, such as, fruit pitting associated with damage to cells near the epidermis that collapse over a period of time or fruit bruising associated with injury to cells much below the epidermis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Upon being damaged fruit respiration and ethylene production increases making the fruit more susceptible to decay. Bruising can also result in localized softening of the fruit, the presence of secondary microbial infection, and increased acidity compared to undamaged fruit. Discoloration of fruit results when an enzyme called polyphenoloxidase oxidizes the phenolic compounds that are found in the tissue of fruits. The oxidation causes the phenolic compounds to condense into brown spots. While the tissue, or cell structure, remains intact, the enzyme and phenolic compounds are separated and so do not react with one another. Damage of the cell structure caused by impact or compression of the fruit initiates the oxidation reaction and so triggers the onset of browning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because fruit are delicate and susceptible to damage numerous types of containers, carriers, holders, or hangers have been devised to reduce damage to fruit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Containers, crates, or boxes are commonly used to transport or store fruit. Such containers, crates, or boxes are typically formed of injection molded plastic(s) or paperboard(s). When assembled, such containers are typically rectangular in shape, having a flat base surrounded by four upstanding flat side panels as disclosed for example by U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,286,701; 5,431,335; 6,394,296; 6,015,056; or 6,398,054. More familiar to the individual consumer is the sandwich, lunch, or storage container having a releasably sealable cover as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,452. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A significant problem with these types of containers can be that fruit placed inside can move, shift, or vibrate in response to movement of the container. Even fruits having a thick skin or a peel, such as a banana, can be damaged by movement or vibration within a container causing the fruit to abrade, become soft, or discolor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A conventional solution to protect fruit transported in such containers, crates, or boxes, may be a flexible liner inserted into the container prior to placing the fruit within as disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,617,711 or 6,247,328. However, a problem with flexible liners made from thin plastic sheet material as disclosed may be that it does not absorb incident impact or compression forces. Unabsorbed impact or compression forces can be transmitted through the liner to that portion of the exterior surface of the fruit in contact with the flexible liner. Another problem with flexible liner material may be that it does not provide sufficient frictional engagement with the exterior surface of the fruit to prevent movement of the fruit relative to the liner allowing fruit damage by impact, compression, vibration, or abrasion forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the bottom or side panels of the containers, crates, or boxes may be made flexible to conform to the fruit pressing against them as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,386,388. However, flexure of a container panel as disclosed may not provide sufficient absorption of incident forces to protect fruit in contact with the flexible panel. The lack of a compressible surface may in large part allow transmission of impact or compression forces through the panel to the fruit. Moreover, flexible panels may not generate sufficient frictional engagement with the fruit to prevent damage from fruit movement relative to the flexible panel as above described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Containers, crates, or boxes that provide rigid recesses or cups for individual fruit, as disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,653,345 or Des. 328,705 are configured such that an individual recess or cup or each of a plurality of recesses or cups is formed with a substantially identical shape or volume. Because individual pieces of fruit vary in size and shape, rigid containers may not have surfaces that conform to the exterior surface of individual pieces of fruit. Additionally, there may not be sufficient frictional engagement with the exterior surface of the fruit to prevent movement within the individual recess or cup. Moreover, the walls of rigid recesses or cups may not afford the degree of compressibility necessary to absorb forces of impact generated by movement of the fruit within the recess or cup, as such fruit damage may not be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Because containers, crates, or boxes typically do not operate to protect fruit in isolation but rather act in concert with the larger conveyance in which they are transported, such as a truck or a ship, it is understandable that such containers, crates, or boxes do not provide additional impact and compression force absorption elements that may already provided by the functional structure of the truck, ship, or other conveyance, as such they can be lacking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Similarly, conventional films that wrap, cling, stretch, or shrink to conform to a portion of the exterior surface of fruits or vegetables, such as the film technology disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,144, provide a thin and substantially non-compressible material that present surfaces that may not afford a sufficient degree of resiliency or compression to absorb incident impact or compression forces to prevent or minimize fruit damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Conventional fruit and berry pickers&apos; containers such as those disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,201,446 and 4,184,528, are configured to allow collection of numerous fruit in a single enclosed volume. As such, these types of containers are not configured to conform to the exterior surface of individual pieces of fruit or provide a sufficient amount of frictional engagement with the fruit to prevent or minimize movement of the fruit within the container which can result in pitting or bruising of the fruit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Relating to fruit protection technology in general, and specifically with regard to a force absorption system for fruit that provides sufficient force absorption characteristics, conformability characteristics, frictional engagement characteristics, to protect individual pieces of fruit, bunches of fruit, or loose fruit, such as berries, cherries, or grapes when handled, transported, or stored, it can be understood there are an array of fruit protection problems that remain unresolved. The numerous embodiments of the invention address each these above-mentioned problems. </paragraph>

A blowing agent can be used introduce the catalyst into the polymer or foamable material to generate foaming which establishes cells or voids in the foam material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Foam material suitable for use with the invention can have either an &ldquo;open cell&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed cell&rdquo;. For example, polyurethane foam can be manufactured to have an &ldquo;open cell&rdquo; that provides numerous voids within the foam material through which gases or liquids can pass through. Alternately, for example, latex foam can be manufactured with a &ldquo;closed cell&rdquo; that does not allow gases or liquids to pass through. Often closed cell foam is referred to as &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; foam material because it will not allow liquids to pass through the cells or voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The density of a foam material is determined by dividing the foam material weight by its volume. The density can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the cell volume or void volume within the foam material. Low-density foam material is generally considered to have a density of 1.9 pounds per cubic foot or less. High-density foam material is generally considered to be a density of 2.0 pounds per cubic foot or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Compression characteristics of foam material can be measured by exerting force against the foam material with a flat compression foot larger than the footprint of the foam material specimen tested. These tests measure the pounds of force it takes to compress the foam material. A value called the Compression Force Deflection (CFD) or Compression Load Deflection (CLD) can be expressed as pounds of force exerted at 25%, 40%, 50%, or 65% compression of the foam material. The higher the CLD number the firmer the foam. Firmness can be controlled by the way the foam material is formulated, whereas density is determined by the total weight of foam ingredients per unit volume. Moreover, density and compression are not related. You can have either a soft foam material or a firm foam material at the same density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Resiliency corresponds to the spring the foam has, surface liveliness or spring-back ability. Resiliency is measured with a Ball Rebound test. A steel ball is dropped onto the foam material sample from a fixed height. Resiliency is expressed as a percentage of ball rebound against the original height of the ball drop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The invention can be practiced using foam material(s) having numerous combinations or permutations of density, compression, or resiliency, whether open cell or closed cell, so long as the cured foam material can be molded, or can be cut, to provide the fruit protector blank (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) with at least one substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) which can be conformed to at least a portion of the exterior surface of a fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures between about 32&deg; F. and about 120&deg; F. Depending on the exterior surface configuration of the fruit and the degree of conformance to the exterior surface of such fruit necessary or desired, the formulation of the foam material may be altered accordingly by varying: the polymer, the catalyst, the degree of density, the CDL, or resiliency until the degree of conformance to the exterior surface of the fruit, whether necessary or desired, is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Certain embodiments of the invention can further comprise a foam material that can be heat formed to induce the foam material to maintain a conformation that corresponds to a portion of the exterior surface of a particular fruit, or makes conformance of the foam material with the exterior surface of the fruit more readily obtainable, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The description of foam material provided is not intended to limit the scope of the invention only to foam material as described above and can be practiced using numerous types or kinds of resiliently compressible materials that can be cut, configured, and then conformed to the exterior of a fruit as described, such as, bubble type materials (e.g. bubble pack), flex channel material (e.g. flex channel), or the like. </paragraph>

Color coding the fruit protector blank (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or fruit protector surface can provide a correspondence between the color of the fruit protector and the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) it is intended to protect. For example, a banana protector blank or banana protector can be colored yellow, an apple protector red, an orange protector orange, a pear protector green, and so forth. Coloring the resiliently compressible force absorption material can also be useful in attracting consumers to purchase the fruit protector or the corresponding fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

The waste material storage (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) can provide a pocket or enclosure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> for storage of waste material. A closure can be coupled to the waste material storage to retain waste material inside the waste material storage (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The invention can further include a securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) by which the fruit protector can be coupled to a discrete surface, object, article of clothing, container, or transportation means. The securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) can comprise a mechanical fastener, such as a clip or clamp, having a pair of discrete compression surfaces to which force is applied in opposing directions, or can comprise a single discrete compression surface opposing the exterior surface of the fruit protector. Alternately, the securement can comprise a clasp as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Securement as to some embodiments of the invention can comprise a first securement element which operably mates to a second securement element. Various types of operably mated securement elements can be used, such as, a clasp that mates to an eyelet; a hook element that mates with a loop element; a hasp mated to a staple; a latch that engages a catch; or other similar securement elements that contribute a first securement element that can be coupled to a location on the fruit protector and provide a second securement element that can be coupled to a location on the discrete surface. The first and second securement element can in some cases be interchanged. For example, a clasp could be joined to either the discrete surface or to the fruit protector. In other instances, the first and second securement element cannot be interchanged, for example, the belt loop on pair of pants will reasonably require an operably mated clasp coupled to the fruit protector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With respect to particular embodiments of the invention, fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) retained within the fruit protector can have securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) engaged to a article of clothing, garment, or accessory worn by an animal, including, but not limited to a human, a donkey, a burro, a cat, or the like. One embodiment of the invention provides a securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) as above-described between the fruit protector and the harness or collar worn by an animal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Now referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the numerous embodiments of the fruit protector invention can be used by positioning a fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) such as a banana, an apple, or a pear, or other fruit on the substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) provide by the resiliently compressible force absorption material that makes up the fruit protector blank (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) can then be conformed to a portion of the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Sufficient frictional engagement between the substantially planar surface now conformed to the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) can be obtained to retain the fruit within the foam material and a closure (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) can be engaged to maintain the frictional engagement between the conformed fruit protector blank (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) can be subsequently removed from the fruit protector by disengaging the closure (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) that maintains frictional engagement between the portion of the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the resiliently compressible force absorption material conformed to the portion of the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Reducing the frictional engagement between the portion of the exterior of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the resiliently compressible force absorption material conformed to the exterior surface of the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) allows the conformed surface of the resiliently compressible foam material to return to a substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) configuration. The fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) may then be removed from a position on the substantially planar surface (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), inedible waste material from the fruit, such as peels or labels can be removed and the edible portion of the fruit exposed then consumed. </paragraph>

The container (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) can comprise a container for meals, such as plastic container typically used for storage of meals (e.g. Tupperware&reg; like container) which can have a sealably removable lid; a bag made of a material of sufficient strength and resistance to puncture or tear to allow fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) within a fruit protector to be held within (e.g. Gore-tex&reg; like or Windstopper&reg; like fabrics); a lunch pail or lunch box made of metal, plastic, or the like; or other similar container(s). By securing the fruit protector retaining fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) to the inside of a container (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), or to an article of clothing, a garment, or other accessory, transportation of the fruit is achieved by moving the container or by movement of the animal. An article of clothing, a garment, or other accessory is not mean to limit the invention to those types of clothing or garments that are typically worn, but rather this meant to be generic and meant to include for example children&apos;s toys such as belts, tool belts, costumes, uniforms, ammunition holders; jewelry (including toy or children&apos;s jewelry or charm bracelets); hand held toys such as water guns, jump ropes, or the like; back packs; purses or totes, or other similar types of accessory items to which a fruit protector could be attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Now referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, embodiments of the invention having securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) can be configured to be coupled together. For example, a banana protector can be made responsive to an apple protector. Any number or kind of fruit protectors can be linked together as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Again referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the invention can further comprise a kit (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) to protect fruit. The kit can include any of the various embodiments of the fruit protector inventions described above, such as, a fruit protector blank (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) having a resiliently compressible force absorption material having at least one planar surface configured to operably conform to a portion of the exterior surface of a fruit with a closure coupled to the resiliently compressible force absorption material which operates to maintain sufficient frictional engagement between the planar surface of the resiliently compressible force absorption material and the exterior surface of the fruit to retain the fruit within the resiliently compressible force absorption material; or a fruit protector having a molded force absorption cover (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) elastically conformable to a portion of the exterior surface of a fruit; or can be compatible with other types of fruit protection systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The kit further includes a container (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) in which a fruit protector or a plurality of fruit protector(s) can be located. The container can be a shipping container, such as boxes, cartons, flats, or the like; or can be a container for meals, such as plastic container typically used for storage of meals (e.g. Tupperware&reg; like container) which can have a sealably removable lid; a bag made of a material of sufficient strength and resistance to puncture or tear to allow fruit within a fruit protector to be held within (e.g. Gore-tex&reg; like or Windstopper&reg; like fabrics); a lunch pail or lunch box made of metal, plastic, or the like; or other similar container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The kit further includes operably mateable securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) between the fruit protector and the container having a first securement element coupled to resiliently flexible force absorption material of the invention or the exterior surface of other types of fruit protection systems that operably mate with a second securement element coupled to the container. Various types of mateable securement or mechanical fasteners can be used, such as, a clasp that mates to an eyelet; a hook element that mates with a loop element; a hasp mated to a staple; a latch having a bar falling or sliding into a catch, groove, or hole; or other similar securement elements or fasteners. The first and second securement element can in some cases be interchanged. For example, the clasp could be joined to either the container or the fruit protector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Once the fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is retained within the fruit protector, the fruit protector with the fruit (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) can be secured to the container (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) by mating the first securement element with the second securement element. The securement (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) of the fruit protector to the container (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) provides a tether that reduces movement of the fruit protector within the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Now referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the invention can comprise methods of marketing fruit. In a basic embodiment of the marketing invention, at least one kind of fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is displayed proximate to one of the fruit protector embodiments of the invention or kit (<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) above-described or claimed, or other type of fruit containment (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) or protection system. In some embodiments of the marketing invention, at least one of the fruits (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) displayed corresponds to a fruit protector in which the fruit can be retained, protected, or transported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Proximately displaying a fruit protector corresponding to at least one kind of fruit (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) can further comprise arranging a plurality of the fruit protectors (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) in a manner similar to the manner in which the fruit is displayed (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>). For example, if bananas are displayed in bunches, then the banana fruit protector can be configured in similar bunches and displayed in a manner similar to the bunches of bananas displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Now referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, alternately, the fruit protectors can be arranged in the manner that the fruit grows in the natural environment. Again without limiting the invention to bananas only, a bunch of banana protectors (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) could be hung from a artificial banana tree (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). Similarly, apple protectors can be hung from an artificial tree, or similarly pineapple protectors could be supported by an artificial pineapple plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Now referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, certain embodiments of the fruit marketing invention can further provide that a plurality of fruit protectors can be arranged in a hammock (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) suspended between a pair, or more, of supports (<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). The supports could be configured to represent trees in certain embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the invention can further comprise a berry or loose fruit protector comprising a molded force absorption cover (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) into which berries (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) can be transferred. A handle (<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) can be joined to the fruit protector to allow conveyance of the fruit protector. </paragraph>

Regarding this last aspect, as but one example, the disclosure of a &ldquo;fruit protector&rdquo; should be understood to encompass disclosure of the act of &ldquo;protecting fruit&rdquo;&mdash;whether explicitly discussed or not&mdash;and, conversely, were there only disclosure of the act of &ldquo;protecting fruit&rdquo;, such a disclosure should be understood to encompass disclosure of a &ldquo;fruit protector&rdquo; and even a &ldquo;means for protecting fruit&rdquo;. Such changes and alternative terms are to be understood to be explicitly included in the description. Additionally, the various combinations and permutations of all elements or applications can be created and presented. All can be done to optimize the design or performance in a specific application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Any acts of law, statutes, regulations, or rules mentioned in this application for patent; or patents, publications, or other references mentioned in this application for patent, are each hereby incorporated by reference.
