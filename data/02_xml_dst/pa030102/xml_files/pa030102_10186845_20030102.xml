<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention comprises a sealing device for a container having an essentially flat opening area, an opening tab formed in the opening area and an opening device attached at a connection point in the opening area. Moreover, through leverage action, the sealing device is arranged to press down the opening tab in the opening area so that it creates an opening therein, whereupon the opening device, after having created the opening, is arranged to provide resealing of the opening in such a way that the opening device is twisted around the connection point in parallel with the opening area until it reaches the resealing position where it seals the opening with a covering surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">KNOWN TECHNOLOGY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such sealing devices are usually found on what are often called returnable aluminium cans. Since the contents of such a can is often not completely consumed immediately after opening, it is desirable to, in a simple manner, be able to reseal the can so that the rest of its contents can be used later with reduced risk for its having been affected in any way from external sources. It should be noted that glasses are sometimes not used to drink the contents of cans. Instead, many people drink directly from the cans themselves. This applies, not least, to soft drink cans in the summer when there is risk that wasps, for example, will get into the cans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A re-sealable sealing device of the type set forth in the above introduction is known previously through U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,129. In this resealing device, the opening device can be blocked in the resealing position by having a recessed covering surface pressed down into the opening so that it engages the edge of the opening. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE OF AN EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The returnable cans <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in the drawings are basically of the pop-top type that has been known for 35 years, on which an opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is joined to the can cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a connection point configured as a rivet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formulated in the surface of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An opening tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is created by means of a score <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the essentially flat opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, said score <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having, typically, a depth of less than half of the thickness of the material in opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The can is opened in the known way by pressing down, through leverage action, on the opening tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such pressure being exerted via the inner end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that score <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> splits loose and tab <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pressed down into can <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby creating opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is lifted at its outer end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. To make it easier for score <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to split loose completely during the opening operation, reinforcing grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are usually provided on both sides of score <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, these grooves can also be omitted, and in such case the can cover may perhaps be made of thicker material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While the opening device on known returnable cans is usually shaped like an internally open ring, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in accordance with this invention, is shaped as a disc/plate comprising a covering surface. This covering surface is larger than the area of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, after the opening operation, can be twisted a half revolution around connection point <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and then fully cover opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. More precisely, after the opening operation, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is first pressed back against opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and then twisted in the direction shown by the arrow to the resealing position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. No modification of the connection comprising rivet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is needed to make this twisting possible since, in the form known today, it already allows twisting of the internally open ring relative to the can cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is angled upward somewhat at outer end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to make it easier to insert a fingertip under opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the opening operation. To avoid risk that the user will cut him/herself on the edges of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it can either be made of thicker material or the edges can be bent to form rounded edges as shown at <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the enlarged area in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, these rounded edges can extend all the way around the periphery (not shown) of the opening device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although there may be sufficient resealing if opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is quite simply only twisted to the resealing position, extra assurance is provided in the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by making opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> blockable at the resealing position. More precisely, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a pair of slits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> designed with blocking tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> respectively, and these tabs provide blocking engagement beneath the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Also as shown in the enlarged area in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (only tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown) can, if so desired, be bent slightly down relative to the remaining part of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that they themselves engage beneath the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> approaches the resealing position. Preferably, slits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are somewhat longer than slits <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, thereby permitting a certain amount of over-twisting of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> past the resealing position during the engagement of tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> before tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement by an equivalent reverse-twisting to the resealing position so that there will be two-sided blocking of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the resealing position. Opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be released by opposite reverse-twisting past the resealing position and slight lifting so that tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is released from the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and so that opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can then be twisted back clockwise a half revolution to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As a rule, allowing only tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to come into one-sided engagement will provide adequate sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has instead, for single-sided engagement, a projecting tongue <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that provides blocking engagement under the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the resealing position. As also indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, notches can, but do not necessarily have to, be arranged on the sides of the tongues plus one additional tongue at the opposite side of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to provide two-sided blocking of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The tongue can also be pointed downwards or designed with a vertical surface (not shown) that forms a stop vis-a-vis the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the resealing position. Moreover, both sides of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be arranged with a downward-pointing tongue to provide two-sided blocking of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the edge of opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a surrounding, bent thickening/reinforcing edge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; instead of the U&quest;shaped reinforcing groove <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Reinforcing edge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; extends, in a way not shown, along the under-side of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> somewhat below the plane of its covering surface so that, by means of a certain amount of fast-snapping catch action, it will collaborate with reinforcing groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which extends around opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the resealing position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. To hold opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> more securely in place at the resealing position, a rounded, raised projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is arranged in opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that it will engage the under-side of the inner end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the resealing position and, with a leverage action, elastically press the opening device against opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. While the returnable can is unopened, raised projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can serve to keep the outer end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> angled somewhat upwards to make it easier to insert a fingertip under opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the opening operation. For this purpose, opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be provided with a local depression <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Instead of raised projection <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in opening area <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a downward projecting, rounded section (not shown) having essentially the same function can be arranged at the inner end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although opening device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can fulfil its function without necessarily requiring a gas-tight and watertight seal for opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the resealing position, if so desired it is possible to provide a sealing coating of suitable plastic material on its under-side (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although the sealing device has been illustrated and described in connection with returnable cans, it is not limited to them. Neither is it limited to containers mate of sheet metal. Instead, it is possible to use it with other materials such as plastics. The claims that follow set forth the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
