<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication terminal, and in particular, to a method for storing and transmitting voice mails using a simple voice message/mail service (hereinafter, referred to as SVMS) in a mobile communication terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These days, the mobile communication terminal has evolved into a multimedia apparatus capable of providing not only a simple telephone call service but also a variety of additional services including electronic diary function, game function, schedule management function, etc. Furthermore, such a mobile communication terminal provides an Internet search function and an e-mail service function via wireless Internet, offering a great convenience to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the e-mail service using the mobile communication terminal can transmit only text and voice messages, while an existing PC-to-PC e-mail service can transmit voice messages, image messages and motion pictures as well as text messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, voice messages need a greater memory capacity than text messages, so a conventional mobile communication terminal requires a high-capacity memory to provide a voice mail service. In addition, it takes a long time to store and reproduce the voice messages, compared with the text messages. Furthermore, a voice data transmitted to the mobile communication terminal as a voice message is stored in a queue or buffer without an extension, and then read for reproduction by calling an associated parameter, and therefore, the voice data is not compatible with a PC (Personal Computer). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for transmitting a voice mail in a mobile communication terminal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In addition, following description and accompanied drawings showing specific details such as processing flow are provided to assist better understanding of the present invention. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a mobile communication terminal to which an embodiment of the present invention is applied. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> controls an overall operation of a mobile communication terminal. A memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> stores a control program for controlling an overall operation of the mobile communication terminal, and also stores in a specific storage area thereof the data inputted and outputted during execution of the control program by the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Specifically, voice messages/mails received from or to be sent to another mobile communication terminal are compressed into voice data having a specific extension and then stored in the memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. A duplexer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> performs communication with a base station via an antenna ANT, and separates transmission signals and reception signals. A receiver <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives radio signals inputted from the antenna ANT under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. To be specific, the receiver <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the low-power radio signals separated by the duplexer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, amplifies the received low-power radio signals and then filters the amplified radio signals. A transmitter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, filters and amplifies radio signals outputted from a voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and transmits the amplified radio signals through the duplexer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the antenna ANT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> modulates voice signals inputted from a microphone MIC into radio signals under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a transmission mode. Further, in a reception mode, the voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> demodulates the radio signals received from the receiver <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> into baseband voice signals, and then outputs the voice signals to a speaker SPK. In addition, the voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> records and reproduces a voice message input by the user through a voice message check process or a voice mail received from another mobile communication terminal, and outputs the reproduced voice signals to the speaker SPK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A keypad <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, having a plurality of numeric keys, generates key data corresponding to a key pressed by the user, and provides the generated key data to the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the keypad <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a Voice Memo Hot Key and a Voice Memo Select Key, or a Voice Memo Icon according to an embodiment of the present invention. A display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD), displays key data generated from the keypad <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a variety of information input from the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, under the control of the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a procedure for recording a voice memo and reproducing the recorded voice memo in a mobile communication terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a procedure for transmitting a voice message/mail recorded as a voice memo according to an embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail herein below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> description will be made of how the mobile communication terminal stores a voice message/mail and reproduces the stored voice message/mail. The user first sets Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode when he or she desires to transmit a voice message/mail using the mobile communication terminal. In the embodiment of the present invention, the users presses a Voice Memo Hot Key or a Voice Memo Icon provided on the keypad <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in order to set the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode. In a suspended state of step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> waits for the Voice Memo Hot Key or the Voice Memo Icon to be pressed/selected by the user. If the Voice Memo Hot Key is pressed by the user in step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, or if the Voice Memo Icon is selected by the user in step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enters the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode, and displays Voice Memo Record/Reproduce List on the display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. For example, the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce List includes &ldquo;1. Voice Message/Mail (.wav)&rdquo;, &ldquo;2. Voice Advertisement (.wav)&rdquo;, &ldquo;3 . Music (.wav)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;4. Voice Greetings (.wav)&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode performed in the steps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is newly implemented in the mobile communication terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention. If the user selects the Voice Memo Record Mode, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> compresses a voice message input by the user or a received voice mail into a voice file having a specific extension, and stores the voice data in the memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Reproduce Mode, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> reads a corresponding voice data-from the memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> where the compressed voice data are stored, decompresses the read voice data, temporarily stores the decompressed voice data in an internal buffer, and feeds the voice data to the voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for voice processing. The voice processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> then decodes the voice data into voice signals through voice processing, and outputs the voice signals through the speaker SPK or an earphone of the mobile communication terminal so that the user can hear the voice message. As illustrated in the step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce List displayed in the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode can include Voice Message/Mail, Voice Advertisement, Music, and/or Voice Greetings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, before transmitting the voice message/mail to another mobile communication terminal using the SVMS the user checks (or reproduces) the contents of a voice message input by the user or a voice mail received from a certain mobile communication terminal. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an item selected by the user is highlighted on the display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a bold typeface for the sake of convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> More specifically, when the user selects, for example, &ldquo;1. Voice Message/Mail (.wav)&rdquo; in step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and thereafter selects either the Voice Memo Record Mode or the Voice Memo Reproduce Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in order to record a voice memo or to check the contents of the recorded voice message/mail, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enters the selected mode. In addition, when the user selects any one of Play/Record, Pause and Stop buttons in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs a selected one of operations of steps <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. That is, if the user selects the Voice Memo Record Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Play/Record button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs voice recording in step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Reproduce Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Play/Record button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs voice reproducing in step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Record Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Pause button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> pauses voice recording in step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Reproduce Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Pause button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> pauses voice reproducing in step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Record Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Stop button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> stops voice recording in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. If the user selects the Voice Memo Reproduce Mode in step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the Stop button in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> stops voice reproducing in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the user can record a voice memo to be transmitted as a message/e-mail using the SVMS, and check the contents of the recorded voice file before transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> After checking before transmission the contents of the voice mail in the Voice Memo Record/Reproduce Mode of the steps <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the user selects a voice data to be transmitted using the SVMS on a Voice Memo List displayed on the display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> description will be made of how the mobile communication terminal transmits as a message/e-mail using the SVMS the voice data recorded and checked in the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. If the user desires to transmit the voice file created as an SVMS message in the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, he or she will select an SVMS e-mail function in the suspended mode of step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the SVMS message function can be selected by the user after the step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The &ldquo;SVMS message-function&rdquo; means both (i) a general Short message service (SMS) transmission mode of a mobile communication terminal capable of supporting SMS and (ii) a general e-mail transmission mode of a mobile communication terminal capable of supporting the wireless Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If the user selects the SVMS message function, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> recognizes the selection of the SVMS message function in step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> displays an SVMS message List on the display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. When the user selects &ldquo;2. Outgoing Message/Mailbox&rdquo; from the SVMS message list displayed in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to send a voice mail using the SVMS message function, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> recognizes the selection in step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In the step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> displays the Voice Memo List on the display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that the user can select a voice file to transmit. The remaining options listed on SVMS message list in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> will not be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The user then selects the voice data to transmit from the Voice Memo List in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, inputs a recipient (or destination) to receive the voice data, and presses a Send key. When the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> determines in step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> that the user has selected the voice data, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> waits for the recipient to be inputted by the user and the Send key to be pressed by the user. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> that the user has pressed the Send key, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> reads a corresponding voice file stored in the memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and transmits the voice data as a mail using the SVMS to the recipient&apos;s mobile communication terminal by segmenting the read voice data in a predetermined size depending on transmission capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> that the transmission of the voice data has been completed, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> determines in step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> whether the user presses an End key. If the user presses the End key in step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> ends the SVMS-based voice message/mail transmission operation according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In sum, the mobile communication terminal according to the present invention compresses not only a received voice mail but also the outgoing voice message into a voice data having a specific extension, and transmits the voice data as an SVMS mail after segmenting the voice file into a proper size. In addition, the mobile communication terminal reassembles the received segmented voice data, stores the reassembled voice data in the memory <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, decompresses the voice data into voice signals, and outputs the voice signals to the user through the speaker SPK. By doing so, it is possible to efficiently manage the memory and provide a cost-effective mail service. Further, since the mobile communication terminal compresses the voice message into a voice data with a specific extension, the voice data is compatible with the PC. In addition, by uploading the voice data-to the PC instead of storing them in the mobile communication terminal, it is possible to improve the memory efficiency of the mobile communication terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As elaborated in the foregoing description, the mobile communication terminal according to the present invention compresses a voice mail into a voice file, stores the voice data and transmits the voice file using SVMS mail, contributing to efficient memory management. In addition, since the voice mail is converted into a voice file with a specific extension, the voice file is compatible with the PC. Further, by uploading the voice files to the PC, it is possible to efficiently manage the limited memory capacity of the mobile communication terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
