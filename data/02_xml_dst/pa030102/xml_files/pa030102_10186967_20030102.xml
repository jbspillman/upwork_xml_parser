<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to wireless telecommunications, and specifically to advanced cellular telephone networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Global System for Mobile (GSM) telecommunications is used in cellular telephone networks in many countries around the world. GSM offers a useful range of network services and standards. Existing GSM networks are based on time-division multiple access (TDMA) digital communications technology. In a TDMA-based cellular network, each mobile subscriber unit communicates with only a single base station at any given time. When a subscriber moves from one cell to another, a &ldquo;hard handover&rdquo; takes place, in which the base station with which the subscriber has been communicating breaks off its link with the subscriber, and a new base station takes over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is an improved digital communications technology, which affords more efficient use of radio bandwidth than TDMA, as well as a more reliable, fade-free link between cellular telephone subscribers and base stations. The leading CDMA standard is IS-95, promulgated by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). This standard provides &ldquo;soft handover&rdquo; (or &ldquo;handoff&rdquo;) capability, wherein in moving from one cell to another, the subscriber unit is temporarily in contact with two or more base stations at the same time. This soft handover, which is made possible by the code-division approach, decreases the likelihood of a loss of connection, which can happen frequently in hard handovers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> PCT patent application PCT/US96/20764, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a wireless telecommunications system that uses a CDMA air interface (i.e., basic RF communications protocols) to implement GSM network services and protocols. Using this system, at least some of the TDMA base stations (BSSs) and subscriber units of an existing GSM network would be replaced or supplemented by corresponding CDMA equipment. CDMA BSSs in this system are adapted to communicate with GSM mobile switching centers (MSCs) via a standard GSM A-interface. The core of GSM network services is thus maintained, and the changeover from TDMA to CDMA is transparent to users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Hybrid cellular communications networks, incorporating both GSM and CDMA elements, are also described in PCT patent publications WO 95/24771 and WO 96/21999, and in an article by Tscha, et al., entitled &ldquo;A Subscriber Signaling Gateway between CDMA Mobile Station and GSM Mobile Switching Center,&rdquo; in Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Universal Personal Communications, Ottawa (1993), pp. 181-185, which are incorporated herein by reference. None of these publications deals with specific issues of how to perform efficient handovers of subscriber units between different base stations in such hybrid networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> PCT patent application PCT/US97/00926, which is also incorporated herein by reference, describes methods of intersystem handover between CDMA and TDMA BSSs in a hybrid GSM/CDMA telecommunications system. A GSM/TDMA BSS generates pilot beacon signals in accordance with CDMA technology. During a telephone call, a subscriber unit detects the pilot signals and notifies a base station controller that the signals have been detected. The subscriber unit is then handed over from the CDMA to the TDMA BSS without interrupting the call. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for use in a mixed TDMA/CDMA cellular communications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of some aspects of the present invention to provide improved methods and apparatus enabling handover of a subscriber unit between TDMA and CDMA base stations without interrupting communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a mixed GSM/CDMA cellular communications system includes both TDMA and CDMA base stations, jointly controlled by a mobile switching center (MSC). Systems of this type are described generally in the above-mentioned PCT patent applications, which are incorporated herein by reference. A subscriber unit in the system, also referred to herein as a mobile station (MS), is capable of communicating with both types of base stations, by appropriately switching between TDMA and CDMA air interfaces, while preferably using GSM network protocols over both types of interface. It is a feature of preferred embodiments of the present invention that the communications system may be based on an existing GSM/TDMA infrastructure, with the addition of CDMA BSSs, and with substantially no other modification to the existing infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to determine when a handover should take place, a MS in communication with a current base station of one type (CDMA or TDMA) monitors RF signals originating from another base station, which may be a base station of the other type (TDMA or CDMA, respectively). A message sequence between the current base station and the MS enables the MS to acquire appropriate synchronization information with regard to the new base station, and report back on this information to the current base station. The information is used by the system to enable the MS to establish an air interface with the new base station, whereupon the handover takes place without substantially interrupting communications between the MS and the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the context of the present patent application, such handovers between base stations are referred to as &ldquo;mobile-assisted handovers.&rdquo; Mobile-assisted handover is used in GSM and in CDMA systems known in the art, wherein a mobile station measures and reports on the strength of signals received from a base station transceiver in a neighboring cell before being handed over to that cell. In hybrid GSM/CDMA systems that have been proposed to date, however, mobile stations are presumed to be capable of receiving signals from either a CDMA or a TDMA base station at any given time (or a CDMA beacon associated with a TDMA base station, as in the above-mentioned PCT patent application PCT/US97/00926), but not both, and are therefore not capable of providing this type of assistance. The provision of mobile-assistance in accordance with the principles of the present invention enables handovers to be conducted more smoothly and reliably than would otherwise be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the MS switches between TDMA and CDMA operation in the course of a telephone call, according to instructions received from the base station with which the unit is in communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Before the handover is to take place, the MS receives signals from both TDMA and CDMA base stations, and reports back to the base station regarding the signals it is receiving. The information thus reported is reported back to and used by the BSC to initiate the handover. Preferably, the MS comprises a single radio transceiver, and therefore, at any given moment the MS can communicate with either the TDMA or CDMA base station, but not both. (In accordance with the principles of IS-95, however, as described hereinabove, the unit can communicate with more than one CDMA base station at once.) It is noted further that each GSM/TDMA base station has its own synchronization clock, to which the MSs in communication therewith are synchronized, while the CDMA base stations are mutually synchronized to a real time of day. Therefore, in switching between the TDMA and CDMA stations, the MS in each case acquires and synchronizes its operation to the appropriate clock signal without substantially interrupting the telephone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In some of these preferred embodiments, the MS is in communication with a CDMA base station, when it is determined that the unit may be handed over to a GSM/TDMA base station. CDMA transmission by the MS transceiver is interrupted temporarily, during which time the unit performs a GSM neighbor scan, generally in accordance with GSM standards, to acquire and synchronize to the TDMA base station. Preferably, the CDMA transmission is interrupted for a single frame, typically 20 ms long, creating an idle time slot in accordance with the IS95 standard. After the TDMA base station is identified, and suitable messages have been exchanged, a traffic channel between the base station is opened, and the MS is switched to the TDMA base station while interruption of a telephone call being conducted by the MS is substantially minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In others of these preferred embodiments, the MS is in communication with a TDMA base station, when it is determined that the unit may be handed over to a CDMA base station. In order to synchronize with the CDMA station, the MS acquires the time of day, preferably by receiving an accurate time of day from the TDMA base station, wherein the GSM network is provided with equipment necessary to generate and broadcast the time of day. Preferably, the network includes a cell broadcast system (CBS), in accordance with the GSM standard, which is used to receive the time of day, provided, for example, by the Global Positioning System (GPS) or received from one or more of the CDMA base stations, and broadcast it through the network to the MSs. Alternatively, the MS temporarily interrupts TDMA reception in order to acquire and synchronize to the time of day of the CDMA station. Thus, although a certain degradation of the signal may result from the TDMA time slot(s) lost in this fashion, the mobile-assisted handover from TDMA to CDMA is generally more reliable and less disturbing to a user of the MS than would otherwise be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiments are described herein with reference to MSs having a single transceiver for TDMA and CDMA use, it will be appreciated that the principles of the present invention may similarly be applied using subscriber units and system hardware of other types, and particularly using a subscriber unit having separate or only partially integrated TDMA and CDMA transceivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> There is therefore provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in a mobile wireless telecommunications system, which includes base stations of a first type operating according to a first air interface, and base stations of a second type operating according to a second air interface, a method for handing over a mobile station in the system from a first base station, which is of the first type, to a second base station, which is of the second type, including: </paragraph>

Preferably, receiving the data includes applying a weighting factor to the measurement of signal strength, wherein applying the weighting factor includes varying the factor according to a network condition in the system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of mobile stations (MS) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which communicate with PLMN <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via a plurality of base station subsystems (BSS) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over a wireless RF link in one or more of the accepted cellular communications frequencies. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is also known as a subscriber unit, is capable of communicating with both GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, using a substantially standard GSM TDMA signaling protocol, and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, using CDMA-based communication methods described hereinbelow. Additionally, although in standard GSM systems, mobile stations can typically receive broadcasts from CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> only in idle mode, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of receiving such broadcasts during a call through BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as will be described further hereinbelow. Although for the sake of clarity, only one each of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it will be understood that in actuality, system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> typically comprises a plurality of each of these system elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Both GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicate with and are controlled by MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Communications between GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially in accordance with GSM standards. CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is modified relative to the IS<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> CDMA standard so as to communicate with PLMN <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in accordance with GSM standards, and particularly so as to communicate with MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the GSM standard A-interface, as further described hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also communicates with CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so as to receive messages to be broadcast over the air, and comprises a radio operation and maintenance center (OMC-R) <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The OMC-R communicates with NMC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> over a GSM-standard Q3 interface, preferably using an information model based on the GSM 12.XX series of specifications, which are incorporated herein by reference. Optionally, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be linked to a general packet data service (GPRS) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as has been proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Alternatively or additionally, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be coupled for transmission of packet data directly to PSTN/PDN <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (although such a connection is, for the sake of simplicity, not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), preferably with a link to the Internet therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Communications between CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are built on a CDMA &ldquo;air interface,&rdquo; which is preferably generally in accordance with the IS<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> standard for CDMA communications. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is built around a base station controller (BSC) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which controls and communicates with a number of base station transceivers (BTS) <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Each BTS transmits RF signals to and receives RF signals from MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the MS is within a geographical area, or cell, served by the particular BTS. When during a telephone call, the MS moves from the cell of one CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to another, a &ldquo;soft handover&rdquo; (or handoff) between the BTSs takes place, as is known in the CDMA art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> There may also be regions of service of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, however, which do not have CDMA coverage (i.e., there is no CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in such a region), or in which coverage is weak or congested. If MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves into such a region during a telephone call, the MS is handed over from the CDMA BTS to a BTS associated with GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without interrupting the call. Similarly, if MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves from a region served only by GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the cell of CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> during a call, the MS is preferably handed over from the GSM to the CDMA BSS. Methods for performing such handovers between CDMA and GSM/TDMA service and vice versa, as well as between one CMDA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and another, are described further hereinbelow. By virtue of such methods and of the architecture of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the benefits of CDMA service in those regions served by system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which the service has been implemented, without losing service in TDMA regions. Transitions between CDMA and TDMA regions are substantially transparent to users of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, because higher-level GSM network protocols are observed throughout the system, and only the lower-level RF air interface is changed during the transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a block diagram that schematically illustrates communications protocol stacks between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSSs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> communicates with GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over a GSM Um interface, which is based on a standard TDMA air interface, so that substantially no modification is required to BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or to GSM Layer 1 and Layer 2 standard interface protocols in order to accommodate MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> communicates with CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over a CDMA Um interface, based on a CDMA IS-95 air interface with certain modifications. Subscriber units known in the art are capable of operating over either a GSM Um or a CDMA Um interface, but not both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In order to sustain both of these interfaces, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises mobile equipment (ME) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which must include either two radio transceivers, one configured for TDMA operation and one for CDMA, or a single transceiver which can dynamically switch between TDMA and CDMA. The ME includes mobile termination (MT), which supports terminal equipment (TE) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for voice and/or data input and output. In addition, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a subscriber identity module (SIM) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, in accordance with GSM standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram illustrating MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprising a single radio transceiver in ME <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is built around a modem unit <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, including a DSP core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> capable of generating and processing both TDMA and CDMA signals. Preferably, core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises an ASIC device, including stand-alone CDMA transmission/reception processing, which is supported by GSM timing logic <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a GSM hardware accelerator (or DSP) <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as well as having a port for SIM <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives input and delivers output to TE <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In this case, TE <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is represented as an audio microphone and speaker, and core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> performs D/A and A/D conversion, as well as vocoding functions on the audio signals, as are known in the art. Either GSM or CDMA vocoding is applied, depending on whether MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in contact with GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may, additionally or alternatively, be configured to work with TE <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> providing digital data input/output, such as a fax device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> outputs digital data, which may be in either TDMA or CDMA format, to a mixed-signal output device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> processes and converts the data to analog baseband form, for input to RF transmitter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A duplexer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> conveys the resultant RF signals via antenna to the GSM or CDMA base station, as appropriate. Signals received from the base station are passed by duplexer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through an RF receiver <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a mixed-signal input device <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which performs baseband conversion and AGC functions, to core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Preferably, transmitter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, receiver <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and mixed-signal devices <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are controlled by core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> RF transmission and reception by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are preferably at frequencies in the GSM 900 or 1800 MHz band, for compatibility with existing GSM equipment, particularly BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Assuming that MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes only the single transceiver shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, operating in the GSM band, CDMA equipment in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be appropriately configured to operate in this frequency range, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, whether MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> physically includes one transceiver or two, it must support dual air interface Layers 1 and 2 in its protocol stack, for operation vis-a-vis GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively. The CDMA air interface between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises CDMA Layer 1 , which operates on a standard IS-95 protocol, and GSM-CDMA Layer 2 , in which IS-95 operation is modified to accommodate the needs of GSM network services. GSM-CDMA Layer 2 includes functionality, such as message ordering, priority and fragmentation, and suspension and resumption of communications, which is normally supported by the standard GSM Layer 2 , but not by CDMA IS-95. Vis-a-vis GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, air interface Layers 1 and 2 are in accordance with GSM standards, substantially without modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Standard GSM protocols include a third Radio Interface Layer (RIL3), including three sub-layers, above GSM Layer 1 and Layer 2 . The lowest of these three RIL3 sub-layers is a Radio Resource (RR) management layer, which supports Mobile Management (MM) and Connection Management (CM) sub-layers above it. The RIL3 sub-layers in GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are substantially unchanged with respect to the GSM standard, and the GSM MM and CM sub-layers are likewise maintained substantially without change in MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The CM sub-layer supports signaling for call processing, as well as GSM supplementary services and short message service (SMS). The MM sub-layer supports signaling required for locating MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, authentication and encryption key management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In order to support the MM and CM sub-layers, a GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer is introduced in the MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> protocol stacks. The GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer, which manages radio resources and maintains radio links between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSSs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of the existence of the dual GSM and CDMA lower layers (Layers 1 and 2) in the MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> protocol stack. It invokes the appropriate lower layers in the MS stack to communicate with either the standard RIL3-RR sub-layer of BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over the GSM Um interface or the GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer of BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over the CDMA Um interface, depending on instructions it receives from the BSS with which it is in communication. The MM and CM sub-layers are not processed by BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, but are rather relayed through between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for processing in a manner substantially transparent to the CDMA air interface layers below. The RR sub-layer in the MS stack also controls the handover between the corresponding air interfaces defined in Layers 1 and 2 and assists in cell selection for the handover, under instructions from MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the BSSs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Regardless of which of the air interfaces is in use, the GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer supports the standard GSM RIL3-MM and CM sub-layers above it. The RR sub-layer preferably offers complete radio resource management functionality as defined by GSM specifications 04.07 and 04.08, which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Although a &ldquo;RR&rdquo; layer per se is not defined by the CDMA IS-95 standard, the GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer described herein maintains full IS-95 radio resource functionality, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In accordance with GSM standards, the functionality of the RR sub-layer includes both idle mode operation and dedicated mode services (i.e., services performed during a telephone conversation). The idle mode operation of the RR sub-layer includes automatic cell selection and idle handover between GSM and CDMA cells, as well as between pairs of CDMA cells and pairs of GSM cells, with cell change indication as specified by the GSM standard. The RR sub-layer in idle mode also performs broadcast channel processing, as specified by GSM and CDMA standards, and establishment of RR connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In dedicated mode, the RR sub-layer performs the following services: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Routing services, service request, transfer of messages, and substantially all other functions specified by GSM standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Change of dedicated channels (handover), including hard handovers as described hereinbelow and CDMA-to-CDMA soft and &ldquo;softer&rdquo; handovers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Mode settings for the RR channel, including transmission mode, type of channel and coding/decoding/transcoding mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> MS parameters management based on IS-95 specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> MS classmark management based on GSM specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the above features of the RR sub-layer are listed only by way of a summary, and that additional details and features may be added based on published GSM and CDMA specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a block diagram that schematically illustrates protocol stacks used in signaling interfaces between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. These interfaces enable MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to communicate with GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> over a CDMA air interface. Operation of these interfaces, and particularly message flow through these interfaces, is described in greater detail in the above-mentioned PCT patent application PCT/US96/20764 and incorporated herein by reference. When MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in communication with MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the protocol stacks are in accordance with GSM standards, substantially without modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As noted hereinabove, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> exchanges signals with CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over the CDMA Um interface, wherein the MS and BSS protocol stacks are modified to include the GSM-CDMA RR sub-layer and Layer 2 . In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> relay layer is shown explicitly in the BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> protocol stack, for conveying RIL3-CM and MM signaling between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, largely without processing by BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Other layers involved in the Um interface were described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> over a standard, substantially unmodified GSM A-interface. This interface is based on the GSM SS7 and BSS Application Part (BSSAP) protocols, as are known in the art, preferably in accordance with the GSM 08.08 standard. BSSAP supports procedures between MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that require interpretation and processing of information related to single calls and resource management, as well as transfer of call control and mobility management messages between MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> translates CDMA Layer 1 and GSM-CDMA Layer 2 and RR protocols exchanged between the BSS and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into appropriate SS7 and BSSAP protocols for transmission to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Because CDMA BSC <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> communicates with GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> using the standard A-interface, substantially no modifications are required in the core GSM MSC in order to enable the addition of CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to GSM system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> need not be aware that there is any difference in identity between GSM/TDMA BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, since both communicate with the MSC in a substantially identical manner over the A-interface. Preferably, cells associated with BTSs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are mapped by MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in substantially the same manner as GSM/TDMA cells, and are thus assigned GSM absolute radio frequency channel number (ARFCN) and base station identity code (BSIC) values, in accordance with the GSM standard. From the point of view of MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a handover between GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or even between two different CDMA BSSs, is no different from a handover between two GSM </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> BSSs in a conventional GSM/TDMA-based system. The BSIC of the CDMA cells is assigned so as to be distinguishable within system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from conventional GSM cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a block diagram that schematically illustrates protocol stacks involved in conveying voice data between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Voice data between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are coded and decoded by a CDMA vocoder, which may comprise any of the standard IS-95 vocoder protocols known in the art. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> translates CDMA Layer 1 into GSM E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> TDMA signals, and converts the CDMA vocoded data into PCM A-law companded voice data, in accordance with the requirements of the A-interface standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thus transmits and receives voice data to and from MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> substantially without regard to the fact that the data between the BSS and the MS are CDMA-encoded, as though MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> were operating in GSM/TDMA mode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram showing details of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, useful in understanding a method for mobile-assisted handover of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Unlike <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown here in detail to include a BSC <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and a plurality of BTSs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> illustrates the handover of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from one of the BTSs associated with BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, labeled here BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, to BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also includes GSM-CDMA BSC <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and BTSs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The handover from CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to TDMA BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is preferably initiated by BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when it is determined that MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in a location in which such a handover might be desirable. This situation may arise when the signal received from BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is weak, or when MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is known to be reaching the edge of a CDMA coverage area, or when traffic on CDMA channels is heavy. Alternatively, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may instruct MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to seek a signal from BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (or other GSM BTSs) from time to time independently of any specific pressure to do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a schematic signal flow diagram, illustrating signals conveyed between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, BSSs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the handover process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. BSC <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> instructs MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to begin a gated search for neighboring GSM BTSs, wherein for brief periods, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> interrupts its communications with BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to search for and receive TDMA signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Preferably, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operating on the IS<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> standard, which enables CDMA transmission to be idle for the duration of a 20 ms frame, during which the GSM TDMA neighbor scan can take place without substantially interrupting CDMA voice communications. Most preferably, transmission by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during the 20 ms frame is suspended using an activation/deactivation mechanism as defined by the IS-95B standard, section 6.6.6.2.8. Alternatively, such an idle period may also be introduced under other CDMA standards, as well. Further alternatively, as noted hereinabove, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may comprise separate TDMA and CDMA transceivers that can be used simultaneously for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Preferably, BSC <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provides MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a list of the frequencies of neighboring GSM TDMA cells, such as those associated with BTSs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Such a list is useful in reducing the time needed to search for and find BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, since MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will search only at the frequencies of the cells on the list. The list is updated as MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves from one cell to another and is maintained during handovers between TDMA and CDMA base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> When MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives a signal at the frequency of BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, it attempts to decode the GSM frequency correction (FCCH) and synchronization (SCH) channels in the signal. This decoding may take several of the gated CDMA idle periods to complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Once decoding is successfully accomplished, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> determines the power level of the TDMA signal and reports it to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> together with the GSM cell identity. To determine the power level, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably averages the signal power over a period, so as to reduce the influence of MS movement and channel fading. The determination and reporting of the TDMA power level is preferably repeated continually after MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has received the command to do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In accordance with GSM standards, the power level for each cell monitored by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> should be determined at least once every 5 sec, and the corresponding SCH should be decoded at least once every 30 sec. The power levels should be determined for all of the cells on the list of neighboring cells provided by BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the MS decodes the SCH and reports the power level only of the cell from which the best signal was received. Most preferably, the MS reports to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> only when there has been a change in the determined power level since the last report or some other change of significance in the signals received by the MS from the monitored cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Based on this information, the BSS determines whether and when a handover is to take place. At an appropriate time, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> initiates a handover request to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The MSC conveys the handover request to GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which acknowledges the request. GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then conveys a RR handover command via MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a new traffic channel (TCH) is opened between BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the MS. At this point the handover is complete, and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> switches over to BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. A successful handover is reported to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, substantially in accordance with GSM messaging standards, following which the MSC issues a suitable &ldquo;clear&rdquo; command to CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which responds with a &ldquo;clear complete&rdquo; message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the new traffic channel is opened in a non-synchronized handover mode, in accordance with accepted GSM handover methods, and GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is configured to accept such a handover. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably responds to the RR handover command with a handover access burst on the main dedicated control channel (DCCH) of GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the handover command. The MS then waits to receive an appropriate physical information message from BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the TCH, as defined in GSM standard 04.08, in order to complete the handover. If the physical information is not received within a predetermined time period, preferably within 320 ms, in accordance with the T3124 timer of the IS-95 standard, the MS attempts to resume its connection to CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The decision to initiate the handover may take place whenever the signal from GSM BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> becomes stronger than that of CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, but preferably other criteria are applied. For example, since CDMA channels typically offer better transmission quality than GSM channels, the handover is preferably initiated only when the GSM signal is stronger than the CDMA signal by some predetermined weighting factor. The factor may be preprogrammed in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or it may be set by a user of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It may also be adjusted dynamically in response to such parameters as the geographical location of the MS and the relative amounts of traffic on the CDMA and TDMA channels in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</cross-reference> are block diagrams that schematically illustrate the structure of IS-95B frames <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, used respectively by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to decode and monitor the power of TDMA cells, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Monitoring frames <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> are interspersed with normal CDMA communication frames <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, at a repetition rate of no more than one monitoring frame in 480 ms. IS-95B standards allow the monitoring frames to have a duration of either 20 ms or 40 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Longer monitoring periods may be used if desired. The choice of shorter (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ms) frames decreases possible data loss in a CDMA call being conducted simultaneously between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, although it increases the length of time needed to complete a cycle of decoding and monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> illustrates monitoring frame <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, which is used to acquire the FCCH and SCH of a particular TDMA cell of interest. In an initial interval <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> adjusts its receiver frequency, typically by adjusting an appropriate phase-locked loop (PLL) to the frequency of the TDMA cell. In a subsequent interval <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the MS adjusts its receiver gain for the signal being received from the TDMA cell, typically using automatic gain control (AGC). Suitable methods of PLL and AGC adjustment are well known in the art. Intervals <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>-are preferably about 1 ms each in duration. Subsequently, for about 15 or 35 ms, depending on whether the total duration of frame <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is 20 or 40 ms, the FCCH and SCH of the acquired TDMA cell are decoded, as described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Then, in preparation for the next CDMA frame <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> readjusts its frequency to its previous (CDMA) setting and then resynchronizes to CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in a final interval <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> illustrates monitoring frame <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, which is used to measure power levels of TDMA cells of interest. For each such cell, the frequency of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is adjusted in an initial interval <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, as described above. The cell power level is then determined during a corresponding energy measurement interval <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, preferably having a duration of about 1.4 ms. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, the duration of frame <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is taken to be 20 ms, enabling power levels to be determined for seven different cells during the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, if a 40 ms frame is used, the power levels of up to 15 different cells may be determined during the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment not shown in the figures, one monitoring frame may be divided into two or more parts, one for acquiring the FCCH and SCH, and the other for energy measurements. Further alternative embodiments may be based on the IS-95C or IS-95Q CDMA standard. </paragraph>

Solid lines in these figures represent processes carried out using IS-95 gating, as described hereinabove, so that the MS switches between CDMA and TDMA reception. Dashed lines indicate alternative state transitions that are possible when the MS is capable of simultaneous CDMA/TDMA operation, typically requiring that the MS have dual radio transceivers (unlike the single-transceiver MS shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). The states of GSM-TDMA BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not shown, since they are substantially in accordance with GSM standards, which are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Certain messages conveyed between MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the course of the handover processes are indicated along the lines connecting relevant states of BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the figures. These messages preferably have the general form of standard IS-95 or GSM messages, as appropriate, which are modified and/or supplemented so as to carry additional information that needs to be conveyed in hybrid GSM-CDMA system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Although certain exemplary messages and message formats are described herein, substantially any suitable assignment of the message fields may be used, within the constraints of the relevant IS-95 and GSM standards, as will be clear to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> At the start of the handover process, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in communication with BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> over a CDMA traffic channel (TCH) in a state <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the MS and a state <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the BSS. The BSS issues a search gating command, including gating parameters, and then waits for gating completion in a state <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> checks the parameters in a state <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. If the MS is not configured to support the parameters, it issues a gating reject message. If the parameters are supported, the MS issues a gating complete message and enters an IS-95 gating state <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. If a stop gating command is received, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> returns to state <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the gating complete message, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enters an IS-95 gating state <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and commands MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to start monitoring neighboring cells. (As noted above, gating states <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are not needed if the MS is capable of simultaneous CDMA/TDMA operation, in which case the MS enters state <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> directly from state <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.) The BSS then enters a state <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in which it waits for the monitoring to be completed. The MS checks the monitoring command parameters in a state <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Having verified that it does support the monitoring command parameters, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enters a GSM monitoring state <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, in which it periodically decodes and determines the signal strength of the neighboring cells, as described hereinabove. Likewise, upon receiving confirmation from the MS that it has begun monitoring neighboring cells, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enters a respective GSM monitoring state <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> continues monitoring the neighboring cells and reporting the results to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the form of a pilot strength measurement message (PSMM). When a handover trigger condition is established, i.e., when the signal received by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is sufficiently weaker than one of the neighboring cells, the BSS indicates to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that a handover is required and enters a waiting state <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. If no handover command is received within a predefined period, preferably determined by GSM timer T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the GSM standard, the BSS returns to state <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. When the handover command is received from the MSC, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes the RIL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-RR handover command on to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and then enters another waiting state <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, where it awaits a Layer 2 (L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) acknowledgment of the command from the MS. It is noted that BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also receive a handover command while in state <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, in which case it similarly issues the RIL3-RR handover command to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and enters state <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> When MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the RIL3-RR handover command, it checks the handover command parameters in a state <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> supports the handover command parameters, it sends the L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> acknowledgment to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and enters a CDMA suspension state <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. If the parameters are not supported, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> issues a handover failure message and returns to state <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In this case, or if no acknowledgment is received within a predefined period, preferably determined by GSM timer T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sends a handover failure message to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and returns to state <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the parameters are supported, and that the handover command indicates that the MS is to be handed over to GSM-TDMA BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the MS sends the handover access message and then waits in a state <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for the physical information from BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. (If the handover command specifies that the MS is to be handed over to another CDMA BSS, the MS enters a state <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, as described further hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>.) Meanwhile, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> awaits a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; command in a state <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, while periodically sending &ldquo;clear request&rdquo; messages to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Once the physical information has been received, the handover is successfully completed, and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enters a GSM traffic channel communications state <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receives the clear command, whereupon it enters a state <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, in which it releases air resources allocated to the communication channel with MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and sends a &ldquo;clear complete&rdquo; message. The BSS enters a SCCP release state <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in which it releases call resources used in communicating with MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and then ends its connection with MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in an end state <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> If MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> does not receive the physical information within a specified period, however, given by expiration of the GSM T3124 timer, the MS enters a state <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in which it attempts to reacquire CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and return to state <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A handover failure message is issued to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which then enters a corresponding CDMA reacquisition state <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. If reacquisition is unsuccessful, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> issues a clear request and returns to state <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, from which it may ultimately exit to state <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, as described above. The MS transfers to an idle state <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TDMA To CDMA Base Station Handover </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram showing signal flow in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) associated with providing the time of day to relevant GSM BSCs and BTSs in the system, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Ordinarily, GSM BSSs in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would not be informed of the time of day, since this information is not required by the GSM standard. On the other hand, the IS-95 standard requires that CDMA base stations be synchronized, since such synchronization is necessary for identification and decoding of the signals and for soft handover between cells. Therefore, for mobile-assisted handover of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from TDMA BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to CDMA <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, but with the direction of the handover arrow reversed), it is necessary that the time of day be provided by system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> allows the time of day to be provided in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without the necessity of hardware or software changes in MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or in GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or BTSs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, by using CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is a standard part of PLMN <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to broadcast the time of day over the system. Ordinary, CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides a cell broadcast service (CBS) in accordance with GSM interface standards 03.41 and 03.49, enabling general short messages to be broadcast unacknowledged to defined geographical areas within system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The messages are received by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while it is in standby, or idle, mode, i.e., when the MS is not involved in a telephone call. For the purpose of providing time of day information, however, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably capable of receiving CBS messages not only when it is in an idle mode, as prescribed by GSM standards, but also when the MS is in a dedicated mode, i.e., during a telephone call (although at the possible expense of losing data from the call itself). The use of the CBS to provide time-of-day information to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is desirable particularly when the MS includes only a single radio transmitter and receiver, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>; when dual radios are used, one for CDMA and the other for TDMA, the CDMA radio can receive the time of day while the TDMA radio is in use in a telephone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, CBS messages are also used to initiate a search by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for neighboring cells, as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> A special MS <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which is equipped with a GPS (global positioning system) receiver <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, is located in one or more of the GSM/TDMA cells of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which the time of day is needed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, MS <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> receives the time of day from receiver <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and associates the time with an identification of the concurrent TDMA frame number, based on synchronization signals transmitted by BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the GSM standard. Alternatively, MS <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be configured to receive the time of day from a CDMA BSS, in which case GPS receiver <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is not required. MS <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> opens a data call via BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, BSC <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and PSTN/PDN <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and sends to the CBC the cell identification and correspondence of the current time of day and frame number. Alternatively, MS <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may convey the information by any other suitable method, such as using the GSM SMS. CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> then transmits this information over the CBS to the cell, so that MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the time of day even when it is operating in GSM/TDMA mode. Therefore, when MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be handed over to CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, there is no need to acquire synchronization/time of day information from the CDMA BTS, and the handover can proceed more rapidly and smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Introducing the time of day into system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also has benefits for the GSM portion of the system in itself, without connection to CDMA handover. For example, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can transmit its time of day to different GSM BTSs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the timing delay from the MS to each of the BTSs can be measured and used to determine the location of the MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a schematic map of overlapping GSM/TDMA cells <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and CDMA cells <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, illustrating aspects of mobile-assisted handover from GSM BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An operator of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will recognize that when MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located in any of cells <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> TDMA/CDMA handover may take place. Therefore, CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will broadcast a CBS message to all dual-mode (GSM/CDMA) MSs in these cells, including the following information and instructions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> MS to begin search for CDMA signals (search trigger). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Frequencies of CDMA BTSs in overlapping and neighboring cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> GSM mapping of CDMA cells <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, according to GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Identification of the time of day with the current TDMA frame number, preferably as derived from MS <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, although other methods may also be used to supply the time of day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the factor by which the CDMA signal strength is to be multiplied for comparison with the TDMA signal, as described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> There is no need for such a message to be broadcast in cells <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it will be understood that only the dual-mode MSs are programmed to receive and interpret this message, while ordinary GSM/TDMA MSs will ignore it. The CBS message triggers and enables the dual-mode MSs to gather and provide information to GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for assistance in making the handover to one of the CDMA BSSs, unlike hybrid GSM/CDMA systems that have been suggested in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating signal flow in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> associated with a mobile-assisted handover from BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As noted above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the handover begins with the transmission of the search trigger and other information. The search trigger is transmitted periodically by BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> whenever MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in one of GSM cells <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), or in response to some other preprogrammed condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the trigger, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> switches off its TDMA traffic with BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and tunes its receiver to an appropriate CDMA frequency for a short period, preferably for about 5 ms. Then, after the MS has resumed communicating with BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, it attempts to decode any CDMA signal it received in order to identify a pilot beam of the BTS whose transmission it has received, say from BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As noted above, CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is mapped in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as though it were a GSM-TDMA BTS. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> therefore transmits a report message back to GSM BTS <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> indicating the power of the signal it received from BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (optionally multiplied by the relative CDMA/TDMA weighting factor mentioned above), together with the GSM system map identification of BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. From the point of view of GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, there is no substantial difference between the message transmitted by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this case and the message that would be transmitted as the result of an ordinary GSM neighbor scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> This process of measurement and reporting goes on until BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> determines that MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> should be handed over to BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. At this point, BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> conveys a message to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> indicating that the handover is required. MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes a handover request on to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which sends an acknowledgment back via MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allocates hardware and software resources to the communications traffic channel to be opened with MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and begins sending null data to the MS in order to open the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then gives a handover command to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, preferably a RIL3-RR command that encapsulates IS-95 parameters required for opening a CDMA traffic channel with CDMA BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The parameters contained in such a message are described further hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>A-D. The new traffic channel is then opened, completing the handover, and BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> releases the old TDMA traffic channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The process described above thus allows mobile-assisted handover from GSM/TDMA BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with high speed and reliability, and with minimal interruption to service in the middle of a call during which the handover takes place. For the purposes of this handover, GSM cells in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receive time of day information, and the CDMA cells are mapped into the GSM system, at minimal hardware expense and substantially without the necessity of reprogramming existing GSM system elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> A similar TDMA-CDMA handover process may be carried out even in the absence of time-of-day information at GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this case, after MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has acquired a pilot channel signal associated with BTS <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, it must tune in to and decode the CDMA sync channel of the BTS in order to derive the time of day. This operation takes about 480 ms, creating a noticeable but still tolerable interruption in voice service during a call. Further alternatively, a similar handover process can be performed using a MS having two transceivers, one for TDMA and the other for CDMA, as described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A, 10B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are flow charts that schematically illustrate, in the form of state machines, the operation of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in performing the handover illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>

BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> operates substantially in accordance with GSM standards, as are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> begins in an initial state <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, in which the MS is in communication with BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in a certain cell associated with the BSS, over a GSM traffic channel (TCH). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> When the MS moves into a new cell, it enters a state <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in which it receives and reads messages from CBC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If there is no CBC message preparing MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for possible handover to a CDMA BSS (because there is no CDMA BSS in the area, for example), the MS returns to a GSM TCH state <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, from which it may be handed over to another GSM-TDMA BSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> When prompted by an appropriate CBC message, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enters an overlay state <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, in which it acquires the time of day, as described above, and sends pilot strength measurement messages (PSMM) to BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In standard GSM-TDMA operation, there is generally a free time slot of 6 ms available once every 120 ms. During these free time slots, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> interrupts TDMA transmission to search for pilot beams of neighboring GSM-CDMA cells, such as those associated with BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If no pilot is found, the MS goes to a state <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, in which it adjusts its frequency and attempts to find an appropriate GSM frequency correction channel (FCCH). Alternatively, when a pilot is found, the MS enters a state <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, in which it adjusts its frequency as required and measures the CDMA signal strength. During subsequent slots, while MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is communicating over its current GSM-TDMA traffic channel, it attempts to decode the CDMA pilot so as to identify the cell with which the pilot is associated. The results are reported to BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> At an appropriate time, based on the results reported by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as described above, MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> conveys the handover request to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The BSS enters a preparatory state <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, in which it allocates resources, assigns a long code and makes an SCCP connection with the MSC in preparation for handover. After sending the appropriate acknowledgment message to the MSC, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enters a state <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> in which it sends null forward traffic frames to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and waits to receive reverse traffic from the MS. If the BSS fails to allocate the resources, however, it reports a handover failure and exits to an end state <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Based on parameters encapsulated in the acknowledgment message from BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the RIL3-RR handover command message is sent from GSM-TDMA BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, identifying the GSM-CDMA destination cell associated with BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and conveying the necessary handover parameters. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enters a state <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> in which it verifies that the handover parameters are supported and, if the verification succeeds, suspends its GSM-TDMA operation in a state <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. (If the verification fails, the MS reports the failure and returns to state <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>.) The MS then enters a state <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> in which it waits to receive a predetermined number of &ldquo;good&rdquo; frames, preferably the number determined by the IS-95 counter N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m</italic></highlight>, from BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the good frames have been received, the MS sends back to the BSS a number of preamble frames (short, dummy frames used in establishing the traffic channel), as specified by the NUM_PREAMBLE parameter in the handover command message, and enters a service option adjustment state <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects the preamble frames and reports to the MSC that the CDMA traffic channel has been established, after which the BSS enters a state <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> in which it waits for completion of the handover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> If MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are unable to establish communications, the handover to BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is aborted, and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> return to their earlier states. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attempts to reacquire GSM BSS <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a state <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and, if successful, returns to GSM TCH state <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. If the reacquisition fails, the MS exits to an idle mode <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>. In either case, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receives a clear command, and releases all resources it had allocated to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a state <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight>, following which BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> exits to end state <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Assuming the handover is successfully completed, however, BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enters a service option adjustment state <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, corresponding to state <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A service request is issued by BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the BSS awaits a service response from MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a waiting state <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. When the service response is received, MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> enter respective CDMA traffic channel (TCH) states <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, and the call continues normally over the CDMA channel. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram illustrating handover between two different CDMA BSSs <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> within system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> comprises a BSC <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a plurality of BTSs <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>; and BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> comprises a BSC <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a plurality of BTSs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. BSSs <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are substantially similar to and interchangeable with BSS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and described hereinabove, and communicate with GSM MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the GSM A-interface. MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown in the figure in the midst of a handover from BTS <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to BTS <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, under the control of MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Although the handover takes place between two CDMA BSSs, from the point of view of the system, it is a handover between two GSM BSSs, wherein BTSs <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are respectively mapped by MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as GSM cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating signal flow between the elements of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> in the course of the handover, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Prior to initiating the handover, BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> issues a search trigger to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which then searches for CDMA transmission frequencies of neighboring cells, preferably using IS-95 gating, substantially as described hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The handover is triggered when MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reports to BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that it is receiving a signal from BTS <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with a higher power level than that of BTS <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the report from MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends a handover-required message to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, specifying the GSM cell identity of BTS <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as the new cell assignment desired for the handover. The message is generally in accordance with GSM standards. The CDMA data rate of communications between the MS and the BSS, which according to IS-95 standards can be either 8 kbit/sec (rate set <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or 14.4 kbit/sec (rate set <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), is preferably conveyed in the message by indicating the IS-95 data rates respectively as GSM half-rate and full-rate traffic channels. When the GSM traffic channel rate is conveyed to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the BSS interprets the rate to select the appropriate IS-95 data rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sends a handover request to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, which responds by sending to the MSC an acknowledgment that encapsulates a RIL3-RR handover command message, which is passed back to BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Thus, all of the messages sent between BSSs <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> comply with A-interface requirements, and CDMA parameters associated with IS95 are mapped to corresponding GSM parameters, for example, identification of vocoder type 13K QCELP in CDMA to GSM full rate vocoder. The handover request, acknowledge and command are passed on by MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> substantially without change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> After receiving the handover command, old BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends the RR handover command message to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to effect the handover to new BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The message to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> encapsulates CDMA parameters required for the handover, in accordance with IS-95 standards, including but not limited to the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> A new long code mask, preferably allocated by BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> from a pool of available numbers, in such a manner that mask values used in a common coverage area are as distant as possible from one another and that no two MSs in the area have the same mask. An exemplary scheme of long code mask allocation is described below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A-D. Although in standard IS-95 cellular systems, the long code mask of the MS is fixed and is conveyed to the new BS in the course of the handover, GSM standards do not provide a message that can be used to convey the long code mask to new BS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. It is therefore necessary for BS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to allocate the new long code mask and pass it back to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via BS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, preferably in the RR handover command, as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Nominal power level parameters, preferably NOM_PWR and NOM_PWR_EXT, as specified by IS-95 standards, providing a correction factor to be used by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in open-loop power estimation, by means of which the MS sets the power level of signals to be transmitted to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Frame offset, a parameter that indicates, preferably in steps of 1.25 ms, a delay of forward and reverse traffic channel frames sent to and received from MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, relative to system timing of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The frame offset is passed from BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in the handover command message. An optional ACTIVE_TIME parameter may also be included to indicate the time at which the delay is to be introduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Code channel, similarly passed from BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, to indicate a Walsh function that is to be used to encode the forward traffic channel from BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the IS-95 standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Layer 2 acknowledgment numbering, which may be used by BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to reset acknowledgment processing by protocol layer 2 in MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, preferably at a time specified in the handover command message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Forward traffic channel power control parameters, used by BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to reset the TOT_FRAMES and BAD_FRAMES counts made by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the purpose of reporting forward channel error statistics to the BSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Number of preamble, indicating the number of preamble frames to be transmitted by MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> after the MS has received N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>good frames from the BSS, as described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The parameters listed above are not exhaustive and are intended only as a representative sample of the information to be conveyed in the handover command message. Other IS-95 parameters may similarly be included in the message. More generally, those skilled in the art will understand how the method exemplified by the handover command described above, wherein data associated with one of the air interfaces in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (GSM/TDMA or CDMA) are conveyed in messages sent over the other one of the air interfaces, can be used in a similar manner to convey messages and data of other types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> After the RR handover command has been sent to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a new traffic channel is established between BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. To establish the channel, BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> sends traffic channel frames to MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which responds with an appropriate number of preamble frames, as specified by the handover command message. A successful handover is then reported to MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, substantially in accordance with GSM messaging standards, following which the MSC issues a suitable &ldquo;clear&rdquo; command to old BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which responds with a &ldquo;clear complete&rdquo; message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A-D are block diagrams that schematically illustrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-bit long code masks allocated by BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with the handover illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> shows a mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for use in an access channel; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> shows a mask <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for use in a paging channel; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference> shows a mask <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for use in fundamental (forward and reverse) traffic channels; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</cross-reference> shows a mask <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> for use in supplementary (forward and reverse) traffic channels. Such supplementary channels are used, for example, in multi-channel medium data rate (MDR) communications, as specified by the IS-95B standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Access channel mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an access channel number <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, a paging channel number <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a base station identification number (ID) <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and a pilot beam offset <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, all of which are assigned substantially in accordance with IS-95 specifications. The paging channel number and pilot beam offset are similarly included in paging channel mask <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Traffic channel masks <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> represent public long code mask formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> They preferably include base station ID <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and a unique, 16-bit number <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> chosen from a pool assigned to BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Pool number <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is assigned, as described hereinabove, so that no two MSs can have the same long code mask. For greater call security, a private long code mask may be used in place of masks <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Generation of such masks, using a GSM encryption code Kc, is described, for example, in a patent application entitled, &ldquo;Encryption Support in a Hybrid GSM/CDMA Network,&rdquo; filed Oct. 21, 1998, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Operation of BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in carrying out the handover shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> can be represented schematically by state machines substantially similar to those illustrated respectively by FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A/<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Operation of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this handover is largely similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, up to state <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, at which CDMA communications with BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are suspended. As MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is establishing a new traffic channel with CDMA BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, it passes through states <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which are equivalent to states <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, respectively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. If MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> fails to acquire the new traffic channel while it is in state <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, it passes to state <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, in which it attempts to reacquire old BSS <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The method described hereinabove relates primarily to hard handovers between two different BSSs <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, under the control of MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably also allows soft handovers of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in accordance with IS-95 standards, between BTSs associated with a single BSC, such as BTSs <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Optionally, if BSC <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is suitably linked to BSC <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, by a connection generally independent of MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (not shown in the figures), a soft inter-BSS handover from BTS <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to BTS <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may also take place. In such cases, BSS <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> informs MSC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that the handover has taken place, so that the new location of MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is appropriately registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> One of the problems that exists when attempting to measure the amount of power that is being transmitted from a GSM system is that the timing of the GSM system must be determined. For example, when attempting to perform a handover from a system using a CDMA Multicarrier (MC) air interface, such as is provided for in third generation CDMA systems, commonly known as &ldquo;3G&rdquo; systems, to a GSM system, such as a GSM system, the timing of the GSM system must be determined before power measurements can be made and reported. One reason for this is that due to the frequency reuse schemes used in GSM, it is necessary for the MS making measurements to be able to read the Sychronization Channel during the time at which a Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) is being transmitted. Such BSICs are transmitted roughtly every 10 GSM frames (about every 46 milliseconds). In accordance with GSM industry standard requirements, the MS must report the BSIC together with the measured average power level (RXLEV) for each GSM signal that is to be measured. One way in which the timing can be determined is by providing information to the MS <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from a MC base station (MC-BS), including the GSM Frame Number, which uniquely identifies the instant in time when the Synchronization Channel is transmitted by a GSM-BSS. It should be noted that the frame number that is valid at a particular time in one GSM-BSS is not the same as the number that is valid at any other GSM-BSS of the same system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> This is intentionally done in order to allow GSM MSs to monitor neighboring cells during TDMA idle periods. Therefore, at any instant in time the GSM Frame Number is different in each GSM-BSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the presently disclosed method and apparatus, the information that is provided includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> (1) CDMA time, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> (2) an indication of the number of GSM channels that are to be searched, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> (3) a received signal strength threshold, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> (4) information relevant to each of the channels to be searched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the disclosed method and apparatus, the information that is relevant to each of the channels includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> (1) the frequency band that includes the channel to be searched, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> (2) the frequency of the channel to be searched (such as the &ldquo;AFRCN&rdquo; defined in the industry standard related to GSM communication systems), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> (3) an identification code associated with the channel (such as the Base Station Identification Code (BSIC) defined in the industry standard related to GSM communication systems), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> (4) the frame number (such as the GSM Frame Number defined by the industry standard related to GSM communication systems) that is being transmitted at the identified CDMA time, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> (5) the particular portion of the frame being transmitted at the identified CDMA time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the disclosed method and apparatus, the first three bits of BSIC that identifies the Network Color Code is transmitted once for all of the channels to be searched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of how this information is used to reduce the amount of time required to determine whether there is an appropriate candidate station to which a handover can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is an illustration of a flowchart showing the process that takes place when an MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> wishes to determine whether it might be beneficial to perform a handover. It should be noted that the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> and described below may be performed either in response to a determination that the signal that is currently supporting communications to the MS is too weak, or upon any other triggering event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The process begins with a Candidate Frequency Search Request Message <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight> being transmitted from a MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> to a MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the disclosed method and apparatus, the Candidate Frequency Search Request Message has the following format including the fields shown in Tables 1-3:

<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the Candidate Frequency Search Request Message <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight>, the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> preferably estimates the amount of time that will be required for the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> to perform the requested searches. The estimate may be performed in any well know fashion. The estimate is transmitted to the MC-BS in a Candidate Frequency Search Response Message <highlight><bold>1507</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosed method and apparatus, the MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> responds to the Candidate Frequency Search Response Message <highlight><bold>1507</bold></highlight> by determining whether to perform a search, and if so, how the search is to be performed. For example, in one embodiment, the MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> transmits a Candidate Frequency Search Control Message indicating that the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> should begin performing a search at a predetermined start time (specified within the Control Message) and whether the search should be performed one time, continuously, or periodically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> responds to the Control Message by performing a search based upon the received information. The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> uses the timing information provided (i.e., the value provided in the CDMA Time field) to identify the time at which an identified portion of a GSM frame was sent to determine when to search for each GSM signal for which the MS-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> has requested the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> to search. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> will preferably search for each GSM only at the time when the GSM signal is transmitting identifying information, such as the BSIC. The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> can then both make signal quality measurements and also compare the BSIC with the BSIC associated with the channel for which the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> was requested to search. If there is a match, then the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> will report the quality of the signal being transmitted on the channel for which the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> was requested to search (such as the amount of power in the signal, the signal to noise ratio, or any other measure of signal quality). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> When the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> has determined the quality of the signal being transmitted on each of the channels for which the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> was requested to search, the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> will compose a Candidate Frequency Search Report Message <highlight><bold>1511</bold></highlight>. The Candidate Frequency Search Report Message <highlight><bold>1511</bold></highlight> is then transmitted from the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> to the MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the content of the Control Message, the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> may repeatedly transmit the Report Message <highlight><bold>1511</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> If the MS-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> determines that the conditions for a handover are ripe, then the MS-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> transmits messages <highlight><bold>1513</bold></highlight> to the GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> to prepare the GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> to accept the handover. One method used to transmit the messages to the GSM-BS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> are to encapsulate the information in a standard GSM handover message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> The handover message may include timing information regarding when to find the synchronization channel in cases in which there is substantial drift in the GSM timing with respect to CDMA timing. Such messages are known in the art and so are not described here in detail for the sake of simplicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Once the GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> receives the handover preparation message <highlight><bold>1513</bold></highlight>, an MC-MAP GSM Handover Command message <highlight><bold>1517</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> in conventional GSM format. The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> and the GSM-BSS then exchange System Acquisition and Access messages <highlight><bold>1519</bold></highlight> in essentially conventional fashion. The MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> then provides a Handover Complete Message <highlight><bold>1521</bold></highlight> to the GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>. The GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> and the MC-BS <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> then exchange Handover Complete Messages <highlight><bold>1523</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that if the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> can quickly identify signals being transmitted from one GSM-BSS <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>, then the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> will be able to determine when to monitor for signals being transmitted by other GSM-BSSs <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> of interest. Furthermore, since the Candidate Frequency Search Request Message <highlight><bold>1503</bold></highlight> includes information regarding each of the channels for which the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> is being requested to search, the search for signals associated with each of these channels can be done in a few time slots (each of which is only 0.5 milliseconds in duration). Accordingly, the presently disclosed method and apparatus allows an MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> to perform a search for a handover candidate without taking very much time (only a few milliseconds total) from the time that the MS <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> is receiving CDMA signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while the above disclosed embodiment is referenced to a GSM system, the presently disclosed method and apparatus applied equally to any TDMA system in which information is transmitted during well defined time slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiments are described hereinabove with reference to a particular hybrid GSM/CDMA system, it will be appreciated that the principles of the present invention may similarly be applied to effect mobile-assisted handovers in other hybrid communication systems, as well. Moreover, although the preferred embodiments make reference to specific TDMA- and CDMA-based communications standards, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and principles described above may also be used in conjunction with other methods of data encoding and signal modulation. The scope of the present invention encompasses not only the complete systems and communications processes described hereinabove, but also various innovative elements of these systems and processes, as well as combinations and sub-combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> It will thus be appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and the full scope of the invention is limited only by the claims.</paragraph>
