<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a suspension conveyance system used, for example, to support car bodies in factories manufacturing automobiles or to support and carry objects to be worked in various factories. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As for suspension conveyance systems of this type, there has heretofore been provided an arrangement found, for example, in Japanese Kokai (unexamined) Publication No. 6-156662. In this conventional arrangement, the main body frame of an overhead hanger carried on a given line is provided with receiving elements on the front and rear sides, respectively, for supporting a car body. Of both receiving elements, the one on the front side is fixed and the other, which forms a pair on the rear side, are respectively rotatably supported with respect to the main body frame side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> That is, a receiving-element support member is fixed on the main body frame side. This receiving-element support member has a shaft fitted therein, which shaft is rotatable and axially movable. The shaft has an eccentric position of the receiving element fixed at the upper end thereof and a rotary piece fixed at the lower end thereof In addition, the rotary piece is formed with a pair of driving holes which are symmetrically disposed, while the receiving-element support member is provided with a position holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Disposed at predetermined places in the line are front end pressing means, intermediate pressing means, and rear end pressing means, which are operable with respect to the main body frame side. Also disposed is an automatic switching device consisting of a releasing means and a rotating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With such a conventional arrangement, the overhead hanger is carried on the line and is brought to a stop with the receiving elements, now empty, on the rear side opposed to the automatic switching device. First, swing prevention of this main body frame side is effected by causing the front end pressing means, intermediate pressing means and rear end pressing means to act on the main body frame side. Then, the releasing means in the automatic switching device is lifted, and with its driving pin fitted in the driving hole, the receiving elements are lifted through the rotary piece and shaft so as to bring the positioning effected by the position holder in an open state. In this state, the receiving elements are rotated by the operation of the rotating means through the driving pin, rotary piece, shaft and the like. Thereafter, the receiving element side is lowered for the position holder to effect positioning. In this manner, the attitude of the receiving elements on the rear side is changed by the automatic switching device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the conventional arrangement described above, however, since the automatic switching device is arranged to change the attitude of the corresponding rear side receiving elements by operating the pair of releasing means and rotating means, there have been such problems that the arrangements and operations become complicated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a suspension conveyance system capable of changing support positions of right and left supports by a common changing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To achieve the object described above, a suspension conveyance system according to the invention comprises a movable body movable on a given path, the movable body having a support section for an object to be carried, and supports for supporting the object from below which are disposed in a lower portion of the support section on right and left sides of the support section such that a support position can be changed, wherein the given path includes therein a changing means disposed between the right and left supports to change the support position provided by the supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the above arrangement of the invention, the movable body is moved until it is stopped with the support section, now empty, opposed to the changing means, and then the changing means is activated, thereby changing the support position provided by the support members. Thus, a plurality of kinds of objects to be carried can each be supported in a stable manner. The use of the common (single) changing means simplifies the construction and operation and ensures that the change of the support position provided by the right and left support members is effected quickly and reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of a suspension conveyance system according to the invention, the changing means is movable between an operating position in the given path and a retreat position outside the given path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to this first embodiment, the changing means performs the operation of changing the support position provided by the support members in an operating position, but when not performing such operation, it is moved to the retreat position, whereby the maintenance, inspection, repair and the like, of the changing means can be effected without stopping the movement of the movable body on the given path and without involving any trouble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of a suspension conveyance system according to the invention, there is a positioning means for positioning the support members when the movable body is stopped at a position where it is opposed to the changing means in the given path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the second embodiment, the support position provided by the supports can be changed quickly and reliably by the changing means with respect to the support section which has effected positioning (swing prevention) by the positioning means after the movable body has been stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment of a suspension conveyance system according to the invention, there are stock sections for the support section below the given path, so that the changing means effects the switching of the support members between the support section and the stock section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the third embodiment, the common (single) changing means effects the changing of the support position provided by the right and left support members and the switching of a plurality of kinds of supports between the support section and the stock sections, thus making it possible to cope with a variety of objects to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, in a fourth embodiment of a suspension conveyance system according to the invention, the supports have removable attaching pins to be inserted into the support section from above and support pins capable of having an object to be carried fitted thereon from above. These attaching pins and support pins are transversely spaced from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the fourth embodiment, when the object to be carried is unloaded from the support section by upwardly disengaging it from the support pins, the frictional resistance in the fitting region between the support pins and the object to be carried produces a force which tends to lift the supports to extract the attaching pins from the support section so as to disengage the supports. At this time, since the attaching pins and the support pins are transversely spaced from each other, the lifting direction of the supports during disengagement of the object to be carried becomes an arcuate direction with the center thereof located at the attaching pin, thus increasing the frictional resistance in the attaching pin. As a result, the disengagement of the supports can be automatically prevented.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this case, the edge of the patch body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed with a recess <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with which the positioning pins <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are engageable. Further, the support pin <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is elliptic in section and is capable of having an object to be carried fitted thereon from above. And in the rear support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the support pin <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are transversely spaced a predetermined distance L apart from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, as for the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, symmetrical ones are prepared as a one-kind in one-set, and according to the kinds of objects to be carried, two kinds (a plurality of kinds) are prepared. That is, as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, symmetrical rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of another kind which differ both in the planar shape of the base member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and in the predetermined distance L with respect to the rear support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are prepared as a one-kind in one-set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> positioned between the right and left rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A for changing the support position provided by these rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. That is, the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises a base block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a robotic device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> disposed on the base block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a clamp section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> disposed on the front end arm section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the robotic device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the like. In this case, the front end arm section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is capable of moving vertically, transversely, longitudinally, and so on. And the clamp section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is capable of claming the pin bracket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The base block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is mounted on floor rails <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> laid to extend in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through a group of drive type wheels <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>; thus, the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is capable of moving between the operating position A in the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the retreat position B outside the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> for the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A are disposed at positions below the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and opposed to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this case, the stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are disposed on both sides of and equally spaced from the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is now moved to the operating position A. The front and rear stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> each have two rows, front and rear, (a single row or a plurality of rows), each row having many sections for stocking and are set at a height to avoid collision with the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A can be switched between the hanger device (support section) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, there is provided a positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for positioning the hanger device (support section) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is stopped at a position where it is opposed to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. That is, the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of right and left clamps <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> capable of clamping the vertical members <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an engaging/disengaging device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having a pin capable of engaging/disengaging a positioning hole <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>) formed in a bracket <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the support disposed section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The operation in the embodiment described above will now be described. In addition, the car body of an automobile, which is an example of an object to be carried, consists of, for example, of a first car body W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a second car body W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a third car body W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a fourth car body W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to the suspension conveyance system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the construction described above, normally, the traveling of the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is effected by the transmission projection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> engaging the driven projection <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Since the hold dog <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> abuts against such transmission projection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, uncontrolled traveling thereof is prevented. Further, the car bodies W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are supported at four points through the supports <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of the hanger <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> during normal traveling. At this time, a car body of a certain kind, for example, is supported and in the rear, as shown in solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the rear support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is set in the longitudinal intermediate position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this state, when the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are to be longitudinally displaced as shown in phantom lines D and E in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> so as to carry a different kind of car body, first, the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is caused to travel until it is stopped with the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, now empty, opposed to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At this time, the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is positioned in the operating position A, as shown in solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, whereas in the empty hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the portions below the frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, that is, the vertical members <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the like are bifurcated, so that these vertical members <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the like pass by both sides of the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This allows the empty hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to stop in opposed relationship to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> without colliding with the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has thus been stopped, first, both vertical member <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are clamped by both clamp devices <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and then the pin of the engaging/disengaging device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is lifted to engage the positioning hole <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, from below, which is formed in the support disposed section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the positioning (swing prevention) of the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is effected by the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this state, the operator operates the robotic device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> while freely moving its front end arm section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> vertically, transversely, longitudinally, and so on. Thereby, first, the clamp section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided on the front arm section <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, as shown in solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, clamps the pin bracket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> set in the longitudinal intermediate position, and then lifts the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to withdraw the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from the pin receiving hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Then, after the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> have been transversely moved until the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is opposed to an intended pin receiving hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from above, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are lowered to insert the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the pin receiving hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. During this insertion, the recess <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> formed in the edge of the patch body <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is engaged with the positioning pin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from above; thus, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are capable of positioning simultaneously with changing the support position. Thereby, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be set by being longitudinally displaced as shown in phantom lines D and E in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>; thus, car bodies of two other kinds can be supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, after the support position provided by the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has been changed by the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, both clamping devices <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and engaging/disengaging device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are reversely operated to open the positioning (swing prevention) of the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby completing a series of operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The support position provided by the right and left rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be changed in this manner by the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and similarly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the support position provided by the right and left rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A can be changed between the solid and phantom lines by the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As described above, after the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been stopped in opposed relationship to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A can be switched between the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the stock section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by operating the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. That is, the robotic device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is operated to release the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A) set on the support disposed section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> side, then to store them in predetermined locations in the stock section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, to take out the intended rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) stored in the stock section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and set them at the intended position on the support disposed section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, the support position provided by the right and left rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A can be changed by the common (single) changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and similarly, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A can be switched between the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the stock section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by the common changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Thus, either the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A are set in the intended position, thereby supporting the car body of the intended kind of automobile between them and the front supports <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, that is, supporting the car body by the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and carrying the same. At this time, the car body is fitted on the support pins <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the rear support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A from above and then abutted against the attaching members <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, whereby the car body is supported in a position-controlled manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> And after various operations have been completed while carrying the car body, the car body is unloaded from the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position, which unloading is effected by lifting the car body to upwardly disengage it from the support pins <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. At this time, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A are lifted as by frictional resistance in the fitting region between the support pins <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the car body, and the attaching pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are extracted from the pin receiving holes <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the receiving sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, thus producing a force which causes disengagement of the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> However, since the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A have the attaching pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and support pins <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> transversely spaced the predetermined distance L apart, the lifting direction of the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A during car body disengagement becomes an arcuate direction with its center located at the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thus increasing the frictional resistance produced between the inner peripheral surface of the pin receiving hole <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the outer peripheral surface of the attaching pin <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, so that the disengagement of the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A is automatically prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown in solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, performs the operation, in the operating position A in the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, of changing the support position provided by the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, as described above, but when it does not perform such operation, it may be moved to the retreat position B outside the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the base block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, as shown in phantom line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Such movement to the retreat position B allows the maintenance, inspection, repair and the like, of the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to be performed without any trouble and without stopping the movement (empty movement, real test movement or the like) of the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> side on the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is shown as a movable body; however, it may be a self-propelled body in the form of an electric train supported and guided by rails. Further, car bodies W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are shown as an object to be carried; however, they may be workpieces to be painted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the front supports <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are fixed while the support position provided by the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A is alterable; however, there may be used a different type in which rear supports are fixed while the support position provided by the front supports is alterable, or another type in which the support positions provided by the front and rear supports are alterable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the type is shown in which the robotic device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is used as the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for changing the support position provided by the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A; however, a different type may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is constructed to be movable between the operating position A in the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the retreat position B outside the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; however, it may be of a type in which it is fixed in the operating position A in the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is installed for positioning the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the trolley device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is stopped at a position where it is opposed to the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; however, the positioning means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be omitted in the case of a type which causes less swing or the like to the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> for the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A are disposed below the given path <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A may be switched between the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the stock sections <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; however, a different type may be used in which only the changing means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> changes the support position provided by the rear supports with respect to the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, with no stock sections prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the rear supports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A have the attaching pins <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> provided thereon which are disposed on the side of the hanger device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for insertion from above and the support pins <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provided thereon which are capable of having an object to be carried fitted thereon from above.
