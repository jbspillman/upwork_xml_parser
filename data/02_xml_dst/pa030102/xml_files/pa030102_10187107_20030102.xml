<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of this invention is fluid administration for medical purposes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Fluid administration is a common occurrence during medical care of animals. Such fluids include blood and blood products, hydration fluids, solutions for lavage and irrigation, and fluid drips for administration of pharmaceuticals. Medical research indicates that administration of fluids at normal body temperature (37&deg; C.) is desirable, and that administration of fluids cooler than body temperature can result in medical complications. Current technology for fluid warming is cumbersome and inconvenient, or very expensive, so medical personnel usually do not make the effort, take the time, or incur the expense to warm fluids before use unless the procedure is critical to patient care (such as during major surgery). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is also a need for accurate and time-sensitive administration of specific fluid volumes. Sometimes large quantities of liquids are necessary, such as treating dehydration or administering blood during severe trauma, and must be given quickly. At other times the quantities are smaller and more precise, such as when pharmaceuticals are administered. Medical personnel who administer large volumes of fluids, such as nurses and paramedics, do not have the ability to give patients partial bags of fluids accurately, nor can they afford to take the time to constantly monitor patients to ensure proper flow rate. Most often these caregivers estimate both quantity and flow rate of fluid administration because they are unable to specify optimal amounts and rates. Fluid management is used not only to administer fluids to patients. Fluids are also used as carriers of pressure and temperature for medical purposes. A hot water bottle is a familiar example of a fluid within a reservoir used to carry heat to a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The current art in fluid administration has not fully addressed the need for temperature management of those fluids. Because fluids are often given to a patient in an emergency setting, no time is taken to warm the fluids, which are often stored at cold or freezing temperatures, before they are delivered to the patient. When warming is attempted, it may be in the form of a caregiver sitting on a bag of fluid to use their body temperature to warm the fluid. The prior patent art describes many systems for fluid administration. Many of these patents describe systems with pumps and many of these systems describe systems with different types of heaters or cooling devices, but none of these systems provide both controlled pumping and temperature management of pre-filled reservoirs of sterile fluids prior to delivery in a portable design relevant to both field and hospital use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that there is a need for a fluid administration system that is both portable, quick to deploy, and easy too use while delivering fluids to patient at controlled flow rates and controlled temperatures. The systems of the prior art do not fulfill these requirements. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention is an apparatus and method for managing the delivery of fluids for medical purposes at physiologically appropriate temperatures. The apparatus described herein is a fluid administration system that will conveniently, quickly, and accurately manage the temperature and flow rate of medical fluids at the same time. The fluids are delivered to animals, or more specifically mammals, or more specifically yet, humans. The animal to which the fluids are delivered is a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The system comprises a control unit that contains the mechanism for heat exchange and pumping of a fluid that is contained within a disposable fluid administration set. The control unit is designed to operate on battery power to facilitate its use for emergency personnel, but can be plugged into standard wall outlets or 12-volt vehicle outlets for recharging or regular use. The ability of emergency personnel to administer temperature and rate-controlled fluids will greatly enhance field treatment of medical patients. The fluid administration set, further comprised by the system, is a disposable element that attaches at one end to a pre-existing fluid source and has a standard medical attachment at the other end for connecting to the patient. Within the length of the fluid administration set are a heat exchange and pumping cartridge, and the standard fluid line components such as a drip chamber and drug injection ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The apparatus includes a pumping mechanism for fluid propulsion, a temperature control device and heat transfer element that heats or cools the fluid, one or more receptacles that accept and hold in place a cartridge containing fluid. The cartridge optionally contains an information key enabled, for example by shape or electronics, that controls the temperature at which the apparatus will heat or cool the fluid, operator controls, and an energy source. The information key, on the cartridge, communicates information to the controller through a key interface on the controller. The pumping mechanism can be set to move specific volumes of fluid at a specified rate. The pump can operate at a low enough pressure and shear rates so as to deliver blood products without cell lysis. The temperature control unit heats or cools fluid to the specified temperature as the fluid moves through a separable cartridge within the receptacle. The desired fluid temperature will be achievable at all rates of flow as provided by the pumping mechanism. The energy source preferably incorporates a rechargeable battery system for portability or safety, although the unit can also be plugged into a standard wall socket. Use of chemical reactions as a heat source is also adaptable as a heating or cooling source. Operator controls determine flow rate, and heater on/off state. Other features include indicator lights for failure to achieve indicated flow, low battery power, pump shutoff if specified temperature is not achieved in cartridge, and overall proper functioning equipment status. The control unit also contains a data access port for monitoring parameters by outside equipment, or for specifying a sequence of temperature/pumping parameters by external equipment like a computer or data recorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention includes infusing a patient with fluids at a controlled rate that is determined by an active pumping system while controlling the temperature of the fluid through the use of an active heating or cooling system. The method of the invention further includes the use of a cartridge that is integral to the disposable fluid administration set and that interfaces with a controller, the cartridge performing heat transfer, pumping and parameter setting functions. The disposable fluid administration set comprises a line of tubing connected to a cartridge containing a pumping mechanism and heat exchanger. The cartridge fits into the separate control unit. The cartridge has a heat exchange surface that interfaces with a heater/cooler contained within the control unit, a pumping mechanism that interfaces with the pump contained within the control unit, and a channel through which the fluid will flow. The tubing is affixed onto the cartridge, which further contains a channel of sufficient length to provide the residence time needed for warming or cooling to occur at the rate of volume flow provided by the control unit pump or gravity. The cartridge selects the fluid temperature from the control unit by means of either mechanical or electrical signaling contained within the cartridge and detected by the control unit. The cartridge or the tubing optionally contains sensing elements detectable by the control unit for temperature and flow parameters, and the tubing may contain unidirectional valves. The end of the tubing from which flow is drawn shall have a connection appropriate for containers of fluids intended for intravenous administration to any mammal, and the end of the tubing toward which fluids are pumped shall have a connection appropriate to the site of administration of intravenous fluids to any mammal. The fluid administration set components should, preferably, not be separated from each other. The fluid to be delivered may be composed of any solution, including hydration fluids, blood products, crystalline or colloidal solutions, and pharmaceuticals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The control unit of this system may also be used to deliver warmed or cooled fluids to a therapy pad for medical uses such as muscle and joint therapy, dermatological interventions, and pain relief. The availability of a fluid therapy system with temperature controls that can be safely manipulated by both medical caregivers and the public for therapeutic purposes will greatly increase treatment options for a number of medical conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages and novel features of the invention are described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein. </paragraph>

The key interface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is affixed to the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or chassis <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> so that it is exposed within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as are the cartridge locking mechanisms <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> serves to protect the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the environment and provide a mounting platform for the controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> components. The chassis <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is affixed to the interior of the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and provides a solid mechanical and electrical platform on which to mount those components that are not directly affixed to the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The attachment clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provides mechanical and electrical connections for an accessory unit or module (not shown) to provide additional functions not specified here or to attach the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a stand or bracket (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provides a readily identifiable and robust attachment port into which the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (not shown) is inserted. The cartridge locking mechanisms <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to positively and reversibly engage with locking elements on the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Disposed within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into which the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> engage so as to provide heat exchange between the temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are preferably fabricated from metals such as but not limited to aluminum, stainless steel, copper, and the like, or other materials with high heat transfer capabilities. The temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are configured to maximize surface area and thus to maximize heat transfer. Such maximized surface area configurations include multiple fingers, flanges, projections, and the like. Also within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (only the surface is shown) that will interface with a diaphragm, tubing, or other pumping surface on the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can, for example, be a roller pump, a piston pump, a cam pump, a rocker arm, or the like. The operator can specify flow rate with increase/decrease buttons <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and turn the pump on and off with on/off switch <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> if gravity flow is preferred. An indicator light <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or other display allows a visual check at a distance by an operator to see if the unit is operating properly. There is also the alphanumeric display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of both flow and temperature for more precise monitoring of the current settings. The alphanumeric display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be of any type such as but not limited to LED, LCD, TFT, plasma, CRT and the like. The temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be manually turned off with the on/off switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> if desired or they may be operated by a logic device or computer (not shown) within the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The side of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> opposite the accessory attachment clip <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes accommodations for the power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The battery pack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed so that it is easily accessible even when units are stacked. The battery pack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is optionally rechargeable and replaceable. Battery chemistries typical of the state of the art are appropriate for this application. Such battery chemistries include but are not limited to lead acid, nickel metal hydride, lithium ion and the like. A power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the power cord <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is disposed near to the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and serves as an internal recharging system for the battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to accept both 110 VAC US and 240 volt-AC international power configurations as well as the 12-volt DC power that is available on most motor vehicles. Both batteries <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and power supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into the body of the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or be separable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> All switches are preferably backlit and color-coded to help identify which features are on or off, and to help operators distinguish features quickly and easily. The display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the control unit provides for easy confirmation of temperature and flow in both high and low light conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is part of a self-contained modular system designed to allow a caregiver to deliver temperature-controlled fluids <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a specified rate for medical applications. These medical applications include fluids for intravenous administration, as well as fluids used to wash tissues or surfaces (lavage and irrigation). Within this context, having fluids at a specified temperature, and flowing at a specified rate, is desirable for health and comfort of the patient. The specific embodiment presented here is not the only form of the device. In another embodiment, the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a reusable case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> containing the elements necessary to manage fluid supplied through the disposable cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is designed to be robust enough for field use by emergency personnel, and is also appropriate for use within any medical facility. Such robustness requires that the device can withstand mishandling and severe impact forces. Designs for robustness preferably include rubberized coatings on the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and high strength connections between the case <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> the chassis <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and all components. Additionally, the componentry is preferably of high reliability type and able to withstand high G loads. The control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is self-contained and portable, weighing approximately less than 20 pounds and capable of operation when not connected to an external power source. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, at the point of contact with a reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the fluid administration set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises the spike <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to penetrate the fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The inflow tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is affixed to the spike <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at one end and to the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at the other end. The optional drip chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is affixed at an intermediate point to the inflow tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to allow operator verification of fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> flow by visual examination. The cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, into which the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> flows, will provide a frame for pumping and heating or cooling the fluid. Each cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a label <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> affixed on the front surface. The label <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> describes the characteristics of the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, particularly the temperature at which fluid is to be delivered as set by the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Within the frame, case or outer surface of the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and exposed to the exterior is a pumping element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, such as a diaphragm, rotary component, or collapsible volumetric component such as tubing. The heat exchange surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are affixed to the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outer surface on the top, bottom, sides or back. The information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is affixed to the outer surface of the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The locking structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a feature either affixed to or integral to the outer surface of said cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The cartridge is affixed to the inlet side of the length of outlet tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The distal end of the outlet tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is affixed to the Luer port <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The roller clamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is reversibly attached around, and constricts, the outlet tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to a variable degree at some intermediate location. The injection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is affixed at an intermediate location on the outlet tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the pumping element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, interacting with the pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, contained within the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, moves the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and fluid administration set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is inserted into the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and interfaces with the heat exchange surfaces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the plurality of fins or other high surface area structures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. These temperature element surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> become in intimate contact with similar temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Ideally, the temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are reverse or mirror image projections of the temperature element surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and allow for reversible interlocking or intimate contact between said surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes through the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, is set to a specified temperature and flow rate by the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then exits the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> through outflow tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to a patient <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (not shown). There will be contained, within the outflow tubing, various points of intervention for a caregiver, such as an optional roller clamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the at least one injection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for pharmaceuticals. The outflow tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> terminates in the Luer adaptor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, other connection commonly used for patient care, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a modular system comprising a reusable, self-contained, controller <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a disposable fluid administration set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> designed to allow a caregiver to deliver temperature-controlled fluids at a specified rate within a medical context. This includes fluids for intravenous administration, as well as fluids used to wash tissues or surfaces (lavage and irrigation). Within this context, having fluids at a specified temperature, and flowing at a specified rate, is desirable for health and comfort of the patient. The specific embodiment presented here is not the only possible form of the device. The current embodiment of the fluid administration set is the fluid inflow line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the structurally rigid or semi-rigid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that inserts into the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> within this modular system, and the outflow line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that delivers the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This fluid administration set is designed to be robust enough for field use by emergency personnel, and is also appropriate for use within any medical facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes methods of administering fluids <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a patient <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are delivered at a set rate determined by active pumping and at a set temperature determined by control values and enabled through the use of heaters and/or cooling devices that interface with the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The fluid inflow line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the fluid outflow tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are preferably fabricated as extrusions of polymers such as but not limited to PVC, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane and the like. The extrusions comprise an inlet end and an outlet end. The extrusions further comprise a wall and an inner lumen that is isolated from the environment by the wall. The inside diameters of the tubing typically ranges from less than 1 mm to over 20 mm. The extrusions used in fabricating the tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may optionally comprise insulating layers of foam, air, or the like to minimize heat loss to the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The spike <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, drip chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, injection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the roller clamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the Luer fitting <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are preferably fabricated by injection molding from polymers such as but not limited to PVC, PET, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate and the like. The hardness of the polymers used in these parts is generally higher than the hardness of the polymers used to fabricate the tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The fluid injection port <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is configured as a T or Y configuration with the inlet line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> affixed to one port, the outlet line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> affixed to another port and the third port used in conjunction with a valve (such as a stopcock) or a seal, which is typically made of an elastomer, to allow fluid to be injected without leakage once the fluid source is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The fluid administration apparatus and method is appropriate for any medical fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and can be used to deliver fluids for any purpose. The cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has a pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for fluid circulation, a temperature sensor and/or a flow sensor or information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to provide feedback or control input to the control unit, shaped protrusions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with heat exchange surfaces that interface with similar protrusions within the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These protrusions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> maximize heat transfer between temperature elements in the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> also comprises a locking structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that allows locking of the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when it is fully inserted into control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and which then reversibly engages the locks <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to lock the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into place and enhance contact between the two heat exchange surfaces. Such locking mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> could include electromagnets in the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that pull on ferrous magnetic strips on the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or other mechanical means such as cams, spring clips, or thee like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> pre-sets the temperature and/or flow rate to which the control unit will maintain the temperature and flow rate of the fluid being delivered. The information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is selected by the user or caregiver based on the label <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> visible on the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or other part of the fluid administration set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be further connected to a temperature or flow rate sensor within the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or fluid administration set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be a mechanical device, an electrical device, a magnetic device, an optical device or a combination of these. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is coupled or interfaced to the key interface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the controller. Such key interface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be electrical, magnetic, optical, mechanical or a combination of these. The key interface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> sends information directly to the a logic circuit, computer or controller within the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although these are functions supplied by the interaction between the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will be as simple as possible, and the adaptations and detection mechanisms will chiefly be designed for the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This technology must also be gentle enough to deliver all fluids <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, including blood products that are prone to lysis, so the pumping mechanism will operate at low pressure or low shear rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The temperature setting will be controlled by an element or key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> within the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that the operator can install the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and know that the temperature is predetermined. This is an important safety feature since the device will be used by emergency medical personnel under adverse field conditions. Predetermined settings assure that inadvertent bumps against the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will not alter any parameters critical to patient safety. However, there will be cartridges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that do not contain a temperature-setting information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> so that control units with a specialized data port can receive more complicated instructions from an operator or from other equipment (such as a computer). This information may be provided by color coded cartridges and/or the label <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The high surface area to volume ratio of the multiple protrusions in the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are designed to assure that appropriate temperature will be achieved at all rates of flow that can be provided by the pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The majority of the walls of the protrusions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be heat exchange surfaces that interface between the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Full contact of the two temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is accomplished by a mechanism that engages when the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is inserted into the receptacle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Through mechanical and/or magnetic or other means, the temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are moved into greater proximity to the heat exchange surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that upstream pressure on the flexible heat exchange surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, as well as pressure from the pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> against the pumping element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> within the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> achieves full contact between the heat exchange surfaces <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is monitored by a thermocouple, mechanical key, or other sensor or information key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> within the fluid cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and detected by the key interface <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> within the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. One mechanism for regulating fluid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> temperature can be the operation of only as many temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the heat exchanger as are needed to achieve the desired fluid temperature. This feature also allows redundancy as protection against the failure of individual temperature elements. A more preferred embodiment is a simple on-off logic circuit for the temperature elements that functions by heating when the temperature is too low and not heating when the temperature reaches the desired value. A rate control unit may be desirable to minimize overshoot and keep the system critically damped. The temperature elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be standard resistive devices such as those fabricated from high-resistance wire such as nickel-chromium or ceramics and which provide Ohmic heating. The heat exchange surface may itself be the heating element to minimize energy loss. Also, various reversible exothermic chemical reactions may be incorporated for energy storage and fast initial warm-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will not be fundamentally different from other tubing systems in that it encompasses the standard features-standard connectors at both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in-line drip chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for visual verification of flow, roller clamps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or other devices to stop flow if necessary by mechanical intervention, and injection port or ports <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for administration of pharmaceuticals. The tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may differ from other fluid administration sets in that the outflow tubing <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be insulated to protect against temperature loss in cases of low fluid flow rates or low ambient temperatures such as can be found in emergency and other field conditions. Insulation may be achieved by external sources, such as an insulated wrap separate from the fluid line, or may be intrinsic to the line such as an embedded tube within a tube with an insulating air layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The power source incorporates a rechargeable battery pack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for portability and safety during energy outages. The battery <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is exchangeable to allow continuous use of one control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with multiple battery packs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will have an extension power cord <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with adaptor that allows for operation from power sources such as but not limited to a standard wall outlet or a 12-volt system such as those found in emergency vehicles like ambulances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Operator controls will determine flow rate, heating, and system on/off. Some embodiments of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will have an optional data port that will allow the operator or another device such as a computer to specify the functions of the control unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Such a data port can be an RS-232, USB or the like. For computer-controlled embodiments there could be a cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, optionally, without specifications for temperature (since the cartridge sets the temperature in all other circumstances) or the computer controls could be set to override the cartridge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> temperature set key. For verification of which functions are activated, the on/off buttons will be backlit. There are also flow control buttons <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with indicator arrows to increase or decrease flow from the current rate. The display <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the front panel, switches, and indicator lights <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and others will allow for monitoring of the unit at a glance, and displays of flow and temperature information will be designed for visibility in both high light and low light conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> While certain embodiments of the invention have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms; furthermore, various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the methods and systems described herein may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
