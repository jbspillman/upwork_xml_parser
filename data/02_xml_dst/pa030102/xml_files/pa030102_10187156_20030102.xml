<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates in general to wheelchairs, and specifically to a wheelchair driven by an electric motor according to a constantly applied physical motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many people are physically disabled and bound to wheelchairs. Some of these people are of such an age or level of mental development that they are unable to maturely handle a standard joystick-type powered wheelchair. For example, imagine a two year old child with a degenerative muscular disease that prevents her from using a fully manual wheel chair. It is very desirable that she and other children in similar situations be able to move about under their own volition due to the importance of exploration to a young child&apos;s development. Such children are too young to responsibly manage a standard joystick-type electric wheelchair, and thus it is desirable to provide a device that will produce motion only in response to a continuous physical motion. This need for physical input automatically limits the range and speed that the child may move because she will eventually get tired and stop. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of a wheelchair drive device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to the attached FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Although the following embodiments are discussed in the context of an automatic wheelchair drive device, those skilled in the art will recognize that many of the features and advantages recited herein may be realized in connection with other devices and systems, and such embodiments are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, it should be recognized that no single feature or element should be considered essential or solely responsible for the successful practice of the embodiments described herein. In the attached figures, wires indicating electrical connections have been omitted in order to avoid confusion. Those skilled in the art will understand how to connect the various electrical components upon a reading of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as illustrated schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the device comprises a mechanical subsystem and an electronic subsystem. The user sends control signals to a computer or controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by providing a substantially continuous physical motion applied to an input device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A suitable continuous motion may comprise rotation of a hand crank, linear displacement of a lever, or any other continuous or repeatable motion. A signal, such as a DC current, is then supplied to a motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that drives a wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted in front of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the hand crank preferably results in corresponding forward or backward motion of the chair. The user can also steer and stop the chair using a single set of controls. Steering is accomplished by moving the input assembly <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> left or right in a direction opposite to the intended turn. A brake may be configured to automatically engage a wheel when the motor stops running. The device may also be configured to be easily removable from the wheelchair so that the chair may be used without the drive device or may be folded up for transportation or storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> receives a digitally encoded signal from the hand crank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, determines the amplitude and direction of the signal and outputs a proportional signal to the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this way, clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the hand crank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be used to create forward or backward motion of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Similarly, an increase or decrease in a rate of hand crank rotation may result in faster or slower motion of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. According to the present embodiment, the signal is received from the input device <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> by a first digital encoder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A second digital encoder <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be used to create an automatic feedback loop <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> that mounts a wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in front of a wheelchair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may include a fork <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, such as a bicycle fork for mounting the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a transmission <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being driven by a controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which receives a signal from an input device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The output signal from the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> corresponds in magnitude and direction to the input from the hand crank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The motor is mounted to the frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> above the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is coupled to the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through a transmission <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the transmission comprises a speed reducer, a chain, and a torque limiter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The rotational hand crank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is shown attached to an extension arm <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that is inserted into a fork <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that is pivotable within a head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is attached to the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by a combination of a main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having a cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a pair of tensioning cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Attached to the fork <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is preferably a rigid triangular frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to support the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a portion of the transmission <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The triangular frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be attached to the fork by any suitable method such as by welds, bolts, adhesives, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrates a possible mounting system for mounting the device to the chair. In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted to the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at five attachment points. The main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted to an existing cross bar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the chair by inserting a free end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into a stem <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> attached to a lower bracket <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> mounted to a cross member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The lower bracket <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> shown comprises first and second halves having channels formed therein. The channels are configured to receive a structural member of the chair such as the cross member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The halves may be clamped to one another by screws, bolts, or any other method such that a cross-member of the chair is sandwiched therebetween. A rubber shim or gasket may be placed around the cross member in order to protect a painted surface of the cross member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may comprise any suitable material in any appropriate size and shape that it performs as described herein. For example, a thin-walled steel tube may be appropriate for some arrangements. Alternatively, aluminum, composite, or other material tubes may also be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to the main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such that the cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is substantially perpendicular to the main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may comprise a solid rod, or hollow tube of any suitable material such that it provides substantially rigid support to the main support member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> slides into mounting brackets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on each of the two vertical chair members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and may be located by a pair of shaft collars <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or other devices which surround the mounting brackets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more cables attached to a portion of the main support member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and extending to the vertical members of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be made from any suitable material. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to allow the cross support member to be somewhat bendable in order to allow the cables to be tensioned to raise the wheels a more substantial distance as will be recognized by those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A cross support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> mounted in a mounting bracket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown, the mounting brackets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprise a plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with an angled slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed therein. The plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is generally attached to a clamping member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which is configured to surround and clamp to an upright member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the wheelchair. The plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be attached to the clamping member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by welds, adhesives, or any other method recognized as suitable. The angle of the slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be formed such that it will be substantially parallel to the stem <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), such that the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be easily installed and removed from the brackets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Hooks <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be provided on either side of the head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> such that cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may extend from the hooks <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to portions of the base of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Brackets or hooks may be provided on the base of the chair for attachment of the cables thereto. Alternatively, the cables may be attached directly to existing structural features of the chair (such as a bolt head as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be tensioned by turnbuckles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> or other device such that an upward force is applied to the front of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> substantially near the front wheels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This upwardly-directed vertical force is preferably sufficient to raise the front wheels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> out of contact with the ground <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, thereby creating a three-wheeled vehicle. The cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be any suitable material known to those skilled in the art, such as steel, nylon, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned at a point along the length of the main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such that the cross support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> intersects with the vertical members <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When tightened using the turnbuckles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provide a force between a lower portion of the chair such as the posts located just above the front wheels <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> such that the front wheels of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are lifted slightly off the ground <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This provides sufficient contact between the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the ground <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to allow rotation of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to propel the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The hand-crank <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, converts the physical input of the user to a signal that is fed to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a rotational digital encoder <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is mounted to the hand crank <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that a digital signal is provided to the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, analog devices such as a rotational potentiometer or a generator may be employed to create an analog signal to be supplied to an analog controller. In some embodiments it may be desirable to provide a second digital or analog device <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> at an output of the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to provide feedback for an automatic speed control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The input device <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, generally comprises a two-piece input bracket <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which holds a bearing housing <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The bearing housing <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is placed between the two pieces of the input bracket <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The hand cranks <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> may be attached to the shaft with a quick-release screw for easy removal of the cranks <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The hand crank arms <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from steel, plastic, aluminum or other suitable material. The input bracket <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be adjustably attached to an extension tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is attached to a stem <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> placed in the head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The extension tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown is square and has slots on two opposite faces, which allow bolts <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> extending from inside the tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be used to adjustably mount the tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the stem <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and the bracket <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may comprise other cross-sectional shapes such that it may perform as shown and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As will be clear to those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure, the input device <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is generally provided in a position relative to the chair such that a user may comfortably reach and apply a continuous motion to the input device as well as employing the input device to steer the chair. In order to facilitate various sizes of users, the position of the input device may be adjustable as described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The drive train may comprise a small motor, speed reducers, a torque limiter, and a chain. In one embodiment, a plastic and steel cable-chain <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> (manufactured for example by W M Berg, inc) is employed to drive a sprocket <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> attached directly to the wheel hub <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. A worm wheel speed reducer may be employed to drive the wheel sprocket via the cable chain. The worm wheel speed reducer has the particular advantage that it cannot be easily back-driven, and will thus provide a braking force to resist the motion of the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not running. Alternatively, a brake such as a centrifugal clutch, or a caliper brake may be used to stop unwanted motion of the chair. The Berg cable chain has the particular advantages that it is quiet, has zero backlash, requires no lubrication, and is resistant to rust. Thus the chain will not be subjected to shock loading caused by backlash, and will operate substantially smoothly without grease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The triangular motor frame <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from right-angle stock steel and attached to the fork <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which is pivotally mounted to the head tube <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, square, circular, or other cross-sectional material may be used to form a suitable frame. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of materials and methods may alternatively be used to form a frame as shown and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably of such a size that it may be suitably proportional to the wheelchair to be used. In one embodiment, the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has an externally threaded hub <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the wheel sprocket <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> to be used for the chain <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> may be threaded to match the threads of the wheel hub <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. The sprocket <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> may then be threaded onto the wheel hub <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, and locked into place using a lock ring, nut or other suitable device. A thread locking adhesive may also be used to ensure that the sprocket remains tightly attached to the hub. A tensioning sprocket <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be provided in order to maintain sufficient tension in the cable chain <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. The tensioning sprocket <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a pivoting arm <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> which may be biased by a spring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> in order to provide the desired tension. The pinion sprocket <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> attaches directly to the output shaft of the worm wheel speed reducer, and is secured to the shaft by one or more set screws or other suitable method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the drive train is arranged to provide a maximum chair speed of about 3 ft per second. In this way, the chair may not significantly exceed an average walking pace, and thus the user will not be able to move faster than an attendant can walk. In another embodiment, a mechanical or electrical hi/lo switch may be disposed within the transmission in order to allow an attendant to switch the chair between a high and low speed mode. In the low speed mode, the chair is preferably limited to a maximum speed of about 1 foot per second. A torque limiter may also be used. In one embodiment the torque limiter is placed on a relatively low torque setting in order to avoid breakage of the chain in the event of the user attempting to drive the chair when motion is stalled due to an obstacle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As described, the drive device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably removably mounted to the wheelchair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such that it may be removed from the chair for transportation or storage. The process of attaching and removing the drive device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. In order to remove the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the tension in the cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is removed by loosening the turnbuckles <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Once a sufficient amount of tension has been removed, the cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be removed from the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Once the cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are removed, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may simply be lifted away from the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> thereby removing the cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from the mounting brackets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on either side of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and removing the main support member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the stem <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the lower bracket <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be attached to the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> simply by inserting the stem <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the lower bracket <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into the main support tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and aligning the cross-member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the mounting brackets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and finally attaching and re-tensioning the cables <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> until the front wheels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the chair are lifted off the ground <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the transmission may be configured to drive the rear wheels of the wheelchair. In this embodiment, the rear wheels may be driven simultaneously, or independently, or with a drive shaft and differential. In this embodiment, steering may be managed by independently driving the rear wheels at different speeds, or by providing a steering apparatus mounted to the front wheels. Those skilled in the art will recognize that if a steering apparatus is used, the rear wheels should be driven with a differential to allow for the rear wheels to rotate at different speeds during turning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally enclosed in a housing, and placed at any suitable location on the drive device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the cross-support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A power source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, such as a battery is also supplied, and mounted to any appropriate portion of the chair <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
