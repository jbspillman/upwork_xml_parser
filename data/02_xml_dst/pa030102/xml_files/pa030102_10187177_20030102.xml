<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to radio frequency amplifiers, and more particularly, to reducing the distortion from a balanced radio frequency power amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Radio frequency (RF) amplifiers are used in a wide variety of applications, including communications. Ideally the transfer function of an RF amplifier is linear, with the output of the amplifier being an amplified replica of the input to the amplifier. However, conventional RF amplifiers typically have some degree of non-linearity in their transfer function, particularly at high power levels such that different signal frequencies will be amplified by different amounts. This non-linearity in an RF amplifier produces distortion in the RF amplifier output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Distortion in the RF amplifier output can reach levels that are unacceptable. For example, to meet the requirements of many CDMA modulation standards, power amplifier outputs need to exhibit very low distortion. If some type of linearization or distortion reduction technique is not used, the RF amplifier can have poor efficiency or require high cost components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many distortion reduction techniques use a distortion generator to cancel the distortion generated within a main RF power amplifier. These techniques generally assume that the low power distortion generator has a non-linear transfer function that is either similar to, or opposite from, the non-linear transfer function of the main RF amplifier. The output of the distortion generator, which exhibits the non-linear transfer function, is sampled and used to generate a signal that is combined with the output of the main RF power amplifier in an attempt to cancel the distortion present in the RF amplifier output. A drawback to this technique is that, for the signal combining to result in cancellation the non-linear transfer function of the distortion generator must match the non-linear transfer function of the main RF amplifier. This match can be difficult to achieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another distortion reduction technique, the feedforward technique, overcomes the difficulty in providing a distortion generator that has a non-linear transfer function that matches the main RF amplifier. Rather, the feedforward technique samples the main RF amplifier output, which includes both the desired transmitted signal and amplifier induced distortion. The sampled output of the main RF amplifier is then combined with a sample of the amplifier input signal such that the two sampled signals destructively combine, leaving only the distortion from the main amplifier. The resulting distortion signal is then amplified using an error amplifier and is added at the output of the main RF amplifier with the gain and phase adjusted such that the error amplifier output destructively combines with the main RF amplifier output and cancels the amplifier induced distortion present in the output of the main RF amplifier. A drawback to the feedforward distortion reduction technique is that the power handling capability required of the error amplifier is based on the magnitude of the distortion. The feedforward technique can provide good performance when improving the linearity of low distortion amplifiers, however, when this technique is applied to an amplifier that is operating close to its compression point, the error amplifier power requirement may become excessively large, making this technique impractical and unsatisfactory for many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> From the discussion above, it should be apparent that there is a need for a system that can provide linearization of an amplifier throughout its operating range, for example when it is operating close to its compression point, without requiring excessively large error amplifier power levels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A method and apparatus for reducing distortion in the output of a balanced RF power amplifier samples the distortion of the main RF power amplifier output and also reduces the power handling capability required for the error amplifier. A circuit that can provide these features measures the difference between the output from one portion of the balanced RF power amplifier and a sample of the amplifier input. This difference signal, which represents the amplifier distortion, can then be combined at the input to another portion of the balanced RF power amplifier. The amplitude and phase of the difference signal can be adjusted such that the distortion produced from the respective portions of the balanced RF amplifier are cancelled when the respective outputs are combined to produce the balanced RF amplifier output. Because the distortion generated in each portion of the balanced RF power amplifier should be similar, the distortion in one portion of the RF power amplifier is used to minimize the distortion in other portions of the RF power amplifier. In addition, this technique uses one portion of the balanced RF amplifier to amplify the difference signal to the desired level and thereby does not require a powerful error amplifier. Also, because the difference signal is injected into the input signal in front of the power amplifier, this technique does not require additional couplers following the main RF power amplifier output. The elimination of additional couplers after the main RF power amplifier can result in a lower cost design that provides improved efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the main RF power amplifier can include multiple amplifying devices that produced a combined output signal. The distortion produced in one of the amplifying devices can be sampled and used to cancel the distortion from all of the multiple amplifying devices to minimize the distortion in the main amplifier output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, a tone, or pilot signal, can be injected into the termination port of a balanced amplifier input splitter. The amplitude of the tone or pilot signal that is present in a balanced RF amplifier output combiner termination port can be detected and used as an input to an adaptation loop to minimize the tone, or pilot signal present in the output combiner termination port. By injecting the tone or pilot signal in the splitter termination port, the tone is isolated from the output of the balanced amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention should be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment, which illustrates, by way of example, principles of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a balanced distortion reduction circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for reducing the distortion from a balanced RF main power amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by sampling the output of the main amplifier with reduced power handling requirements for an error amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An RF input signal <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is introduced into the circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through an RF splitter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The RF splitter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> directs a portion of the input signal to a input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The input splitter also directs a portion of the input signal to a distortion phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The output <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is routed to the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is configured to receive the output of the input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, divide the received signal to produce two splitter output signals <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and provide one of the output signals <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> into each of two balanced amplifying devices in the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there are two balanced amplifying devices, a first amplifier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a second amplifier <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> embodiment, the input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> divides the received attenuator/phase shifter signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in half and provides equal-strength signals to the first and second amplifying devices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can divide the signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into signals of different strengths and can apply the different strength signals to the first and second amplifying devices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the output of the first amplifying device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is sampled using a sampling coupler <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The output of the sampling coupler <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is a sampled signal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which includes the distortion introduced by the first amplifying device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The sampled signal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is then combined with a sample of the split RF input signal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a distortion combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The input signal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is received at the combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the RF splitter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is controlled such that the gain and phase of the sampled output signal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> will combine destructively with the sampled input signal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, leaving only a difference, or distortion signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> output from the distortion combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Those of skill in the art will understand how to control the input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to achieve the desired effect recited herein. The distortion signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from the combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then applied to a distortion phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Depending on the distribution of gain within the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a low power error amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> might be useful to adjust the distortion signal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to a desired level. The output of the attenuator and phase shifter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and of the optional error amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides an adjusted distortion signal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The adjusted distortion signal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is then applied to a distortion combiner <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in front of the second amplifying device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The distortion combiner <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> combines the output signal <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> received from the input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the adjusted distortion signal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and outputs a combined signal into the second amplifying device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The gain and phase of the distortion phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are adjusted to give maximum cancellation of the distortion in the signal at the output <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the balanced main amplifier output <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Techniques for adjusting the gain and phase of the input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the distortion phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are well known to those skilled in the art, who will be able to select a suitable technique to accommodate various design considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an optional tone or pilot signal <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> can be injected into a termination port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the balanced amplifier input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to key a reduction in output distortion. The distortion phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be adjusted until the detected tone or pilot signal produced from the balanced amplifier output combiner <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> termination port <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is minimized. In this arrangement, the injected pilot signal <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is isolated from the amplifier output. The pilot signal can be a single frequency. In other embodiments, the pilot signal <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> might take other forms, for example, a noise signal, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signal, or multiple desired frequencies, or a single frequency that changes or hops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a balanced distortion circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that includes a delay matched first loop <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In all the drawings, like reference numerals refer to like items, so it should be apparent that the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has some elements in common with the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, a delay line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in front of the combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is used to match the delay of the sampled input signal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> coming from the RF splitter <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the sampled power amplifier output signal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The use of the delay line <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> improves the signal cancellation in the first loop <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> over a wider bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a balanced distortion reduction circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that includes a delayed matched second loop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a delayed matched first loop <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> delay line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is included in front of the second amplifying device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thereby enables the cancellation in the second loop <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to be effective over a wider bandwidth. The addition of the delay line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> following the first amplifying device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and in front of the output coupler <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> maintains the delay match between the two amplifying devices <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram that illustrates a balanced reduction circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> applied to an N-way combined main RF amplifier. In this embodiment, the technique described above can be used in an amplifier that has more than two amplifying devices in the main RF power amplifier. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the application of this technique to a main RF power amplifier <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> with four power amplifying devices, including a first amplifying device <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and second through fourth amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively. As before, the input phase shifter and attenuator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is controlled such that the gain and phase of the sampled output signal <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> will combine destructively with the sampled input signal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the distortion combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, leaving only a difference, or distortion signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> output from the distortion combiner. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> embodiment, the output of the error amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprising the adjusted distortion signal is routed to an error signal splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that divides the error signal output so as to apply the appropriate error signal to a respective distortion combiner <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> located at the input to each of the remaining amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The main amplifier input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> divides the signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> from the attenuator and phase shifter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into N signals of equal strength to be applied to each of the N power amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the error signal splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> divides the error signal output from the error amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into equal strength portions to be applied to the input of each distortion combiner <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can divide the input signal <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> into signals of different strengths to be sent to the amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> whose output is not sampled by the sampling coupler <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the error signal splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can divide the error signal into appropriate signal strengths to correspond to the respective input signal strengths and to be applied to the remaining amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Thus, the error splitter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will apportion the error signal according to the gains of the amplifying devices <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the magnitudes of the signals they will receive from the input splitter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this way, cancellation of distortion in the signal at the combined RF output <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the balanced main amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
