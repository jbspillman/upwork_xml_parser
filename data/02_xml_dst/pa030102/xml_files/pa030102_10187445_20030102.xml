<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a semiconductor laser device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has been provided. This semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> made of n-Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>As (x&equals;0.5 or so), an active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> made of Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>As (x&equals;0.1 or so), a p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> made of p-Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>As (x&equals;0.5 or so) and having a ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> placed on the ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and made of p-GaAs, a current constriction layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> positioned on widthwise both sides of the ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and on the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and made of n-GaAs, and a p-GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed with a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m, where the thickness from the lower end of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the thickness from the upper end of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are made generally equal to each other and smaller than 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used as a light source in such an optical pickup of an optical disk system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. A laser beam emitted from a widthwise central portion of the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor laser device is split into a main beam and a sub-beam by a diffraction grating <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, which are then reflected by a half mirror <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and converged to an optical disk <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> by an objective lens <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A laser beam reflected by the optical disk <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, passing through the objective lens <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and through the half mirror <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, is received by an unshown photodetector and thereby converted to a reproduced signal. Part of the laser beam reflected by the optical disk <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, especially the sub-beam is reflected by the half mirror <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, returning through the diffraction grating <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This return beam returning to the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comes incident at positions away from the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor laser device by about 60 &mgr;m on thicknesswise both sides of the semiconductor laser device. This semiconductor laser device is so made that the thickness from the lower end of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the thickness from the upper end of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> become generally equal to each other and smaller than 60 &mgr;m. Therefore, of the return beam, only part of the return beam lower than the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> comes incident on an end face portion A of a stem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> on which the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mounted. With this arrangement, the return beam is prevented from coming incident on both the end face portion A of the stem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and an end face portion B of the semiconductor laser device, as in an optical pickup including such a semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in which an active layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is formed so as to be decentered toward the thicknesswise lower side as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. Thus, the optical pickup of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is made smaller in return-beam reflection amount than the optical pickup of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, so that read signals derived from the return beam reaching again the optical disk and detected by the photodetector undergo less deterioration in S/N (Signal-to-Noise) ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is manufactured in the following processes. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, an active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and a cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are stacked one on another by MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) process at a temperature of 700-750&deg; C. Then, widthwise both side portions of the cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as well as widthwise both side specified-depth portions of the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> measured from its top surface are removed to form a ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and further an n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is grown on the cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> by MOCVD process (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>). In the n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, during its growth by the MOCVD process, n-GaAs is grown into a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the surface that is subjected to growth, so that a protruding portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> protruding from widthwise both side portions at a widthwise central portion of the n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> positioned above the ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed. With a resist mask <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> set on widthwise both sides of this protruding portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the n-GaAs layer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference>), the protruding portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the n-GaAs layer is removed by etching, and then the resist mask <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is removed, by which a current constriction layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</cross-reference> is formed on widthwise both sides of the ridge portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, p-GaAs is grown on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and on the cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by slow cooling LPE (Liquid Phase Epitaxial) process, by which a contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed. Thus, the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is completed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). During the formation of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by the slow cooling LPE process, the growth temperature is controlled to a highest of about 800&deg; C. so that a relatively thick contact layer having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m is formed reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another manufacturing method of the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, p-GaAs is grown on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by MOCVD process to form the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further method using the slow cooling LPE process for manufacturing the semiconductor laser device is available, the method including the steps of forming a first clad layer, an active layer and a lower-side second clad layer on a semiconductor substrate, forming thereon a current constriction layer having a striped groove, and forming an upper-side second clad layer on this current constriction layer by the slow cooling LPE process. In this semiconductor device manufacturing method, the upper-side second clad layer is formed by filling the groove of the current constriction layer by slow cooling LPE process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in which the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed by slow cooling LPE process, since the highest of growth temperatures for the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is about 800&deg; C., dopants of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> diffuse due to the highest temperature, causing the carrier concentration distribution to change as a problem. Further, dopants of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> diffuse so as to reach the active layer, deteriorating the light-emitting characteristics of the active layer and, as a result, degrading the reliability of the semiconductor laser device as another problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to suppress the diffusion of the dopants of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it is conceivable to set the growth temperature of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to around 700&deg; C. However, with growth temperatures around 700&deg; C., it would be impossible to achieve a growth of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to a thickness of 50 &mgr;m by slow cooling LPE process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a further problem that the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> formed by the slow cooling LPE process would result in a carrier concentration that decreases along a direction from lower end toward upper end as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. This is due to the fact that since the slow cooling LPE process causes the growth temperature to lower with an elapse of the growth time, the amount of dopant deposition onto the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> decreases with the lowering of the growth temperature. Particularly, at surface portions of the p-GaAs layer grown to form the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, carrier concentration decreases considerably as shown in a carrier distribution chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis represents the thicknesswise distance (&mgr;m) from the surface of the p-GaAs layer, and the vertical axis represents the carrier concentration (pcs/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). Accordingly, it has been the case that after the growth of p-GaAs, an upper end portion of the p-GaAs growth layer is removed, by which the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed. This would result in an increase in the manufacturing process of the semiconductor laser device, which has been a cause of increases in the labor and cost for the manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is yet further problem that in the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in which the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed by MOCVD process, since the surfaces of the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the cap layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, on which the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is to be grown, have depressions or projections as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>D, the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> formed on the surfaces having these depressions or projections by the MOCVD process is subject to occurrence of strain. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a result of observing by photoelastic approach the strain of the semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in which the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has been formed by MOCVD process, in an overlapped view. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the strain due to the formation of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on the depressed-and-projecting surfaces by MOCVD process has occurred to not only a widthwise central portion C of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> but also a widthwise central portion D of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The strain that has occurred to the widthwise central portion C of the contact layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the widthwise central portion D of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> would adversely affect the light-emitting region, which is widthwise central portion of the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, causing a deterioration in the light-emitting characteristics of the semiconductor laser device. This problem is further noticeable with high-output laser devices in which the ridge portion of the p-type clad layer is formed relatively large in height. This is because large height of the ridge portion would increase the depressions and projections of the surfaces of the cap layer and the current constriction layer, which are to be formed on this ridge portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case where the groove of the current constriction layer is filled with part of the upper-side second clad layer by the slow cooling LPE process, there is a disadvantage as described below. That is, in the slow cooling LPE process, depending on the magnitude of supersaturation &Dgr;t of the LPE growth solution, the state in which part of the contact layer is filled into the groove of the current constriction layer varies as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C, reference numeral <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> denotes a current constriction layer, and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> denotes an upper-side second clad layer. The terms, supersaturation &Dgr;t of the LPE growth solution, refer to a difference between a saturation temperature at the time when p-type dopants such as GaAs, Al or Mg as a solute are melted into, for example, Ga as a solvent, and a supersaturation temperature at the time when the growth is started on the wafer with the temperature lowered from the saturation temperature. Preferably, the upper-side second clad layer <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is formed so as to form a planar surface on the groove of the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. However, the slow cooling LPE process is liable to variations in supersaturation &Dgr;t of the LPE growth solution at the plane of the wafer. As a result, growth defects would occur partly within the wafer plane according to the variations in supersaturation &Dgr;t as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor laser device which is generally uniform in carrier concentration of the clad layer, almost free from strain, and less demanding for time and labor in its manufacturing, and which has stable characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a semiconductor laser device which comprises, on a semiconductor substrate, a first clad layer, an active layer, a second clad layer having a ridge portion, a current constriction layer positioned on the second clad layer and on both sides of the ridge portion, and a contact layer, where the contact layer is formed by vapor phase epitaxial process, the semiconductor laser device further comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> a strain-occurrence preventing structure for preventing any strain from occurring in the contact layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of the above constitution, since occurrence of strain in the contact layer is prevented by the strain-occurrence preventing structure, deteriorations in the light-emitting characteristics of the semiconductor laser device due to strain of the contact layer, as would occur in the prior art, can be prevented so that a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the strain-occurrence preventing structure is a flattening layer formed between the current constriction layer as well as the ridge portion of the second clad layer, and the contact layer, by liquid phase epitaxial process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of this embodiment, since the flattening layer formed by liquid phase epitaxial process is provided between the current constriction layer plus the ridge portion of the second clad layer and the contact layer, the flattening layer having its surface formed planar by liquid phase epitaxial process, the contact layer formed on this planar surface can be made almost free from strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the ridge portion of the second clad layer has a height of 1.2 &mgr;m or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of this embodiment, even though the ridge portion of the second clad layer has a height of 1.2 &mgr;m or more, a contact layer free from strain can be obtained by virtue of the provision of the strain-occurrence preventing structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the flattening layer is formed by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of this embodiment, since the flattening layer serving as the strain-occurrence preventing structure is formed by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process, the surface of the flattening layer is formed planar effectively. As a result, the contact layer can be prevented from strain effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a semiconductor laser device, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> forming a first clad layer, an active layer, a second clad layer one on another on a semiconductor substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> forming a ridge portion in the second clad layer; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> forming a flattening layer on the ridge portion of the second clad layer and on the current constriction layer by liquid phase epitaxial process; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> forming a contact layer on the flattening layer by vapor phase epitaxial process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device manufacturing method of this constitution, on the semiconductor substrate, the first clad layer, the active layer and the second clad layer are formed, the ridge portion is formed in this second clad layer, and the current constriction layer is formed on the second clad layer and on both sides of the ridge portion. The flattening layer is formed on the ridge portion of the second clad layer and on the current constriction layer by liquid phase epitaxial process. On this flattening layer, the contact layer is grown by vapor phase epitaxial process. Thus, with the manufacturing method of this invention, the contact layer can be formed without causing strain. As a result, a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the flattening layer is formed at a temperature lower than any one of temperatures for forming the first clad layer, the active layer, the second clad layer and the current constriction layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device manufacturing method of this embodiment, since the flattening layer is formed at a temperature lower than any one of temperatures for forming the first clad layer, the active layer, the second clad layer and the current constriction layer, dopants with which the first clad layer and the second clad layer have been doped can be prevented from diffusing and reaching the active layer during the formation of the flattening layer. As a result, a semiconductor laser device having successful characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention provides a semiconductor laser device which comprises, on a semiconductor substrate, a first clad layer, an active layer, a lower-side second clad layer, a current constriction layer positioned on both sides of the lower-side second clad layer, an upper-side second clad layer positioned on the lower-side second clad layer and the current constriction layer, and a contact layer, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> the upper-side second clad layer is formed by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of this constitution, during the formation of the upper-side second clad layer by the temperature-difference LPE process, portions different in temperature to each other are formed on the lower-side second clad layer and on the current constriction layer, where a temperature difference in the planar direction is given, so that the growth state of crystals constituting the upper-side second clad layer can be controlled. Therefore, the crystals constituting the upper-side second clad layer are properly formed on the lower-side second clad layer between the current constriction layers. As a result, a disadvantage that growth defects of the upper-side second clad layer would occur due to variations in supersaturation &Dgr;t of growth solutions, as in the conventional case using the slow cooling LPE process, can be avoided. Besides, the surface of the upper-side second clad layer can be formed planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention of this constitution is now described in more detail. For example, for the processes of filling the clad layer into the striped groove formed in the current constriction layer to obtain planar-formed portions in the surface of the clad layer above the striped groove, it is advantageous in terms of manufacturing cost to employ liquid phase epitaxial process according to growth conditions (supersaturation &Dgr;t for slow cooling LPE). Among some types of liquid phase epitaxial process, adopting temperature-difference LPE process reduces partial growth defects within the wafer surface due to variations in supersaturation &Dgr;t in solutions, as would be involved in the slow cooling LPE process. The reason of this is as follows. That is, in the temperature-difference LPE process, for example, a solution using Ga as a solvent is given a temperature difference between upper part and lower part, and GaAs, which is the solute of the solution and the material crystals of the clad layer, is placed at the upper part (high-temperature side) of the solution while the wafer is placed at the lower part (low-temperature side) of the solution. As a result of this, the crystal material diffuses into the solution, and the diffused crystal material is epitaxially grown on the wafer. Just under the wafer is given a flow of a cooling medium such as gas so that heat absorption is implemented on the low-temperature side (wafer side), by which a temperature difference in the solution is given effectively. In this connection, the growth state of the crystal material on the wafer varies depending on the temperature difference in the solution. Therefore, the part just under the wafer is segmented, and the cooling medium to be put into flow is made controllable in amount on the basis of the resulting sections, so that the temperature difference in the solution with which the wafer is to make contact can be varied within the wafer surface. As a consequence, the crystal growth state at the striped groove part of the wafer can be made different from the other part, thus it becoming possible to properly control the state in which the crystals are filled into the striped groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the contact layer has a thickness of not less than 10 &mgr;m and not more than 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device of this embodiment, by virtue of the contact layer having a thickness of not less than 10 &mgr;m, a semiconductor laser device having a relatively large strength can be obtained. Besides, by virtue of the contact layer having a thickness of not more than 60 &mgr;m, in the case where the semiconductor laser device is used as a light source in an optical pickup of an optical disk system as an example, the return beam derived from the optical disk does not come incident on the end faces of the semiconductor laser device so that the return beam can be prevented from being applied again to the optical disk. Thus, an optical pickup having relatively successful S/N ratios of read signals can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a semiconductor laser device, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> forming a first clad layer, an active layer, a lower-side second clad layer and a current constriction layer on a semiconductor substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> forming a striped groove in the current constriction layer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> forming an upper-side second clad layer on the lower-side second clad layer and on the current constriction layer by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> forming a contact layer on the upper-side second clad layer by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With the semiconductor laser device manufacturing method of this constitution, on the semiconductor substrate, the first clad layer, the active layer, the lower-side second clad layer and the current constriction layer are formed, and the striped groove is formed in this current constriction layer. The upper-side second clad layer is formed on the current constriction layer so as to form a generally planar surface by temperature-difference LPE process in such a manner that the striped groove is filled. On this upper-side second clad layer, the contact layer is formed by temperature-difference LPE process. Accordingly, it is no longer necessary to eliminate upper end portions of growth layers in the process of forming the contact layer, which would be involved in the prior art, so that manufacturing labor and cost for the semiconductor laser device can be reduced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, the present invention is described in detail by way of embodiments thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing a semiconductor laser device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. This semiconductor laser device has, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a semiconductor substrate, an n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a first clad layer made of n-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As, an active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> made of non-doped Al<highlight><subscript>0.1</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.9</subscript></highlight>As, a p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a second clad layer made of p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As and having a ridge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> placed on the ridge portion and made of p-GaAs, a current constriction layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> positioned on widthwise both sides of the ridge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and on the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and made of n-GaAs, a flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed on the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and made of p-GaAs, and a p-GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed on the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The ridge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a height of about 1.2 &mgr;m, the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a thickness of 0.5 to 1.0 &mgr;m, and the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m. The thickness from the lower end of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the thickness from the upper end of the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are made generally equal to each other and smaller than 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This semiconductor laser device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is manufactured in the following processes. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are stacked one on another by MOCVD process as a chemical vapor phase deposition process at a temperature of 700-750&deg; C. Then, a striped resist mask not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is formed by photolithography on top of the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, widthwise both side portions of the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as well as widthwise both side specified-depth portions of the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are removed by etching with ammonia-base and sulfuric-acid-base etchants to form a ridge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, with the resist mask removed, an n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is grown on the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by MOCVD process (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). With the resist mask <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> placed on widthwise both sides of the protruding portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed at a widthwise center of the n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>), the protruding portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the n-GaAs layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is removed by etching. Thereafter, the resist mask <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is removed to form current constriction layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> on widthwise both sides of the ridge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this process, as a result of etching, depressions and projections occur to the surface of the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and part of the surface of the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. Therefore, p-GaAs is grown to a thickness of 0.5 to 1.0 &mgr;m on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by slow cooling LPE (Liquid Phase Epitaxial) process to form a flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a planar surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference>). In the process of forming this flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, since the growth thickness of p-GaAs is 0.5 to 1.0 &mgr;m, i.e. relatively thin, the temperature at which the slow cooling LPE process is carried out may be 700&deg; C. or lower. On the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed with its surface planar, p-GaAs is grown to about 50 &mgr;m by MOCVD process to form a contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Thus, the semiconductor laser device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is obtained. The growth of p-GaAs for the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the MOCVD process is carried out at a temperature of about 650&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor laser device manufactured in this way, since the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a planar surface, there occurs no strain in spite of the fact that the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by MOCVD process. As a result, strain in the contact layer and the substrate due to the formation of the contact layer by MOCVD process on a surface having depressions and projections as in the prior art can be prevented effectively, so that a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed at a temperature of 700&deg; C. or lower and the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed at a temperature of about 650&deg; C., where these temperatures are lower than the temperature of 700 to 750&deg; C. for the formation of the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, during the process of forming the flattening layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it never occurs that the dopants of the n-type clad layer and the p-type clad layer diffuse so as to reach the active layer as would occur in the prior art. Therefore, the semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be obtained stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Also, in the semiconductor laser device, the thickness from the lower end of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the thickness from the upper end of the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are made generally equal to each other and smaller than 60 &mgr;m. Accordingly, in this semiconductor laser device, when it is used as a light source of an optical pickup, a return beam having returned to the semiconductor laser device from the optical disk does not come incident on the end face. As a result, the return beam is reflected by the end face of the semiconductor laser device to reach again the optical disk, so that decreases in the S/N ratio of signals to be read by the optical pickup can be prevented effectively. Besides, since the contact layer of this semiconductor laser device is 10 &mgr;m or more thick, the semiconductor laser device can be made relatively large in strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The current constriction layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is made of n-GaAs in this embodiment, may also be formed of n-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is formed by MOCVD process in this embodiment, may also be formed by temperature-difference LPE process. In this case, the contact layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may appropriately be formed so that the temperatures at the n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the active layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the cap layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> become lower than 700 to 750&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view showing a semiconductor laser device according to a second embodiment of the invention. This semiconductor laser device has, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as a semiconductor substrate, an n-type buffer layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as a first clad layer made of n-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As, an active layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> made of Al<highlight><subscript>0.13</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.87</subscript></highlight>As, and a lower-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> as a lower-side second clad layer made of p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As, in this order, where a current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> made of n-GaAs is formed on widthwise both sides on the lower-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. On this current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and on the lower-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, an upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as an upper-side second clad layer made of p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As is formed, and a contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> made of p-GaAs is formed thereon. Electrodes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> made of Au&mdash;Ge are provided on the lower side face of the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and on the upper side face of the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> This semiconductor laser device is manufactured in the following processes. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, on an n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a 0.5 &mgr;m thick n-type buffer layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a 1.0 &mgr;m thick n-type clad layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a 0.08 &mgr;m thick active layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a 0.35 &mgr;m thick lower-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and a 1.0 &mgr;m thick current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are grown one on another by MOCVD process. Subsequently, a widthwise center of the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is removed by etching to form a striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is set to a width of 4 &mgr;m at the upper side face (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) . Subsequently, the striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is filled with p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As by temperature-difference LPE process, and further p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As is stacked on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to form an upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is made to have a thickness of 1.0 &mgr;m on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, a contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is formed by temperature-difference LPE process (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>). Finally, a p-electrode <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an n-electrode <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of, for example, Au&mdash;Ge, AuZn or the like are formed on the upper side face of the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the lower side face of the n-GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Thus, the semiconductor laser device is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C are views showing the processes in which the p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are formed by the temperature-difference LPE process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing equipment with which the temperature-difference LPE process is performed. In this equipment, a core tube <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which is made of quartz and which allows reducing hydrogen to flow internally is disposed inside a cylindrical heater <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In this core tube <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are accommodated a substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> made of graphite and a slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> attached to this substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so as to be slidable in the axial direction. Between the heater <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the core tube <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and below the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a plurality of cooling tube <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, . . . which allow a cooling medium to flow along the axis of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are disposed so as to be circumferentially arrayed.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, first, the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the layers up to the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> stacked thereon and with the striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> made therein as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is set to a recess <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Also, a clad-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a contact-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> are set to two recesses <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, respectively, and material crystals <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are set to the clad-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the contact-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, respectively. Specified doping elements have been added to the clad-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the contact-layer growth solution <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this state, the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are heated for a specified time by the heater <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, by which solutions of uniform liquid composition are generated in the recesses <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is moved axially with an operating rod <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> connected to the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> so that the recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is positioned onto the recess <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> accommodated therein, where the solution in the recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is kept in contact on the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for a specified time. In this way, p-Al<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>As is epitaxially grown within the striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the lower-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and on the current constriction layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, by which the upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is formed. Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is further moved axially with the operating rod <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> so that the recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is positioned onto the recess <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, where the solution in the recess <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is kept in contact on the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for a specified time. In this way, p-GaAs is epitaxially grown on the upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, by which the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is formed. Thereafter, the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is further moved axially so as to be removed from on the recess <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> formed therein is taken out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With the use of the temperature-difference LPE process, a temperature difference is generated between the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, so that the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in the recess <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is kept lower in temperature than the solutions in the recesses <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the slide board <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, thus allowing epitaxial growth to be implemented on the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by virtue of the temperature difference. Accordingly, unlike the slow cooling LPE process, in which epitaxial growth is implemented by lowering the temperature of the substrate and the solutions after contact of the solutions with the substrate, there occur no decreases in the amount of dopant deposition along the direction of growth of the growth layers due to temperature decreases. As a result, the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> grown by the temperature-difference LPE process can be made generally uniform in the amount of dopant deposition thicknesswise, so that a carrier concentration uniform in the thicknesswise direction can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a chart showing thicknesswise carrier distribution of the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> formed by the temperature-difference LPE process. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis represents the thicknesswise distance (&mgr;m) from the upper end of the contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and the vertical axis represents the carrier concentration (pcs/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, this contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> shows almost no changes in carrier concentration along the thicknesswise direction, hence a generally uniform carrier concentration. Accordingly, it is no longer necessary to eliminate an upper end portion of a growth layer in the process of forming the contact layer, which would be involved in the prior art, so that manufacturing labor and cost for the semiconductor laser device can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with the temperature-difference LPE process, since the temperature difference control can be implemented not only in the lengthwise direction of the substrate supporting base <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> but also in the widthwise position thereof, the temperature difference can be changed within the wafer surface during the process of forming the upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. That is, the crystal-filled state into the striped groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be controlled within the wafer surface. As a result, growth defects at the groove part, which would often occur with the slow cooling LPE process, can be avoided, so that an upper-side p-type clad layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> almost free from depressions and projections at the surface can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The contact layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment may be formed to any thickness within a range of 10 to 60 &mgr;m. In short, the requirement is only that the thickness from the active layer to the lower surface of the substrate and the thickness from the active layer to the upper surface of the contact layer are made generally equal to each other, where the active layer is positioned at a thicknesswise generally center of the semiconductor laser device. As a result, when this semiconductor laser device is used as a light source of an optical pickup, incidence of the return beam from the optical disk to the semiconductor laser device can be reduced effectively. Thus, the S/N ratio of signals to be read by the optical pickup can be improved effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the foregoing description, according to a semiconductor laser device of the present invention, the semiconductor laser device comprises, on a semiconductor substrate, a first clad layer, an active layer, a second clad layer having a ridge portion, a current constriction layer positioned on the second clad layer and on both sides of the ridge portion, and a contact layer, where the contact layer is formed by vapor phase epitaxial process, the semiconductor laser device further comprising a strain-occurrence preventing structure for preventing any strain from occurring in the contact layer. Thus, since occurrence of strain in the contact layer is prevented, deteriorations in the light-emitting characteristics of the semiconductor laser device due to strain of the contact layer, as would occur in the prior art, can be prevented so that a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> According to a semiconductor laser device manufacturing method of the invention, the semiconductor laser device manufacturing method comprises the steps of: forming a first clad layer, an active layer, a second clad layer one on another on a semiconductor substrate; forming a ridge portion in the second clad layer; forming a current constriction layer on the second clad layer and on both sides of the ridge portion; forming a flattening layer on the ridge portion of the second clad layer and on the current constriction layer by LPE process; and forming a contact layer on the flattening layer by vapor phase epitaxial process. Therefore, the contact layer can be formed without causing strain. As a result, a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> According to a semiconductor laser device of the invention, the semiconductor laser device comprises, on a semiconductor substrate, a first clad layer, an active layer, a lower-side second clad layer, current constriction layers positioned on both sides of the lower-side second clad layer, an upper-side second clad layer positioned on the lower-side second clad layer and the current constriction layer, and a contact layer, wherein the upper-side second clad layer is formed by temperature-difference LPE process. Since this temperature-difference LPE process is capable of controlling the growth temperature so that temperatures at the surfaces of the lower-side second clad layer and the current constriction layer are made different from each other, crystals constituting the upper-side second clad layer can be properly grown and filled therein by properly controlling the growth temperature for the part between the current constriction layers. As a result, crystal growth defects or the like between the current constriction layers can be prevented effectively, so that the yield of the semiconductor laser device can be improved effectively and moreover that a semiconductor laser device having successful characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to a semiconductor laser device manufacturing method of the invention, the semiconductor laser device manufacturing method comprises the steps of: forming a first clad layer, an active layer, a lower-side second clad layer and a current constriction layer on a semiconductor substrate; forming a striped groove in the current constriction layer; forming an upper-side second clad layer on the lower-side second clad layer and on the current constriction layer by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process; and forming a contact layer on the upper-side second clad layer by temperature-difference liquid phase epitaxial process. Therefore, the upper-side second clad layer can be formed by the striped groove being filled without causing depressions and projections on the striped groove of the current constriction layer, and moreover the carrier concentration of the contact layer can be formed generally uniform in the thicknesswise direction. Thus, a semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be obtained stably. Besides, since the upper-side second clad layer is formed by temperature-difference LPE process, crystal growth defects within the striped groove of the current constriction layer can be prevented effectively. As a result, the semiconductor laser device having successful light-emitting characteristics can be manufactured with a successful yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
