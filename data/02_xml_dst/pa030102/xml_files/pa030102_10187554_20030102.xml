<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the technical field of identification or verification of biometric features, and more specifically to a device and a method for improving the reliability and accuracy of identification or verification through a person&apos;s biometric features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A trend is emerging where more and more organizations, such as customs inspection office, finance company and security establishment, resort to establishing a person&apos;s identity through his biometric features. This is achieved by recording his biometric data in a chip card such as an identification card or a credit card. And when this person is submitted to be identified or verified, his biometric features are firstly physically captured, and then compared with the pre-recorded biometric data to detect if they are identical. Some biometric features of a person, such as fingerprint, are unique, so this person will be positively identified or verified. As a result, the risk of the fraud is reduced. There are different types of biometric features adopted in identification system, for example, fingerprint, hand geometry, voice and iris etc. However, the problem in the known identification or verification process is that the risk of fraud still exists because the biometric data are electrically stored and can be forged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The most common and reliable biometric feature identification method is the fingerprint identification method. A wide range of Automated Finger Identification Systems(AFIS) are available in the market to satisfy the requirements of different customers. However, in the more sophisticated forgery or impersonation cases, the imposter would use the replica of the genuine card holder&apos;s fingerprint or might even resort to user a severed finger to go through the automated identification or verification process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problem, specialized hardware devices have been developed to detect the above forgeries. One way to detect whether the finger is live or dead is to measure the temperature or pulse of the person under verification by using a specialized hardware device. However, the cost of the AFIS increases because of the additional hardware, and the verification result may not always be reliable due to many factors, such as the environment condition in which the identification or verification process is carried out. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> according to the invention may be installed in an existing automated biometric identification system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in the form of a software function module, without increasing any hardware overhead. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the biometric data inputting means <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be any apparatus in the form of software and/or hardware for capturing biometric data of a person to be identified or verified, such as an optical scanner.The automated biometric identification system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives a first set of biometric data captured by the inputting means <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, matches the captured data with the pre-stored biometric data of the registered card holder based on certain matching algorithm, and outputs the identification result. In parallel, the device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> according to the invention receives the biometric data from the inputting means <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and extracts a second set of biometric data from the data received, the second set of biometric data being different from the first set of biometric data and determines whether the first set of biometric features is genuine and derived from a live source. The process of the device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> will be described later. The output means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> sends out the identification results of the automated biometric identification system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Persons skilled in this field understand that the results may be output in the form of voice, image, literal character or their combination. The device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may specially comprise an alarm means <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which sends out alert message when the device detects falsified or dead biometric features of the person submitted for verification. Alternatively, the alarm means <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can be combined into the output means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, or the output means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may implement the function of the alarm means <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example embodying the concept of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this example, the concept of the invention is illustrated by reference to an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the ordinary AFIS, the image or data of the fingerprint of the person undergoing identification or verification process are input through a hardware (e.g., an optical scanner). Then the input image or data of the fingerprint will be compared with the pre-stored biometric data to make the identification. However, as explained in the background section, the more sophisticated forger can circumvent the identification or verification process by putting on a latex replica of the fingerprint or a severed finger of the genuine card holder. That is to say, the recognition result of the ordinary AFIS is not reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the reliability of the verification result of biometric data by the AFIS will be improved by adding the device for enhancing verification of biometric features according to the invention to the AFIS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical scanner <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> captures the biometric data of the fingerprint of the person undergoing the identification or verification process. The AFIS <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> extracts the fingerprint data from the biometric data of the finger input through the optical scanner <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the fingerprint data are treated as the first set of biometric data. And then the AFIS <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> matches the first set of biometric data with the pre-stored biometric data of the genuine card holder according to a certain designed matching algorithm, and outputs the identification or verification result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> according to the invention also receives the biometric data of the finger inputted by the optical scanner <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and extracts a second set of the biometric data from the data received, the second set of the biometric data being, for example, the sweat gland/pore distribution data. And then the device <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> determines whether the second set of the biometric data is derived from a live source by checking, for example, if there is the sweat gland/pore distribution data, or the sweat gland/pore distribution data extracted has the characteristics of a live finger. And an alarm message will be sent out from the alarm means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> if there is no sweat gland/pore distribution data or the sweat gland/pore distribution data are abnormal. It is understandable for the persons skilled in this field that the alarm means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> may be any mechanism which can send out different alarm message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the flow chart of the method for enhancing verification of biometric features according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> according to the invention receives the biometric data DATA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Then, at step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> extracts biometric data DATA2 from the DATA, which are different from the biometric data DATA1 processed by the AFIS <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the device detects if there are DATA2;and if yes, proceed to step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, if no, proceed to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> determines if DATA 2 are biometric data derived from a live source. And if yes, the process ends, if no, proceed to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an alarm message is sent out by the alarm means <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> according to the invention and its process have been described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The method according to the invention can be applied to automated biometric identification systems and the device for enhancing verification of biometric features <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> according to the invention can be incorporated into automated identification system as a hardware independent and &ldquo;open standard&rdquo; software, in particular, the AFIS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the sweat gland/pore distribution data are used as the second set of the biometric data in the embodiments. However, it is not limited to the sweat gland/pore distribution data so far as the second set of the biometric data has the characteristics of a live source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described in details by reference to the embodiments and the drawings, which, however, are not used to limit the invention. And the invention can be modified and improved without departing from the spirit and the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
