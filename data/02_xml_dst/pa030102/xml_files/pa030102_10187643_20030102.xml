<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to chemical mechanical polishing of substrates, and more particularly to an article and method for polishing a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuits are typically formed on substrates, particularly silicon wafers, by the sequential deposition of conductive, semiconductive or insulative layers. After each layer is deposited, it is etched to create circuitry features. As a series of layers are sequentially deposited and etched, the outer or uppermost surface of the substrate, i.e., the exposed surface of the substrate, becomes increasingly nonplanar. This nonplanar surface presents problems in the photolithographic steps of the integrated circuit fabrication process. Therefore, there is a need to periodically planarize the substrate surface to provide a planar surface. Planarization, in effect, polishes away a non-planar, outer surface, whether a conductive, semiconductive, or insulative layer, to form a relatively flat, smooth surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chemical mechanical polishing is one accepted method of planarization. This planarization method typically requires that the substrate be mounted on a carrier or polishing head with the exposed surface of the substrate placed against a rotating polishing pad or moving polishing belt (both of which will be referred to herein as polishing pads). The polishing pad may be either a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; pad or a fixed-abrasive pad. A conventional standard pad is formed of a durable material, whereas a fixed-abrasive pad has abrasive particles held in a containment media. The carrier head provides a controllable load, i.e., pressure, on the substrate to push it against the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A polishing slurry, including at least one chemically-reactive agent (e.g., deionized water for oxide polishing), and abrasive particles (e.g., silicon dioxide for oxide polishing) if a standard pad is used, is supplied to the surface of the polishing pad. The slurry can also contain a chemically reactive catalyzer (e.g., potassium hydroxide for oxide polishing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One conventional polishing pad, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,578,362 and 5,900,164, is a hard composite material with a roughened polishing surface. This polishing pad is composed of solid cast block of durable urethane mixed with fillers, such as hollow microcapsules, which provide the polishing pad with a microporous texture. The polishing pad has a low compressibility, is plastically deformable, and has a relatively low tensile modulus. This polishing pad is available from Rodel, Inc., located in Newark, Del., under the trade name IC-1000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another conventional polishing pad, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,728,552 and 4,927,432 is a soft composite material with a compliant polishing surface. This polishing pad is composed of a dense net or mesh of polyester fibers, such as Dacron&trade;, oriented substantially perpendicular to the polishing surface of the pad and leached or impregnated with urethane. The urethane fills a significant fraction of the void space between the fibers. The resulting pad is relatively compressible, is plastically and elastically deformable, and has a relatively low tensile modulus. This polishing pad is available from Rodel, Inc., under the trade name Suba-IV </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A two-layer polishing pad, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,257,478, has an upper layer composed of IC-1000 and a lower layer composed of SUBA-IV. The polishing pad may be attached to a rotatable platen by a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another conventional polishing pad, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,680, is soft poromeric material with a compliant polishing surface. This polishing pad is composed of a urethane with tubular void structures oriented perpendicularly to the polishing surface to provide the polishing pad with a spongelike texture. The resulting pad is relatively soft, and has a relatively low elastic modulus. This type of polishing pad is available from Rodel, Inc., under the trade name Polytex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A conventional fixed abrasive polishing pad includes discrete islands or blocks of polishing material formed on a multilayer sheet. The islands of polishing material are composed solid blocks of resin in which abrasive particles, such as silicon, aluminum or cerium particles, are dispersed. The resulting pad, although flexible, is relatively non-compressible and inelastic. As a substrate is polished, the resin is worn away to continuously expose additional abrasive particles. Fixed abrasive polishing pads are available from 3M, Inc., located in Minneapolis, Minn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The effectiveness of a CMP process may be measured by its polishing rate and by the resulting finish (roughness) and flatness (lack of large-scale topography) of the substrate surface. Inadequate flatness and finish can produce device defects. The polishing rate sets the time needed to polish a layer and the maximum throughput of the polishing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One limitation on polishing throughput, particularly when IC-1000 is used as the polishing material, is &ldquo;glazing&rdquo; of the polishing pad surface. Glazing occurs when the polishing pad is frictionally heated, shear stressed, and compressed in regions where the substrate is pressed against it. The peaks of the polishing pad are pressed down and the pits of the polishing pad are filled up, so the surface of the polishing pad becomes smoother and less able to transport slurry. As a result, the polishing time required to polish a substrate increases. Therefore, the polishing pad surface must be periodically returned to an abrasive condition, or &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo;, to maintain a high throughput. The conditioning process is destructive and reduces the lifetime of the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another limitation on throughput is the lifetime of the polishing pad. If a polishing pad wears out, it needs to be replaced. This requires that the polishing machine be shut down temporarily while a new polishing pad is affixed to the platen. The typical lifetime of an IC-1000 polishing pad is about 400-800 wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An additional consideration in the production of integrated circuits is process and product stability. To achieve a low defect rate, each substrate should be polished under similar conditions. However, the mechanical properties of a set of polishing pads can vary from pad to pad. In addition, changes in the process environment during polishing, such as temperature, pH, and the like, can alter or degrade the polishing pad, thereby leading to variations in the mechanical properties of the pad from substrate to substrate. This variability may lead to substrate surface variability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another consideration about conventional polishing pads is effective slurry transport. Some polishing pads, particularly pads with a solid non-porous polishing surface, such as the IC-1000, do not effectively or uniformly transport slurry. A result of ineffective slurry transport is non-uniform polishing. Grooves or perforations may be formed in a polishing pad to improve slurry transport. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention is directed to a carrier head that has a substrate receiving surface and a retaining ring surrounding the substrate receiving surface. The retaining ring includes a mesh of fibers and a binder material holding the fibers in the mesh. The binder material is coalesced among the fibers to leave pores in the interstices between the fibers of the mesh. The fibers and binder material provide a surface of the retaining ring with a brittle structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the carrier head may include one or more of the following features. The fibers may include cellulose, e.g., linen, or a polyamide, e.g., Aramid. The binder may include a resin, e.g., a phenolic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus with a polishing pad and a carrier head that includes a retaining ring surrounding a substrate receiving surface. The polishing pad includes a first mesh that has fibers and a binder material to hold the fibers in the first mesh, and the retaining ring includes a second mesh with the fibers and the binder material to hold the fibers in the second mesh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the carrier head may include one or more of the following features. In the first and second mesh, the binder material may be coalesced among the fibers to leave pores in the interstices between the fibers. The fibers and the binder material may provide the first and second mesh with a brittle structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a retaining ring that has a mesh of fibers and a binder material holding the fibers in the mesh. The binder material coalesced among the fibers to leave pores in the interstices between the fibers of the mesh. The fibers and binder material provide a surface of the retaining ring with a brittle structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus. The apparatus has a polishing pad, a carrier head to hold a substrate in contact with the polishing pad, a port to dispense a polishing liquid onto the polishing pad, and a pad cleaner including a plurality of nozzles to direct jets of a cleaning fluid onto the polishing pad and a brush to agitate a surface of the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. The pad cleaner may include a plurality of vacuum ports to suction cleaning fluid away from the polishing pad. The brush may be a rotating cylindrical brush. The polishing pad may include a mesh that has fibers and a binder material to hold the fibers in the mesh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus with a polishing pad, a carrier head to hold a substrate in contact with the polishing pad, a port to dispense a polishing liquid onto the polishing pad, and a platen to support the polishing pad. The polishing pad has a mesh of cellulose fibers and a phenolic resin binding the fibers in the mesh, the resin coalesced around the fibers to leave pores in the interstices in the fiber mesh. The platen includes one or more channels through which a coolant flows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the invention may include one or more of the following. The polishing pad can be fabricated using techniques that are conventional in the automobile clutch and brake pad industry, and can have a low manufacturing cost. The polishing pad can have an intrinsically long lifetime, and may not need conditioning. This also permits the polishing apparatus to be constructed without a conditioner apparatus, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the polishing apparatus. If the polishing pad is conditioned, it can be conditioned with another piece of polishing pad rather than a diamond-coated disk, thus reducing the cost of the conditioning device. The polishing pad can provide uniform material properties as it is worn away, thus providing a uniform polishing rate throughout the lifetime of the pad. The polishing pad is unlikely to cause scratching of the substrate. The polishing pad can be wetable and can effectively transport slurry without grooves or perforations. The polishing pad can be mounted to a platen without a subpad. The polishing pad can be thermally stable over a wider range of temperatures than conventional pads, thereby improving polishing uniformity. The polishing pad can be formed with a roughness or surface friction sufficient to provide a satisfactory polishing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additional features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description including the drawings and the claims.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes three independently-operated polishing stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a substrate transfer station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a rotatable carousel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which choreographs the operation of four independently rotatable carrier heads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A description of a similar polishing apparatus may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,574, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each polishing station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a rotatable platen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that supports a polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in detail below, the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed of a fiber matrix held with a resin binder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In operation, a substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is loaded into a carrier head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the transfer station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The carousel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> then transfers the substrate through a series of one or more of the polishing stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and finally returns the polished substrate to the transfer station <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each carrier head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives and holds a substrate, and polishes it by pressing it against the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the platen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. During polishing, the carrier heads rotate and laterally or radially oscillate. In addition, a liquid is supplied to the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to assist the polishing process. The liquid can be a slurry that contains abrasives (e.g., colloidal silica or alumina), or an abrasive-free solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes two primary components: a network or mesh of randomly oriented intertwined fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> coalesced among the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to hold them in the mesh. The polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a rough surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that is placed in contact with the substrate during polishing. The polishing material can be used in a circular polishing pad attached to a rotatable platen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a water-resistant double-sided adhesive tape <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The polishing material can thus form a single-layer pad, i.e., a compressible subpad may not be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are composed of a material that is inert in the polishing process. The fibers can be generally brittle when leached with the binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and exposed to the shear forces in the polishing or conditioning environment. For example, the fibers can be formed of an organic material, such as cellulose, e.g., linen, cotton or wood, or a polymer material, such as a polyamide, e.g., Aramid&trade;. Aramid fibers, which are available from DuPont Corporation, of Newark, N.J., have at least 85% of the amide linkages attached directly between two aromatic rings. The fibers can be arranged in the mesh with random orientations, and need not be oriented preferentially along a particular axis. The fibers can vary in length between about 50 and 1000 microns, e.g., between 100 and 500 microns, and the cross-sectional diameters of the fibers may vary between about 5 and 50 microns, e.g., between 10 and 30 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is also composed of a material that is inert in the polishing process and is generally brittle when exposed to the shear forces in the polishing or conditioning environment. For example, the binder material can be a porous polymer resin, such as a phenolic resin or epoxy resin. The binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is coalesced among the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to bind the fibers into the mesh. However, the binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> sticks mainly to the fibers and does not form a solid block, thereby leaving fairly large voids or pores <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the spaces between the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Since both the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and binder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are fairly brittle, the resulting composite polishing pad has a fairly brittle surface texture when compared to conventional polishing pads. In short, the surface of the polishing pad is a rough, brittle mat of randomly oriented fibers. Since the pad is brittle, it has a relatively large tensile modulus and undergoes relatively little plastic deformation (in comparison to conventional non-fixed abrasive polishing pads such as the IC-1000 or Suba-IV). In addition, the composite polishing pad is friable, i.e., the surface has a tendency to crumble under frictional force, e.g., when exposed to the shear forces in the polishing or conditioning environment. It should be noted that the friability of the polishing pad may only occur on a microscopic level during polishing, i.e., it is not necessary that shedding from the pad be visually observed during polishing and conditioning. However, the friability of the polishing pad should be observable if the pad is scraped lightly with a razor blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the pad is brittle, the voids and binder material can provide the pad with a compressibility suitable for chemical mechanical polishing. Specifically, under an applied load, the voids can collapse to permit the pad to compress without breaking the linkages formed between the fibers by the binder material. This permits the polishing material to be elastically deformable during compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The specific polishing characteristics of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are determined by the composition and hardness of the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the quantity of fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the size and shape of the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the size and shape of the pores in the pad, and the manufacturing process. In a polishing pad with phenolic resin and cellulose fibers, the ratio of fibrous material to binder material can be about 1:1 to 2:1, e.g., about 1.5:1 by weight. About half of the volume of the polishing pad can be take by the voids <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In general, increased curing of the binder material during manufacturing can cause the pad to become more brittle, whereas decreased curing can cause the pad to become less brittle. In general, using few fibers and packing the fibers less densely would increase the surface friction of the polishing pad and increase the polishing rate. Conversely, packing the fibers more densely would decrease the surface friction of the polishing pad, thus reducing the polishing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If the surface friction of the polishing pad needs to be increased further, a small amount of an elastomer, such as a rubber, e.g., latex, can be added to the binder material. This can result in a polishing pad that is slightly &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; to provide a higher surface friction, while maintaining a pad that is sufficiently brittle under the lateral force from the substrate during polishing or conditioning. Other additives can include graphite to make the pad denser and more abrasive, and calcium celite (e.g., diatomaceous earth) to maintain the porosity of the fiber mesh. The additives can be soluble or insoluble in the binder material. Moreover, some additives can be integrated in the body of the fibers, rather than being dispersed in the binder material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Since the pad material is brittle and friable, the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and binder <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> &ldquo;shed&rdquo; easily. That is, under a lateral force, the fibers and binder material near the surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> break away from the body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the polishing pad. However, since the pad is compressible, the fibers will remain in the matrix and are not torn away from the body of the polishing pad under a compressive force. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passing over the surface of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during polishing will generate a downward force FD and a lateral force FL. The downward force FD will compress the region of the polishing pad directly below the substrate, although there may also be a rebound region. On the other hand, since the pad material is fairly brittle, the lateral force FL will tend to cause fragments <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the binder material <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to break away from the body of the polishing pad, thus shearing away a very thin upper layer of the pad. This action might occur either from breakage of individual fibers, or from breakage of the binder material that results in an entire fiber coming free from the pad, or from breakage of chemical bonds between fibers. However, as previously noted, the fragmentation of the polishing pad surface may only occur on a microscopic level, i.e., it is not necessary that shedding from the pad be visually observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Since the pad material is fairly homogenous and isotropic, with the fibers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> dispersed through the pad at a uniform density and with random orientations, the polishing pad can maintain uniform mechanical properties as the top surface of the polishing pad is worn away. Therefore, the polishing pad should exhibit uniform surface friction throughout its lifetime. This can provide more uniform polishing rates, both during polishing of a single wafer and across wafer lots. In addition, since the polishing pad material sheds, the pad refreshes itself, thereby potentially eliminating the need for conditioning. Furthermore, a polishing pad composed of cellulose fibers and a phenolic resin binder material creates a polishing pad that can be thermally stable, i.e., its mechanical properties do not change sufficiently to affect polishing, over a wider range of temperatures than conventional pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can formed using techniques generally known by manufacturers of automobile clutch and brake pads. In fact, a conventional automobile clutch or brake pad may be suitable for use in chemical mechanical polishing, thus providing a new use for a conventional structure. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the matrix of fibers is formed using a process similar to the Fourdrinier process. First, the fibers are prepared (step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). Cellulose fibers can be created by mechanically pulping linen, cotton, wood or the like. Aramid fibers are available from DuPont Corporation, of Newark, N.J. The fibers are mixed with a liquid, such as a solution of the binder material, e.g., a phenol, and a liquid in which the binder material is soluble, e.g., an alcohol, to form a liquid pulp (step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). The liquid pulp is then deposited on a screen or a continuous belt (step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). As the liquid dries and drains off, the solution evaporates and the binder cures or sets to form the relatively brittle resinous binder material, e.g., the phenolic resin (step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). The material may then be pressed to remove more liquid and create weak chemical bonding between the fibers (step <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the surface of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime; can be textured prior to and/or during engagement with the substrate surface. Specifically, grooves or perforations <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be formed in the top surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>&prime; of the polishing pad. In one implementation, the grooves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are concentric circles with a depth of about 0.02 inches, a width of about 0.10 inches and a pitch of about 0.25 inches. However, grooves and perforations may not be necessary, as slurry can be trapped in the pores <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the fiber mesh and transported by the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each polishing station of CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include a combined slurry/rinse arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that projects over the surface of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The slurry/rinse arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can include one or more slurry supply tubes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> connected to a slurry delivery system to provide a slurry <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the surface of the polishing pad. Typically, sufficient slurry is provided to wet the entire polishing pad. The slurry/rinse arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes several spray nozzles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to create high-pressure jets of a cleaning fluid, e.g., deionized water. The jets of cleaning fluid provide a high-pressure rinse of the polishing pad at the end of each polishing cycle in order to remove used slurry and polishing debris from the polishing pad. The slurry/rinse arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can also include several air nozzles <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that direct high-pressure jets of air into the polishing pad. These high-pressure jets purge the cleaning fluid from of the polishing pad and prevent dilution of the slurry during the next polishing cycle. Alternatively, the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be connected to both a cleaning fluid source and a pressurized air source in order to perform both the spray rinse and the air purge of the polishing pad, or to a vacuum source to suction cleaning fluid from the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, a pad washing apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; can be positioned over the polishing pad. The washing apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; can include several spray nozzles <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; that direct high-pressure jets of a cleaning fluid, e.g., deionized water, onto the polishing pad, several vacuum ports <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; connected to a vacuum source to suction the cleaning fluid from the polishing pad, and a rotating cylindrical bristle brush <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; to agitate the fibers of the polishing pad, much like a rug shampooer, so that the polishing pad is thoroughly cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, each station of the CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include a conditioning apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Each pad conditioner apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has an oscillating arm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that holds an independently rotating conditioner head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A similar conditioner apparatus is described in pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/052,798, filed Mar. 31, 1998, assigned to the assignee of the present application, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. If required, the conditioner apparatus maintains the condition of the polishing pad so that it will provide uniform polishing. Conditioning may also be needed for an initial break-in of the polishing pad. A circular sheet of polishing pad material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be secured to the underside of the conditioner head. In operation, the conditioner head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> rotates as the arm <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> oscillates to sweep the conditioner head across the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the conditioning material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> pressed against the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Thus, rather than an expensive diamond disk, the same material that performs the polishing can be used to condition the polishing pad. In general, conditioning of the brittle polishing pad could be performed by other devices in the polishing apparatus. For example, if a carrier head includes a retaining ring with grooves formed on the underside for slurry transport, the sharp edges of the grooves may act to condition the polishing pad and improve the polishing rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in another implementation of the invention, the polishing apparatus includes a carrier head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to hold the substrate in place against frictional forces from the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. At least the lower portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the retaining ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed of the same material as the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, e.g., a brittle and friable material formed from a network or mesh of randomly oriented intertwined fibers and a binder material coalesced among the fibers to hold them in the mesh. Thus, the lower surface of the retaining ring can condition the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one experiment, a &ldquo;light brown&rdquo; fibrous material, composed of paper or Aramid fibers in a resin was obtained from Raybestos Corp., of Crayfordsville, Ind. The material was cut into a 20-inch diameter pad with thickness of about 0.04 inches, and affixed to a platen of a MIRRA&reg; polishing machine with double-sided adhesive. No grooves were formed in the pad. The pad was rinsed with high-pressure water prior to polishing, and showed good wetability. One patterned wafer was polished with Rodel SS-12 slurry on a Titan Head&trade; wafer carrier using at a substrate pressure of 2 psi. The platen rotation rate was 93 rpm, and the carrier head rotation rate was 87 rpm. No conditioning was performed. The polishing pad successfully polished the substrate with a planarity (within-wafer non-uniformity) superior to that of a conventional IC-1000/Suba-IV pad stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In another experiment, a series of substrates were polished under the conditions described above. The substrates included both &ldquo;blank&rdquo; wafers with a layer of thermal oxide, and patterned wafers. Before polishing of a patterned wafer, the polishing rate was about 200-300 &angst;/min, whereas after polishing of a patterned wafer, the polishing rate rose to about 600-650 &angst;/min and remained relatively constant through 140 minutes of polishing. Without being limited to any particular theory, the patterned wafer may have abraded the top surface of the polishing pad so as to improve the polishing rate. The surface temperature of the polishing pad remained constant at about 85&deg; F. By implementing the air purge of water from the pad, a grooved retaining ring, and like-material pad conditioning, as described above, the polishing rate was increased to about 1200 &angst;/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Photographs of the polishing pad material used in the above experiments at magnifications of &times;40 and &times;200 are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In general, a material may be considered brittle if it undergoes little elongation (in comparison to conventional polishing pad materials), e.g., less than 5% elastic or plastic deformation, prior to breaking. For example, the polishing pad can have an elongation less than about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1%, prior to breaking. The polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can have a tensile modulus greater than 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>psi, e.g., greater than 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>psi, or greater than 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>psi, and a flexural modulus greater than 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>psi, e.g., greater than 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>psi. Another indication that a material is brittle is if the tensile point, i.e., the force or pressure at which the material breaks, does not differ significantly, e.g., less than 5% different for polishing pad materials, from the yield point, i.e., the force or pressure at which the material begins to deform. Thus, the polishing pad should have a yield point that is substantially the same as the tensile point. The difference between the yield and tensile point can be less than 5%, e.g., less than 1%. Tests of the elongation, yield point, tensile point and tensile modulus may be performed with the ASTM D638 test, and tests of the flexural modulus may be performed with the ASTM D790 test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The brittle polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used to polish metals such as copper, dielectrics (including oxides and nitrides) such as silicon oxide, and semiconductors such as silicon. The multiplaten architecture of CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> permits a wide variety of polishing processes to be performed using the brittle polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In a typical implementation, substrate may be polished with brittle polishing pads at the first two polishing stations, and then buffed with a conventional soft polishing pad at the final polishing station. Alternatively, the brittle polishing pad at the first platen may be followed by a conventional standard polishing pad or a fixed abrasive polishing pad at the second platen, or a conventional standard polishing pad or a fixed abrasive polishing pad at the first platen may be followed by a brittle polishing pad at the second platen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Another potential advantage of the brittle polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is that it can be more thermally conductive than conventional polishing pads. This can reduce the thermal gradient across the substrate, thereby improving the polishing uniformity. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> coolant, e.g., water, can flow through one or more channels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the platen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to maintain the platen and polishing pad at a constant temperature. Since the polishing pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> readily transports heat from the slurry and substrate, the reliability of the temperature control system for the polishing apparatus can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Several embodiments of the present invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.</paragraph>
