<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to surgical needle holders and more particularly to an improved needle holder providing a more stable platform on which to mount a needle during laparoscopy or microsurgery. The device further allows for simultaneous placement of multiple needles thereby reducing operating time and providing for more precise suture alignment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the tremendous increase in surgeons&apos; experiences on minimal invasive surgery performed laparoscopically and microsurgically, the safety and outcome of these newest forms of surgical treatment options have improved dramatically in recent years. At the same time, there has been an increase in the demand both from patients in receiving surgical care laparoscopically and microsurgically when indicated, and from surgeons in acquiring such surgical techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, laparscopic surgery has shifted from a resection-oriented phase to a reconstruction-oriented one, requiring anastomosis to be made to a variety of structures with conventional suture materials. The action of needle placement laparscopically is a technical challenge. The insertion and removal of the laparscopic instrument to and from the inflated peritoneum for mounting each needle is tedious and time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it has been clearly established in the current medical literature that micro-surgical reconstruction of the male reproductive tract with vasectomy or vasoepididymostomy in men with infertility due to obstruction is a more cost-effective management than the use of assisted reproductive technology. Currently, 500,000 men per year in the United States choose vasectomy as a means of permanent contraception. In part because of a high divorce rate, surveys estimate that 10,000 to 30,000 men per year seek vasectomy reversal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Berger (J. Urol. 1998, 159: 1951) described a &ldquo;triangulation&rdquo; technique which was evaluated as having superior results (J. Urol. 1999, 161 (Suppl): 93; J. Urol. 1999, 161 (Suppl): 350). This technique was later modified by Marmar (J. Urol. 2000, 163: 483) into a &ldquo;two-suture&rdquo; anastomosis this latter modification requires precise and simultaneous placement of two fine micro-needles and is technically difficult to perform even for experienced microsurgeons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a needle holder for precision placement and secure holding of one or more needles, thereby significantly reducing the operating time spent on remounting needles and, more importantly, making multi-suture placement more precise and easier. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a needle holding device including a handle, a pivot point and two opposing jaws opposite the handle and pivotable about the pivot point. The jaws have inner opposing surfaces and at least one inner opposing surfaces has at least one needle groove formed therein for receiving and gripping a needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the needle holding device is in the form of a scissors-type surgical clamp and at least one of the opposing surfaces has a knurled or rugged platform for securely gripping at least one needle. The needle holding device further preferably includes a biasing element, such as a spring, for urging the inner opposing surfaces together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The needle holding device may take the form of a parallel needle holder, wherein at least one of the opposing surfaces has a plurality of substantially parallel needle grooves formed therein for simultaneously receiving and gripping a plurality of needles. The plurality of parallel needle grooves may be spaced equidistant apart so that a variety of multiple needle spacings can be achieved. Additionally, the plurality of parallel needle grooves preferably includes an innermost needle groove disposed nearest to the pivot point and an outermost needle groove disposed furthest from the pivot point, wherein the plurality of needle grooves successively increase in depth from the outermost needle groove to the innermost needle groove so that a plurality of needles can be simultaneously held regardless of needle size or position within the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the needle holding device may take the form of an angled needle holder, wherein at least one of the opposing surface has a plurality of non-parallel needle grooves formed therein for simultaneously receiving and gripping a plurality of needles. The non-parallel needle grooves are preferably formed at known angles with respect to each other. Preferably, the non-parallel needle grooves are at a minimum of about 1&deg; with respect to each other and a maximum of about 90&deg; with respect to each other. Again, the plurality of non-parallel needle grooves preferably includes an innermost needle groove disposed nearest to the pivot point and an outermost needle groove disposed furthest from the pivot point, wherein the plurality of needle grooves successively increase in depth from the outermost needle groove to the innermost needle groove so that a plurality of needles can be simultaneously held regardless of needle size or position within the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the improved needle holder, as well as other features and advantages of this invention, will be apparent from the following detailed description, which is to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> parallel multi-needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is shown. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally similar to a conventional scissors-type surgical clamp comprising two opposing jaws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pivotable about a pivot point <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the jaws. At least one, and preferably both, of the inner opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the opposing jaws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are preferably formed having a rugged or knurled platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for securely holding a single needle or multiple needles. The rugged platform portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides for stronger grip and strength in needle placement than can be provided by traditional needle holders. Additionally, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further preferably includes a biasing element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for urging the inner opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> together. The biasing element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be a spring located near the handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for urging the opposing jaws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a normally closed position, wherein the inner opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may securely grip one or more needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, in the preferred embodiment, at least one, and preferably both, of the inner opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of both opposing jaws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed having at least one needle groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for receiving and gripping at least one needle. Thus, a single needle or multiple needles can be mounted directly on the rugged platform portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the jaws <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or can be mounted in one of the grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or any combination thereof. The combination of the rugged platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the needle groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides flexibility of use for the surgeon. The needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used as a regular needle holder for a single needle or, where multiple grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided, can be used with multiple needles. Thus, the additional needle groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides improved grip, as well as extra precision during needle placement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With traditional micro-needle holders, because of insecure needle grip, the micro-needles will often &ldquo;spring off&rdquo; from the needle holder. It is extremely time consuming, if not impossible, to look for the lost needle. The needle holder of the present invention provides for secure gripping and, therefore, the chance of accidental &ldquo;springing off&rdquo; is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with a plurality of needle grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which are substantially parallel to one another for allowing perfect parallel placement of multiple needles. In addition, the parallel grooves will secure the direction of the needles and prevent unintentional disturbance of the entrance angle during needle placement. Perfect parallel alignment of multiple needles will also provide equal anastomotic tension for tying sutures. As will be discussed in further detail below, the depth and spacing of the grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is predetermined to allow for a variety of needle sizes and spacings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of a multi-needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown. The multi-needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> is in the form of an angled needle holder. Again, the angled needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is similar to a conventional surgical clamp having opposing upper and lower jaws <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a handle (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>) for opening and closing the jaws. Similar to the needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above, at least one, and preferably both, of the opposing inner surfaces <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the jaws <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the angled needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed with a rugged or knurled platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and at least one needle groove <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. However, unlike the parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the angled needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of nonparallel needle grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed in the jaws <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at predetermined angles with respect to each other. The minimum angle between the nonparallel grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is about 1 degree, while the maximum angle between the nonparallel grooves is about almost 90 degrees. This allows for tangential needle entrance to the tissue plane during multiple needle placement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Like the parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the angled needle holding device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used in a conventional manner by simply positioning and gripping one or more needles between the upper and lower jaws <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The rugged platform <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, however, provides superior grip with the present invention. Alternatively, one or more needles can be positioned in the needle grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to provide extra precise positioning of the needle(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>the needle grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for both the parallel needle holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the angled needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are specially designed such that all of the grooves provide similarly secure grip to the needle regardless of how many needles are being held at one time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a parallel needle holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> holding four <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (100 &mgr;m) size needles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, one in each of four needle grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a parallel needle holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> holding four <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (70 &mgr;m) needles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, one in each of four needle grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. (For the angled needle holder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the needle grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> would typically be designed for needles of sizes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, each being held securely within the device regardless of size.) As can be seen in these Figures, each of the needles is securely held regardless of its size or which groove it is positioned. This can be accomplished by decreasing the depth of each successive groove from the innermost groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(i.e., closest to the device pivot point <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) to the outermost groove <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>showing the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fully closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, particularly for the parallel needle holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are spaced at predetermined distances so that a multitude of needle spacing configurations can be achieved. For example, if the spacing is equidistant, placing needles in grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will achieve a spacing of 1.0 unit. By placing needles in grooves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>a spacing of 2.0 units can be achieved and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> show use of a parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed in accordance with the present invention, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows use of an angled needle holding device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, both devices <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are ideal for double-suture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> placement. Additionally, both devices provide more secure grip to the distal needle than traditional needle holders. With the parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, two micro-needles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be placed simultaneously in parallel fashion. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when a small opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the tubular structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is desired, the parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the needles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are placed on the epididymal tubule perpendicularly, as done in a conventional double-suture vasoepididymostomy. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the parallel needle holding device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention allows for two micro-needles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be precisely placed simultaneously along the epididymal tubule in a longitudinal fashion. This allows a larger opening for anastomosis, thereby enhancing the post-operative patency rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows use of the angled needle holding device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention wherein the pre-designed angles between the grooves <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allow for tangential needle entrance to the tissue plane. Simultaneous placement of two needles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this manner will reduce the number of maneuvers, making the surgery easier especially for surgeons who perform such surgeries only occasionally. For experienced surgeons, it will significantly reduce the operating time while providing a more precise suture alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The needle holders of the present invention solve the tedious and time consuming problem of preciously mounting individual needles. The invention also allows placement of more than one needle, with a more secure grip and in a pre-set direction. The needle holders of the present invention will significantly reduce the operating time spent on remounting needles and, more importantly, will make multi-suture placement more precise and easier.
