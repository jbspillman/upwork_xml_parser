<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a resin composition for coating and more specifically relates to a resin composition for cationic electrodeposition paint capable of forming a coating film excellent in electrodeposition property, coating surface smoothness and anticorrosivity in spite of small content of organic solvent and without containing a lead compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electrodeposition paint is being used as undercoat paint for motorcar and for other wide range of application and products with various features have been developed hitherto. Particularly cationic electrodeposition paints, containing as base resin an epoxy resin containing an amino group as solubilizing group and an epoxy resin solubilized by a quaternary ammonium salt group etc., have been being widely used due to its excellent anticorrosivity, throwing power etc., replacing conventional anionic electrodeposition paints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These cationic electrodeposition paints are generally water-based paints, but usually an organic solvent is used together in order to secure the electrodeposition property and coating surface smoothness. Further, a lead compound is compounded in order to secure the anticorrosivity. Though an organic solvent plays an important role at the time of an electrodeposited film formation, it is desirable to reduce its amount to the utmost from the viewpoint of VOC (volatile organic compounds). Moreover, a lead compound is a very harmful substance and its usage is problematic in the counter-measures against public pollution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The main purpose of the present invention is to provide a resin composition for cationic electrodeposition paint without deflects as mentioned above and excellent in coating film properties such as anticorrosivity, coating surface smoothness etc. with low content of organic solvent and without containing a lead compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Means of Solving the Problems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have been conducting an intensive research in order to solve the problems a cationic electrodeposition paint has as mentioned above. As a result, this time, they have found out that the above-mentioned purpose could be achieved by using as base resin a resin obtained by reacting an epoxy resin, in which a prescribed amount of alkylene oxide has been introduced, with a cyclic ester and has completed the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a resin composition for coating comprising a modified epoxy-poly-amine resin (f), obtained by first reacting a diepoxide compound (a) selected from the group consisting of the compounds represented by the following general formulae (I) and (II)

In case of using a primary amine or a secondary amine having N-hydroxyalkyl group as the amine compound, however, it is generally desirable to prepare an objected modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) by reacting such an amine, after converting into an aldimine, ketimine, oxazoline or imidazoline by previously reacting, according to a usual process, with a ketone, aldehyde or carboxylic acid through heating to a temperature of, for example, about 100-about 230&deg; C., with the lactone-modified epoxy resin (e), for example, preferably in an organic solvent as aforementioned, at a temperature of about 80-about 200&deg; C., particularly about 80-about 120&deg; C. for some 1-5 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The application amount of the amine compound to the lactone-modified epoxy resin (e) in the above-mentioned reaction is not strictly limited but can be varied according to the kind of said lactone-modified epoxy resin or the properties required for the objected product, the modified epoxy-polyamine resin. Generally, however, there is desireble such an amount as to give an amine value in the range of 15-100, particularly 20-70 to the final product, the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f). There is observed such a tendency that if the amine value of the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) is smaller than 15, the water-dispersibility of said resin is lowered, and if it is bigger than 100, the water resistance of the coating film formed by using said resin is deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) prepared as mentoined above can contain the alkylene oxide or alkylene glycol structural units originated from the diepoxide compounds (a) of the aforementioned formulae (I) or (II) in the range of generally 3-40% by weight, preferably 5-20% by weight. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The partially blocked polyisocyanate compound (h) used in the above-mentioned embodiment has a blocking rate in the range of 20-80%, preferably 40-70% and such a partially blocked polyisocyanate compound can be obtained, for example, by reacting a polyisocyanate compound and an isocyanate blocking agent in such a proportion portion that the ratio of the number of isocyanate groups in the polyisocyanate compound/the number of active hydrogen in the isocyanate blocking agent would be in the range of 1/0.5-1/0.95, preferably 1/0.6-1/0.9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;blocking rate&rdquo; here means the ratio of the blocked isocyanate groups after the reaction to the number of total isocyanate groups in the polyisocyanate compound before the reaction, in case the isocyanate groups in the polyisocyanate compound are reacted with active hydrogen in the blocking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A polyisocyanate compound is a compound having at least two isocyanate groups in the molecule and as specific examples there are mentioned, for example, aliphatic and alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, hydrogenated diphenylmethane diisocyanate etc.; aromatic polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4&prime;-diisocyanate etc. and above all, isophorone diisocyanate and diphenylmethane-4,4&prime;-diisocyanate are preferred. They can be used singly or in combination of two kinds or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, an isocyanate blocking agent is an active hydrogen-containing compound having a function to temporarily add and block the isocyanate group in a polyisocyanate compound and the partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) formed by said addition can be a substance that is stable at normal temperature and capable of reproducing a free isocyanate group by dissociating a blocking agent when heated to about 140&deg; C.-about 250&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As a blocking agent meeting such requirements there are mentioned, for example, lactam type compounds such as &egr;-caprolactam, &ggr;-butyrolactam etc.; oxime type compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime, cyclohexanone oxime etc.; phenol type compounds such as phenol, p-t-butylphenol, cresol etc.; aliphatic alcohols such as n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol etc.; aromatic alkyl alcohols such as phenyl carbinol, methyl phenyl carbinol etc.; ether alcohol type compounds such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The reaction ratio of the above-mentioned partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) and the modified epoxy resin (e) can be in the range of generally 1/20-1/1, preferably 1/10-1/2.5 as solid content ratio of compound (h)/resin (e). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) and the modified epoxy resin (e) can be conducted, for example, by reacting these two components preferably in an organic solvent such as ketone type like methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone etc.; hydrocarbon type like xylene, toluene etc. at a temperature of about 50-about 120&deg; C. until no free isocyanate group is substantially detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a diepoxide compound (a) and bisphenol A type epoxy resin are reacted with a bisphenol (b) as aforementioned and the obtained epoxy resin (c) is reacted with a cyclic ester (d) into a lactone-modified epoxy resin (e), which is reacted with an amine compound having active hydrogen and the obtained modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) is further reacted with a partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) as mentioned above to obtain a urethane-modified epoxy-polyamine resin (g). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The reaction ratio of the partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) and the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) can be in the range of generally 1/20-1/1, preferably 1/10-1/2.5 as solid content ratio of compound (h)/resin (f). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) and the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) can be conducted, for example, under the similar conditions as aforementioned about the reaction of the partially blocked isocyanate compound (h) and the modified epoxy resin (e) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) and the urethane-modified epoxy-polyamine resin (g) obtained as mentioned above have advantages that they can be electrodeposition-coated without lowering the electrodeposition properties even under low organic solvent or without organic solvent, because they have a structure in which a plastic component alkylene oxide (or alkylene glycol) structural unit and a hard bisphenol structural unit are repeated at a relatively short interval in the molecule, and that they can form a coating film having sufficient anticorrosivity without compounding a lead compound, because they have highly active primary hydroxyl group originated from a cyclic ester in the side chain. Therefore the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) and the urethane-modified epoxy-polyamine resin (g) can be favorably used as a resin composition for coating, particularly a base resin component in a resin composition for cationic electrodeposition paint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In case of using the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) or the urethane-modified epoxy-polyamine resin (g) in a resin composition for coating, these resins can be used with an outer crosslinking agent together. As an outer crosslinking agent usable together there can be mentioned, compounds having at least two crosslinking functional groups (for example, blocked isocyanate group), which can react with a reactive functional group (for example, primary or secondary hydroxyl group) in the above-mentioned resins, in the molecule, for example, blocked polyisocyanate compounds, &bgr;-hydroxy-carbamic acid esters of polyamine, malonic acid ester derivatives, methylolized melamine, methylolized urea etc. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The resin composition according to the present invention comprising the modified epoxy-polyamine resin (f) or the urethane-modified epoxy-polyamine resin (g) can be favorably used for the preparation of a cationic electrodeposition coating bath as a resin for cationic electrodeposition paint. The preparation can be conducted by a per se known method, for example, by neutralizing such a resin, using a sitable acid, for example, an inorganic acid such as boric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid etc.; or an organic acid such as lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid etc. singly or in combination of two or more, dissolving or dispersing stably in water by adding water while sufficiently stirring and mixing, and then kneading, as necessary, color pigment such as carbon black, titanium white, iron oxide red etc.; extender pigment such as clay, talc etc.; anticorrosive pigment such as strontium chromate etc.; or further other additives. As other compoundable additives there are mentioned, for example, a small amount of nonionic surface-active agent as dispersant or cissing-preventing agent for the coating surface; curing accelerater (for example, salts of metals such as bismuth, tin, zinc, iron, aluminium etc. and/or imidazoline compounds, imidazoles, phosphines, quaternary phosphonium salts) etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A cured coating film having excellent coating film performances can be obtained by conducting an electrodeposition coating by a similar method in a usual cationic electrodeposition coating, using the cationic electrodeposition coating bath prepared as mentioned above and an electroconductive substrate as cathode, and after washing with water, by baking at a temperature of about 150-about 200&deg; C. for about 10 minutes-about 40 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thus the resin composition for coating provided by the present invention can be widely used, for example, in the field of undercoating of motorcar body, coating of industrial parts, electric appliances etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described hereinafter more specifically with Examples. &ldquo;Parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;%&rdquo; simply mentioned mean &ldquo;parts by weight&rdquo; and &ldquo;% by weight&rdquo; respectively.</paragraph>
