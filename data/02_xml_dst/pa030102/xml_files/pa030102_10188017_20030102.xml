<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a cosmetic carrier attachment for an electronics communications device, and more particularly, to a foldable cosmetic carrier case that can be attached to at least one of a cellular telephone or other type of device that is capable of communicating by sending messages via the internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Electronic communications devices such as cellular telephones and other electronic communications devices capable of communication by sending e-mails over the internet are now being carried on a daily basis by almost everyone. Attachments and accessories for these devices such as carrying cases, battery charges and the like are also being marketed to consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In that most individuals now carry such electronic communications devices as part of their daily routine, it would be advantageous to incorporate a means for carrying other items that are also part of an individual&apos;s daily routine along with their electronic communications device. The majority of female consumers typically carry one or more cosmetic products with them, particularly when they are on the go and outside of their homes. Since both electronic communications devices and cosmetic items are typically carried by female consumers as part of their daily routine when outside of their home, it would be advantageous to enable both types of items to be somehow connected to one another to enable a user to efficiently and compactly carry these items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a cosmetic carrier attachment for electronic communications devices which is compact and sleek in design so that it&apos;s attachment to such communications devices does not produce a bulky item that would be awkward and inconvenient to carry. There is also a need for a cosmetic carrier attachment for an electronic communications device which includes a means for enabling the cosmetic carrier attachment to be easily attached to and removed from the electronic communications device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic carrier attachment of the present invention is designed for attachment to an electronic communications device such as a cellular telephone or other device that enables electronic messaging via the internet. The cosmetic carrier attachment includes a cosmetic case capable of holding at least one cosmetic item such as an eye color, a lip color, a cheek color, or a foundation, and means for attaching a back side of the cosmetic case to a back side of an electronic communications device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the cosmetic case includes a first half and a second half, wherein at least one of the halves is capable of retaining a cosmetic item, and a hinge connecting the two halves so that one half can be folded over the other half. In another aspect of the invention, the cosmetic case includes a housing capable of retaining at least one cosmetic item and a cover that slidably fits over the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The attachment means for attaching the cosmetic case to the electronic communications device may take one of several forms. For example, the attachment means may include at least one lip member that can be attached to the back side of the electronic communications device and at least one channel contained within the back side of the cosmetic case so that the channel can receive the lip member in order to secure the cosmetic case to the electronic communications device. In another example, a pocket having a slit may be attached to the back side of an electronic communications device and the cosmetic case may have a flap member secured to it so that the slit contained within the pocket can receive the flap member in order to secure the cosmetic case to the electronic communications device. Both the lip member and the pocket may be either permanently or removably attached to the back of the electronic communications device with either a permanent or removable adhesive or the like. In yet another example, the cosmetic case may have a flap member secured to it and the flap member may be used to secure the cosmetic case to an electronic communications device by sliding the flap member between the electronic communications device and a cover for the electronic communications device such as a leather carrying case designed to hold the electronic communications device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the invention, the cosmetic case may also include a mirror and in yet another aspect of the invention, a clip member may also be attached to the cosmetic case. The cosmetic case may be configured in any shape but is especially useful and efficient when configured in a rectangular shape that matches the approximate dimensions of the back of the electronic communications device to which it is attached.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The following descriptions are of exemplary embodiments of the invention only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description is intended to provide a convenient illustration for implementing various embodiments of the invention. As will become apparent, various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, though not specifically described, many shapes and orientations of the cosmetic case and alternative attachment means should be understood to fall within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention comprises a cosmetic carrier attachment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which includes a cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and means for attaching cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as the PALM PILOT shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a first half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a second half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which are connected by a hinge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to enable halves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be folded against one another. Further, the attachment means of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a pair of lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (See also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>) that are attachable to a back side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>) of electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a pair of channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located within a back side <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which correlate with lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that only one lip member and its associated channel would function to secure an attachment of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Moreover, more than two lip members and their associated channels may also be used to secure such an attachment. In order to ensure that lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are aligned with channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to ensure that lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can engage channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for attachment, lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are preferably engaged with channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> prior to attachment to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A permanent or removable adhesive or the like is applied to the surface of lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are not engaged with channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the adhesive backed lip members are then applied to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while still engaged with channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. After securing lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to back side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be disengaged from channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by sliding lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> out of an open end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This method of attaching lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ensures that lip members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be properly aligned with channels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> contained within back side <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when subsequently engaged and re-engaged to attach cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In order to attach cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, flap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is bent against a back side of second half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that top edge <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of flap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can engage slit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in pocket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> by moving flap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> after flap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is beant against back side of second half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is closed by folding first half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over second half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the same embodiment of cosmetic carrier attachment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention sown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> with the addition of a clip housing or holster <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is capable of retaining the combined cosmetic carrier attachment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The combined attachment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are slid into holster <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A clip <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is attached to a back of holster <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> for easy transport and carrying of the combined attachment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present invention in an open position. Cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes first half <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a palette <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with openings for housing one or more cosmetic items <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which may be contained in cosmetic tins <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> so that they can be easily replaced once they are used up, and second half <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> containing mirror <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent that many alterations of the cosmetic carrier attachment embodiments described herein may be made. For example, although the cosmetic case is shown to be rectangular in shape in the above described embodiments, the cosmetic case may take on any shape or configuration as long as it is thin enough to ensure that its attachment to an electronic communications device would not result in a combination that would be too awkward or inconvenient to carry by a user. Further, the attachment means described above can be configured and arranged in a variety of ways for attaching cosmetic case <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to electronic communications device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Lastly, various aspects of the invention have been described in illustrative embodiments. Of course, many modifications and combinations of the above-described structures, arrangements, proportions, elements, materials and components, used in the practice of the invention, in addition to those not specifically described, may be varied and particularly adapted to specific environments and operating requirements without departing from those principles. </paragraph>
