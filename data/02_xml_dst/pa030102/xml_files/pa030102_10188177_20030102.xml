<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to devices for the protection of the soles of athletic shoes and specifically relates to protective devices which are structured to be easily secured about and removed from athletic shoes to protect the soles thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Athletic shoes have become very popular in the past few decades as footwear not only for sports participation, but for general everyday wear. With their increased popularity has come a corresponding increase in the cost of athletic shoes such that a single pair of athletic shoes may cost over two hundred dollars. Therefore, there is a great incentive to maintain the condition of one&apos;s shoes to maximize the wear and serviceable life of the shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For people who play sports, there is a particular concern for maintaining the condition of the shoes since athletic shoes that are designed for a certain sport may be very expensive. For example, athletic shoes that are designed for playing indoor basketball are constructed to provide maximum traction and foot protection on wooden floors. If a basketball player then wears those athletic shoes off the basketball court, the soles of the shoes become worn and degraded by the cement or gravel of conventional walking surfaces. In no time at all, the sole of the shoes become unsuitable for use on an indoor basketball court. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Owners of wooden-floor basketball courts are particularly concerned about the wearing of athletic shoes on the court when those shoes have been worn outside because the soles of the shoes pick up, or are embedded with, gravel and other fine abrasives that scratch the floor of the court. The damage that can occur to wooden-floor basketballs courts is significant and costly to repair. Therefore, court owners now routinely prohibit players, or anyone else stepping on the court, from wearing street shoes on the court. To accommodate that prohibition, players must change their shoes before playing on the court. Players arrive at the court venue, remove their street shoes and put on their athletic shoes, then remove their athletic shoes after the game and put their street shoes back on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Indoor basketball players typically take their athletic shoes off in a locker room or other dressing area before leaving the building to preserve their shoes. However, stopping to remove one&apos;s shoes can be time consuming and if players are in a hurry to leave the venue, they may not have time to stop and change their shoes. This is particularly true in the case of young boys or girls of middle school or high school age who play successive games of basketball at different schools. If they are being transported by bus, for example, to a nearby school for another game and they must quickly board the bus, they may not have time to change their athletic shoes to street shoes and then back to athletic shoes when they arrive at their next game destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, for both professional and non-professional players alike, it would be advantageous to provide a device to protect the soles of athletic shoes which is easily attached to and detached from the athletic shoes while the wearer has the shoes on so that the wearer may avoid having to remove his athletic shoes before walking on a non-court surface, and which allows the wearer to walk in any area or on any surface off the court without causing damage to the soles of the athletic shoes. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a device is provided for protecting the soles of athletic shoes which is easily attached to and removed from the athletic shoes while the shoes are on the wearer&apos;s feet, thereby allowing the wearer to walk on any surface without damaging the soles of the athletic shoes. While the sole-protecting device of the present invention is disclosed herein with respect to use with athletic shoes, the device may be employed with any kind of shoe the sole of which the wearer wishes to protect from damage caused by walking on street surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The sole-protecting device of the present invention comprises a base member and securement members attached to the base member to secure the base member to the sole of an athletic shoe. The base member generally comprises a substantially flattened structure which is sized to approximate the size, shape and/or dimension of the sole of a shoe. The size of the base member may vary, but it is generally desirable for the base member to be co-extensive in size with the sole of the athletic shoe, and to even be slightly larger in size so that the sole of the shoe resides entirely within the perimeter of the base member. The base member may be made of any material suitable for use as the sole of a shoe, including natural and synthetic materials. Preferably, the base member is made of a flexible material which allows the base member to bend with the athletic shoe sole when walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The securement members of the present invention may be any suitable device, apparatus or system that secures the base member to the sole of an athletic shoe. It is preferred, however, that the securement members be a simplified system which allows the wearer to quickly attach the device to an athletic shoe and quickly remove the device. Therefore, by way of example only, the securement members may comprise a toe-engaging member which secures the toe of the shoe to the base member and a more rearwardly positioned engaging member which secures the rearward portion of the shoe to the base member. For example, the rearward engaging securement members may comprise a heel-engaging member or an instep engaging member, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The sole-protecting device of the present invention may be configured such that the securement members are arranged to provide easy slip-on and slip-off of the device relative to the athletic shoe. Moreover, the securement members may preferably be structured to provide selectively adjustability of the securement members over or about the athletic shoe to increase engagement of the device to the shoe and to accommodate various sizes of shoes. The securement members may, therefore, be constructed with selective adjustment apparatus or members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The foregoing elements and features of the present invention, and the function of the invention, are described in further detail hereinafter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the sole-protecting device of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which may generally be flat to contact the sole of an athletic shoe, and is sized in shape and dimension to receive the sole of an athletic shoe thereon, as further shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are configured and located to detachably secure the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to an athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material which supports the sole of the athletic shoe and does not damage the sole of the shoe. The material may, most suitably, have some degree of flexibility to facilitate flexure of the sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while the wearer is walking with the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> attached to his or her shoes. However, the material may, in certain applications, be more suitably selected to be substantially inflexible. Exemplar materials that may be used in forming the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, rubber, flexible plastic, polymeric materials, leather and the like. The material may be synthetic or natural. Moreover, the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be structured with a bottom surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is configured to provide particular traction on walking surfaces, such as may be encountered in the winter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be any suitable device, apparatus or means for securing the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the sole of the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) in a manner which allows the wearer to easily and quickly secure the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then quickly remove the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from contact with the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when desired. By way of example only, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate various types of securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and arrangements that may be used in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprise at least one toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is positioned to fit over and engage the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the region of the toe of the shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further comprise at least one rearwardly shoe-engaging member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is positioned to fit about a rearward portion of the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to secure the rear of the shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the rearwardly shoe-engaging member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may comprise a heel-engaging member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> positioned to fit about the heel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to maintain the sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in secure engagement with the shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> further illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention in which the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprise a heel-engaging member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a particularly suitable embodiment, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may further include an instep-engaging member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is positioned to span over and engage the instep portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In yet another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the sole-protecting device may comprise a toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an instep-engaging member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with no heel-engaging member, thereby providing a slip-on type configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be attached to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner and may be structured in any suitable manner which will provide easy attachment and detachment of the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As shown, for example, the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be configured as straps that are secured to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are sized to span about or across the shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the sole of which is positioned on the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or straps may be made of any suitable material that is either moderately elastic or inelastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to structure the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to provide selective adjustability thereof to assure a snug fit of the sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the athletic shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to accommodate varying size or shapes of shoes. Thus, for example, the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be made of slightly elastic material which allows the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or straps to engage the shoe. Further, the securement members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be configured with a selectively adjustable mechanism. For example, toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may further comprise an adjustable first fastening element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along one edge thereof, and a second fastening element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connected to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along an opposing edge thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The first fastening element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and second fastening element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably structured with interlocking means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which allow the two elements to be quickly engaged and secured together, and then quickly disengaged to remove the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the shoe <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By way of example only, the interlocking means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be hook and loop tabs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, one positioned on the free end of second fastening element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and a corresponding hook and loop tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> positioned at the free end of first fastening element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the instep-engaging member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a first fastening element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as being secured to an anchoring tab <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that is in turn connected to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along one edge thereof, and a second fastening element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is illustrated as being secured to an anchoring tab <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is connected to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the opposing edge thereof. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the first fastening element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and second fastening element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may each be connected directly to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The instep-engaging member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also structured with interlocking means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to secure the first fastening element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and second fastening element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> together. The interlocking means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thereof may also be structured with a hook and loop tab <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> positioned at the free end of second fastening element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a corresponding hook and loop tab <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> positioned at the free end of first fastening element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The heel-engaging strap <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be configured as a single length of material having a first end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is secured, such as by stitching, to the second fastening element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of instep-engaging strap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and having a second, free end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is structured to be secured to the first fastening element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and anchoring tab <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> by some means, such as stitching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may further include at least one side member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is secured at one end to the toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and secured at the other end to a rearwardly-engaging member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, either the instep-engaging member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or the heel-engaging member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, as suggested in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the sole-protecting device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may further comprise a second side member <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which is likewise secured at one end to the toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and secured at the other end to a rearwardly-engaging member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative configuration of the present invention comprising a base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a single rearwardly-engaging member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising a heel-engaging member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The heel-engaging member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may also be comprised of a first fastening element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a second fastening element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which are selectively securable one to the other such as by use of interlocking means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. As previously described, any interlocking means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be used, but hook and loop tabs are shown by way of example only. Further, it is shown that a buckle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, positioned on the toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may be employed as but one alternative type of interlocking means. It should also be noted that the toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> does not need to be structured as two elements for securing together, but may be a single continuous length of material securely attached at both ends to the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the wearer to slip the toe of the athletic shoe beneath the toe-engaging member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sole-protecting device of the present invention is designed to protect the soles of athletic or other types of shoes from wear or degradation by contacting conventional street surfaces. The sole-protecting device may be adapted to any number of different types of shoes other than athletic shoes. Hence, reference herein to specific details of the structure and function of the present invention is by reference only and not by way of limitation. </paragraph>
