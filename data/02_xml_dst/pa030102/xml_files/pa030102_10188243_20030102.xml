<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to fluid-filled vibration-damping devices exhibiting vibration damping effect on the basis of flows of non-compressible fluid filled therein. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with such a fluid-filled vibration-damping device that is novel in construction, and that is capable of providing an improved fluid-tight sealing without deteriorating efficiency in assembling and manufacturing the fluid-filled vibration-damping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A fluid-filled vibration-damping device is known as one type of a vibration damping device interposed between two members of a vibration system for elastically connecting the two members, or for mounting one of the two members of the vibration system on the other member in a vibration damping fashion. JP-A-8-291844, JP-A-2001-59540 and JP-A-10-38016 disclose known examples of such a fluid-filled vibration-damping device, which includes a first mounting member adapted to be attached to one of the two members of the vibration system, a second mounting member adapted to be attached to the other member of the vibration system, and a rubber elastic body that is bonded at its central portion to the first mounting member and at its outer circumferential portion to the second mounting member for elastically connecting the first and second mounting members. The rubber elastic body partially defines a pressure-receiving chamber on one of opposite-side thereof. The pressure-receiving chamber is filled with the non-compressible fluid and adapted to receive vibrational load applied to the fluid-filled vibration-damping device. On the other side of the rubber elastic body, a flexible diaphragm formed of a rubber material is disposed so as to extend between the first and second mounting members, whereby the rubber elastic body and the flexible diaphragm cooperate to define therebetween an equilibrium chamber partially defined by the flexible diaphragm. The equilibrium chamber is filled with the non-compressible fluid, and has a volume that is variable due to deformation of the flexible diaphragm. The fluid-filled vibration-damping device further includes an first orifice passage for a fluid communication between the pressure-receiving chamber and the equilibrium chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the sake of efficiency in manufacture, the known fluid-filled vibration-damping device as disclosed in the aforesaid publication documents is arranged such that the rubber elastic body and the flexible diaphragm are formed independently from each other, and the rubber elastic body is bonded at its central portion to a central metal member for the rubber elastic body (hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;elastic-body central metal member&rdquo;), while the flexible diaphragm is bonded at its central portion to a central metal member for the flexible diaphragm (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;diaphragm central metal member&rdquo;). These elastic-body and diaphragm central metal members are superposed on and fixed to each other, thereby providing the first mounting member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in the aforementioned JP-A-2001-59540 and JP-A-10-38016, for example, the conventional fluid-filled vibration-damping device is likely to suffer from a problem of leakage of the fluid originated in its structural feature. Namely, the elastic-body central metal member is provided with a fixing bolt protruding therefrom at which the first mounting member is fixed to one of the two members connected together in the vibration-damping fashion. On the other hand, the diaphragm central metal member is provided with a through hole formed through its central portion. These elastic-body and diaphragm central metal members are superposed on each other with the fixing bolt of the elastic body central metal member extending through the through hole of the diaphragm central portion. Consequently, an interface between the elastic-body central metal member and the diaphragm central metal member are substantially directly exposed to the atmosphere at the through hole portion of the diaphragm central metal member. Since an outer peripheral portion of the interface between the elastic-body central metal member and the diaphragm central metal member faces to the equilibrium chamber, the non-compressible fluid filling the equilibrium chamber is likely to be leaked out through the interface and the through hole of the diaphragm central metal member. In this respect, it should be noted that the fluid-filled vibration-damping device disclosed in the above described JP-A-8-291844 also suffers from the same inherent problem, although a clear depiction of the through hole formed through the diaphragm central metal member is just omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the conventional fluid-filled vibration-damping devices shown in the above-described publication documents, moreover, the elastic-body central metal member and the diaphragm central metal member are just superposed on each other at their plane abutting surfaces, in order to constitute the first mounting member. This arrangement makes it difficult to precisely position the two central metal members relative to each other upon assembling these two members together, and may possibly cause displacement of the two central metal members relative to each other, leading to undesirable leakage of the non-compressible fluid through the interface between abutting surfaces of the two central metal members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, the diaphragm central metal member is not directly fixed to the elastic-body central metal member, but is just gripped by and between the elastic-body central metal member and the one member of the two members connected together in the vibration damping fashion, to which the elastic-body central metal member is bolted. This conventional structure is likely to cause looseness between the elastic-body central metal member and the diaphragm central metal member due to an effect of the vibrations applied thereto, resulting in difficulty in assuring a high fluid-tight sealing at the interface between the two central metal members with high stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> JP-A-9-257090 discloses an example of modification of the above-described fluid-filled vibration-damping device proposed in an attempt to cope with the above-described conventional problem, in which the elastic body and the flexible diaphragm are formed as components of an integral vulcanized products. However, it is difficult in view of the shape or structure of a mold for forming the integral vulcanized product including the elastic body and the flexible diaphragm as the components. Further, such an integral vulcanized product makes it impossible to select suitable materials for the elastic body and the flexible diaphragm, respectively, in the light of required characteristics of the respective ones. For the above reasons, the proposed modification is not sufficient to solve the conventional problem. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore one object of this invention to provide a fluid-filled vibration-damping device novel in construction and capable of establishing an excellent fluid-tight sealing its chambers fluid with a non-compressible fluid with simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The above and/or other objects of this invention may be attained according to at least one of the following modes of the invention. Each of these modes of the invention is numbered like the appended claims and depending from the other mode or modes, where appropriate, to indicate possible combinations of elements or technical features of the invention. It is to be understood that the principle of the invention is not limited to these modes of the invention and combinations of the technical features, but may otherwise be recognized based on the teachings of the present invention disclosed in the entire specification and drawings or that may be recognized by those skilled in the art in the light of the present disclosure in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (1) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device for connecting two members in a vibration damping fashion, comprising: (a) a first mounting member connectable to one of the two members; (b) a second mounting member connectable to an other of the two member; (c) an elastic body bonded at an central portion thereof to the first mounting member and at an outer circumferential portion thereof to the second mounting member in a process of vulcanization of a rubber material for forming the elastic body, for elastically connecting the first and second mounting members; (d) a pressure-receiving chamber disposed on one of axially opposite sides of the elastic body, filled with a non-compressible fluid and partially defined by the elastic body, to which a vibrational load is applied; (e) a flexible rubber layer disposed on an other one of axially opposite side of the elastic body so as to form an equilibrium chamber between the flexible rubber layer and the elastic body, the equilibrium chamber being filled with the non-compressible fluid and partially defined by the flexible rubber layer so as to easily permit a volumetric change thereof; and (f) a first orifice passage for fluid communication between the pressure-receiving chamber and the equilibrium chamber. The first mounting member includes an elastic-body central member bonded to the central portion of the elastic body, and a rubber-layer central member bonded to a central portion of the flexible rubber layer and having a fixing portion at which the first mounting member is connected to the one of the two member, and the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member are superposed on and fixed to each other at their abutting surfaces by means of a fixing mechanism, to thereby constitute the first mounting member. One of the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member has a fitting recess open in the abutting surface thereof, and an other one of the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member has a fitting protrusion formed on the abutting surface thereof and being fitted into the fitting recess so that the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member are positioned relative to each other, and a peripheral portion of an interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member entirely faces the equilibrium chamber and/or the pressure-receiving chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to this mode of the invention, the peripheral portion of the interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body and rubber-layer central members entirely faces to the equilibrium chamber and/or the pressure-receiving chamber, without being exposed to the external area or the atmosphere, thus preventing undesirable leakage of the non-compressible fluid through the interface between these central members. Therefore, the fluid-filled vibration-damping device of this mode of the invention is capable of securing a high fluid-tight sealing of the fluid chambers filled with the non-compressible fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Also, the use of the fitting mechanism established the fitting recess and the fitting projection enables to position the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member relative to each other with ease and preciseness, thus achieving improvement both in production efficiency and product quality. Moreover, the use of the combination of the fitting recess and the fitting projection prevents the engagement of the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member loosing, thus establishing the high fluid-tight sealing of the chambers filled with the non-compressible fluid for a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The fixing portion of the rubber-layer central member may have a variety of forms including a bolt or a threaded nut. The fixing mechanism for fixing the elastic-body and the rubber-layer central members together may be selected from known fixing mechanism established by pressing and by calking, and other possible fixing structures, e.g., a bolt or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (2) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above mode (1), wherein the fitting recess has an inner circumferential surface with a tapered shape that corresponds to a tapered shape of an outer circumferential surface of the fitting protrusion. The fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to this mode of the invention permits an improved efficiency in assembling the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member together, since these tapered surfaces function as a guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (3) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above-indicated mode (2), wherein the fitting recess includes a press-fitting hole formed in a bottom wall thereof so as to axially extend with a substantially constant inner diameter, while the fitting protrusion includes a press-fitting part integrally formed at a protruding end portion thereof, the press-fitting part being press-fitted into the press-fitting hole to thereby provide the fixing mechanism. According to this mode of the invention, the fixing mechanism can be embodied with simple structure. The press-fitting part may be provided with a cutout portion as needed, in order to reduce the weight thereof or alternatively to reduce a press-fitting force that is applied by the press-fitting part to the press-fitting hole upon the press-fitting. The press-fitting hole may be a recess or alternatively be a bore extending through the bottom wall of the fitting recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (4) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(3), wherein the elastic-body central member includes a fixing bore open in the abutting surface thereof and extending therethrough in a direction in which the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member are superposed on each other, while the rubber-layer central member includes a fixing shaft protruding therefrom, the fixing shaft extending through the fixing bore and disengageably fixed at a tip end thereof to the elastic-body central member, to thereby provide the fixing mechanism. This arrangement enables the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member to be firmly engaged together, thereby exhibiting a strong force resistive to an axial force that causes disengagement of the elastic-body and rubber-layer central members. The fixing bore and the fixing shaft may be constituted by the press-fitting hole and the press-fitting part constructed according to the above-indicated mode (3). The fixing shaft may be formed as an integral part of the rubber-layer central member, or may be formed independently of and bonded to the rubber-layer central member by means of known fastening members, e.g., screws or the like. Further, a variety of methods are adoptable for disengageably fixing the fixing shaft to the fixing bore. For instance, the fixing shaft is disengageably fixed to the fixing bore such that a tip end portion of the fixing shaft is calked against the open-end portion of the fixing bore, or alternatively such that the tip end of the fixing shaft is provided with a bolt or rivet that is fitting on the open-end portion of the fixing bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (5) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(4), further comprising: an elastic-body outer sleeve member bonded to an outer circumferential portion of the elastic body; and a rubber layer outer sleeve member bonded to an outer circumferential portion of the flexible rubber layer, wherein the elastic-body and rubber-layer outer sleeve members are fixed together to constitute the second mounting member, and cooperate with each other to at least partially define the first orifice passage therebetween. This arrangement makes it possible to form the first orifice passage that is simple in construction with a reduced number of components, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced cost of manufacture of the orifice member. These outer sleeve members may be formed of metallic or synthetic resin members having cylindrical or circumferential wall portions utilized to define the first orifice passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (6) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(5), further comprising a narrow passage adapted to connect the interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member to at least one of the equilibrium chamber and the pressure-receiving chamber. In the fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to this mode of the invention, the narrow passage may be utilized to suction an air undesirably remained within the equilibrium chamber and/or the pressure-receiving chamber, upon assembling the elastic-body central member and the rubber-layer central member together Thus, the fluid-filled vibration-damping device can exhibit an improved stability in terms of its quality and capability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (7) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(6), wherein the first mounting member includes an injection bore extending through the elastic-body and rubber-layer central members in a direction in which the central members are superposed on each other, and an opening of the injection bore is fluid-tightly closed by a sealing member after filling the device with the non-compressible fluid through the injection bore. In the fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to this mode of the invention, the injection bore may be utilized to perform a known vacuum suction method for filling the pressure-receiving chamber and the equilibrium chamber with the non-compressible fluid. More specifically, the pressure-receiving and the equilibrium chambers are vacuumed through the injection bore, and then filled with the non-compressible fluid through the injection bore instantly, ensuring an easy and rapid filling operation. Also, the opening of the injection bore is fluid-tightly closed or sealed by means of a suitably sealing member after the termination of the process to fill the equilibrium and pressure-receiving chamber with the non-compressible fluid, thus eliminating a problem of leakage of the non-compressible fluid through the injection bore. That is, the fluid-filled vibration-damping device of this mode of the invention permits both of the desired high fluid-tight sealing of the device and an improved efficiency in the process of filling the pressure-receiving chamber and the equilibrium chamber with the non-compressible fluid. A known blind rivet or the like may be preferably employed as the sealing member adapted to fluid-tightly close the opening of the injection bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> (8) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(7), further comprising: a heat shielding sleeve disposed radially outwardly of the flexible rubber layer and fixed at one of axially opposite end portion thereof to the second mounting member, wherein an other one of axially opposite end portion of the heat shielding sleeve extends radially inwardly so as to provide a stop portion that is opposed to the first mounting member with a given spacing in an axial direction of the device and/or a radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction, and the stop portion is brought into abutting contact with the first mounting member via a buffer so as to limit an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the flexible rubber layer, which is a thin-walled member having a low strength and a great amount of deformation, is disposed radially outward of the elastic body and located in the outermost portion of the fluid-filled vibration-damping device. The flexible rubber layer may possibly be damaged due to undesirable contacts with other components and be affected by heat emitted from the internal engine mount or the like, JP-A-10-38016 discloses a technique to cope with this problem, in which the flexible rubber layer is formed of a heat resistive rubber material different from the material of the elastic body. The proposed technique undesirably limits materials of the flexible rubber layer in view of its heat resistance, resulting in insufficient properties of the flexible rubber layer in terms of corrosion resistance, ozone resistance, physical strength and the like. However, the heat shielding sleeve is disposed radially outwardly of the flexible rubber layer and substantially entirely covers the flexible rubber layer in this mode of the invention. Therefore, the flexible rubber layer is effectively prevented from possible damages due to the contact with the other components, and possible deterioration caused by the heat emitted from an internal combustion engine or the like. This arrangement leading to an enhanced degree of freedom in selecting materials of the elastic body and the flexible rubber layer as well, thus ensuring desired durability and properties of the flexible rubber layer in terms of ozone, chemical and heat resistances. Also, the thin-walled flexible rubber layer is likely to transmit heat emitted from the outside to the fluid filled within equilibrium chamber, possibly leading to undesirable change in the viscosity of the fluid and gas separation occurred within the fluid, resulting in deterioration of the damping characteristics of the vibration damping device. The use of the heat shielding sleeve is able to eliminate this inherent problem in the fluid-filled vibration-damping device where the flexible rubber layer is disposed in the outermost position of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, the heat shielding sleeve also functions to constitute a stop mechanism in cooperation with the first mounting member in order to limit an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting member relative to each other in a shock absorbing manner. That is, the present mode (8) of the invention makes it possible to provide not only the heat shielding mechanism but also the stop mechanism as well with simple structure in a fluid-filled vibration-damping device having a unique structure in which the equilibrium chamber is disposed on the axially outward of the elastic body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The stop portion of the heat shielding sleeve may be used to constitute a stop mechanism arranged to limit an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members relative to each other in one or both of opposite axial directions of these mounting members. Alternatively, the stop mechanism may be arranged to limit an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members relative to each other in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction, instead of or in addition to the axial direction. For instance, the first mounting member is integrally or fixedly provided with a recess open in its outer circumferential surface with a rectangular shape in its cross section, and the stop member of the heat shielding sleeve is disposed within the recess, so that the stop member is opposed to the inner surface of the recess in both of the axial and radial directions of the first and second mounting members via a suitable buffer. As a result, the stop member and the recess cooperate to form a multi-directional stop mechanism capable of limiting the displacement of the first and second mounting members in various directions with a simple structure and reduced numbers of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (9) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above-indicated mode (8), further comprising: an elastic-body outer sleeve member bonded to an outer circumferential portion of the elastic body; and a rubber-layer outer sleeve member bonded to an outer circumferential portion of the flexible rubber layer, the elastic-body and rubber-layer outer sleeve members being fixed together to partially constitute the second mounting member, wherein the rubber-layer central member extends radially outwardly from the elastic-body central member so as to provide an abutting portion that is brought into abutting contact with the stop portion of the heat shielding sleeve in the axial direction of the device, and the flexible rubber layer is bonded at the central portion thereof to the abutting portion of the rubber-layer central member, while the one of axially opposite end portion of the heat shielding sleeve is mounted on an outer circumferential surface of the rubber-layer outer sleeve member, and is fixed to the second mounting member by calking. In this arrangement, the rubber-layer central member is effectively utilized to provide the abutting portion with which the stop portion of the heat shielding sleeve is brought into contact, while avoiding undesirable enlargement of the first mounting member. Further, the flexible rubber layer is formed independently of the elastic body, thereby enhancing a degree of freedom in selecting materials of the elastic body and the flexible rubber layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (10) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above-indicated mode (9), further comprising a sealing rubber integrally formed at an outer peripheral portion of the flexible rubber layer over an entire circumference thereof so as to prevent entry of water into an interface between the heat shielding sleeve and the rubber-layer outer sleeve member. This arrangement is effective to prevent undesirable entry of water or other objects into the interference between the rubber-layer outer sleeve member and the heat shielding sleeve, thereby effectively preventing undesirable rust of these sleeve members. Preferably, the heat shielding sleeve may be provided with a drain hole located adjacent to the sealing portion between the heat shielding sleeve and the rubber-layer outer sleeve member in order to promptly drain water or other objects gathered at the sealing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (11) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (8)-(10), wherein the second mounting member has a tapered cylindrical portion formed at one of axially opposite end portion thereof and extending axially outwardly and radially outwardly, and the outer circumferential portion of the elastic body is bonded to the tapered cylindrical portion, and wherein the tapered cylindrical portion is provided with a cutout, while the elastic body is provided with a guide groove formed at a first circumferential position thereof so as to be contiguous with the cutout and so as to extend to the equilibrium chamber so that the cutout and the guide groove cooperate to connect the first orifice passage to the equilibrium chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This arrangement permits the elastic body to be supported at its outer circumferential portion by the tapered cylindrical portion, so that the elastic body can exhibit an approximately linear spring characteristics with stability with respect to a compressive load in the axial direction. Moreover, the axially lower side of the tapered cylindrical portion that is remote from the elastic body may be effectively utilized to provide the first orifice passage with high space utilization. The guide groove may be formed on the outer circumferential surface of the elastic body with various shapes so as to extend in various directions. For instance, the guide groove is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the elastic body so as to extend in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (12) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above-indicated mode (11), wherein the guide groove has a slope-like shape in which a depth dimension gradually decreases with an increase of a distance from the cutout. This arrangement facilitates smooth flows of the non-compressible fluid through the guide groove from the equilibrium chamber to the first orifice passage, whereby the vibration-damping device can exhibit a damping effect on the basis of the flows of the fluid in an effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The guide groove may extends on the outer circumferential surface of the elastic body in the axial direction, or alternatively in the circumferential direction. In the latter case, the guide groove functions to guide the fluid to flow in the direction approximate to a direction in which the fluid flows through the first orifice passage, and to elongate the guide groove, resulting in further improved smoothness of the flows of the fluid through the first orifice passage and the equilibrium chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (13) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to the above-indicated mode (12) wherein the elastic body further includes a volume balancing portion formed at a second circumferential position thereof so that a volume of the elastic body is well balanced about a central axis of the elastic body. The volume balancing portion of this mode of the invention makes it possible to well balance the volume of the elastic body about its central axis, thus preventing that the damping or supporting capability of the vibration-damping device is adversely effected or deteriorated by the guide groove formed on the elastic body. This arrangement permits a desired spring characteristics of the elastic body with respect to a static and active load in a stable manner, and eliminates stress concentration at a portion in which the guide groove is formed, resulting in improved durability of the elastic body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The volume balancing portion may have a variety forms. For instance, the volume balancing portion may be a cutout formed at the second circumferential position that is symmetrical to the first circumferential position with respect to the central axis of the elastic body, or alternatively may be a boss formed on an inner circumferential surface of the elastic body at a circumferential position corresponding to that of the guide groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (14) A fluid-filled vibration-damping device according to any one of the above-indicated modes (1)-(14), further comprising: a movable member partially defining the pressure-receiving chamber and being elastically supported by the second mounting member so as to be displaceable relative to the second mounting member; and an oscillating mechanism adapted to apply an oscillating force to the oscillating member in order to actively induce a fluid-pressure variation in the pressure-receiving chamber. That is, the movable member and the oscillating force cooperate each other to provide the oscillating mechanism in the present embodiment. According to this mode of the invention, an active-type fluid-filled vibration-damping device may be embodied, in which the fluid-pressure variation induced in the pressure-receiving chamber upon application of vibrational loads to the pressure-receiving chamber can be actively compensated or reduced by the oscillating force generated by the oscillating member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the case where the first orifice passage is disposed outside of the pressure-receiving chamber, the pressure-receiving chamber is allowed to have a relatively large volume and the movable member can face to the pressure-receiving chamber with a relatively large surface area. Therefore, such a movable member can generate a relatively large amount of fluid-pressure variation in the pressure-receiving chamber by a relatively small amount of displacement thereof. Meanwhile, the oscillating mechanism may be selected from a pneumatic-type, an electrostrictive-type and a magnetostrictive-type actuator as well as an electrostrictive-type actuator, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pressure-receiving chamber is divided by a partition member into a primary fluid chamber partially defined by the elastic body and an auxiliary fluid chamber partially defined by the movable member, and these primary and auxiliary fluid chambers are held in fluid communication through a second orifice passage. In this arrangement, fluid-pressure variation induced in the auxiliary fluid chamber by the oscillation of the movable member is efficiently transmitted to the pressure-receiving chamber with the help of resonance of the fluid flowing through the second orifice passage. As a result, the fluid-filled vibration-damping device of this arrangement can exhibit an active damping effect in an effective manner, with respect to vibrations whose frequency is held within a frequency range to which the second orifice passage is tuned.</paragraph>

This engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are made of suitable metallic materials. These first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are elastically connected to each other by an elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. The first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adapted to be attached to a power unit of the vehicle, while the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is adapted to be attached to a body of the vehicle, so that the power unit is mounted on the vehicle body in a vibration damping fashion. With the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> installed on the vehicle as described above, a static load or weight of the power unit and a primary vibrational load act between the first and second mounting members in an approximately axial direction of the engine mount, that is generally parallel to the vertical direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the following description, the vertical direction is basically oriented in the vertical direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Described in detail, the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an elastic-body central member in the form of an elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a rubber-layer central member in the form of a diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an elastic-body outer sleeve member in the form of an elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a rubber-layer outer sleeve member in the form of a diaphragm outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is bonded at its central portion to the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and at its outer circumferential portion to the elastic body outer-circumferential metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the process of vulcanization of a rubber material to form the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a first integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). On the other hand, a flexible rubber layer in the form of a flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is bonded at its central portion to the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and at its outer circumferential portion to the diaphragm outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the process of vulcanization of a rubber material to form the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a second integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). These first and second integral vulcanized products <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are assembled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as one component of the first integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, has an inverted generally truncated conical shape, and is formed with a fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending therethrough in its axial direction and open in its axially opposite ends, i.e., a large diameter end face and a small diameter end face. The axially upper end portion of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> serves as a fitting recess in the form of a guide bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having an inner surface with a mortar or tapered shape so that the guide bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a diameter gradually increasing toward the large diameter end face. The axially lower end portion of the guide bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> serves as a press-fitting hole in the form of a cylindrical fitting bore <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extending axially downwardly with a generally constant inner diameter, to be open in the small diameter end face of the elastic-body central member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a generally large diameter thin-walled cylindrical shape, a flange portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> integrally formed at an axially lower end portion of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to extend radially outwardly, and a tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> integrally formed at an axially upper end portion of the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> gradually increases in the axially outward direction. The elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> constructed as described above thus provides a circumferential groove open in its outer circumferential surface. The elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed on the side of the tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a given axial spacing therebetween, while being held in a generally concentric or coaxial relationship with the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this state, the tapered outer circumferential surface of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is spaced away from and opposed to the tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the axial direction of the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and these opposed surfaces of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are elastically connected with each other via the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> interposed therebetween. </paragraph>

The elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is superposed and bonded at its large-diameter outer circumferential surface on and to the tapered cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in the above-described vulcanization. Thus, it is formed the first vulcanized product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> consisting of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the elastic-body outer-cylindrical member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A sealing rubber layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> integrally formed with the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> coats and is bonded to a substantially entire area of an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the elastic body outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and extends at its lower end portion to the lower surface of the flange portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as one component of the second integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an abutting portion in the form of a disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending radially outwardly therefrom, and a fixing portion in the form of a boss-shaped projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> protruding axially outwardly from the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as integrally formed parts. The boss-shaped projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, thereby serving as a fixing nut. Thus, the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are firmly fixed to the power unit of the vehicle by a mounting bolt (not shown) threaded into the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a rod shaped fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> integrally formed at its axially intermediate portion so as to protrude axially downwardly. The axially upper portion of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> serves as a fitting protrusion in the form of a fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, while the axially lower portion of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> serves as a press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Described in detail, the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a tapered outer circumferential surface with an outer diameter gradually decreasing in the axially downward direction from the bottom surface of the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has an outer configuration or profile that confirms to an inner surface configuration or profile of the fitting guide recess <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while having a size that is substantially equal to and slightly smaller than the size of the fitting guide recess <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a generally circular rod shape and extends axially straightly with a substantially same diameter that is made substantially equal to or slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the fitting bore <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> open in the axially lower end of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and extends in the axial direction with a given axial depth. In the presence of the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the axially lower end portion of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> serves as a calking part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a state of the calking part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> before being calked against the elastic-body inner metal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a thin-walled large-diameter cylindrical shape, and includes an annular inward projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> integrally formed at its axially upper open end portion so as to slightly protrude radially inwardly, and a flange portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> integrally formed at its axially lower open-end portion so as to extend radially outwardly. The protruding end portion of the flange portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is bent axially downwardly, to thereby provide an integrally formed annular fitting surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed on the side of the inner projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with an axial and radial spacing therebetween, while being held in coaxial relationship with the inner projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm outer sleeve member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are elastically connected with each other via the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a generally thin-walled annular plate-like shape, and has a large amount of slag at its central portion for facilitate elastic deformation thereof. In other words, the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a bellows-shaped member extending axially outwardly and radially outwardly. The inner peripheral portion of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is bonded to an outer circumferential surface of the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the process of vulcanization of a rubber material for forming the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The outer peripheral portion of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, is bonded to the inward projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the above-described vulcanization. Thus, it is formed the second integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> consisting of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A sealing rubber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> integrally formed with the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> coats and is bonded to a substantially entire area of the inner circumferential surface of the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such that an axially upper end portion of the sealing rubber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> coats entirely the inward projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and an axially lower end portion of the sealing rubber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extends to the lower surface of the flange portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The thus formed second integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is superposed on and assembled with the first integral vulcanized product <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the vertical or axial direction, such that the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed to the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fixed to the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this state, the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed radially outwardly of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a given spacing therebetween, so as to surround an entire outer circumferential surface of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> That is, the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is held in close contact with the upper end face of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inserted into and positioned relative to the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the fitting part <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively, whereby the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to each other in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction thereof. Since the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is press-fitted into the fitting part <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are directly fixed to each other to thereby form the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the tapered inner surface of the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a function to guide the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into a desired fixing position, when the elastic-body and diaphragm inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are assembled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> With the elastic-body and diaphragm inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> assembled together as described above, the calking part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> integrally formed at a protruding end portion of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is subjected to a suitable calking operation, thereby being bent radially outwardly and being calked against a peripheral portion of the small diameter end face of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, the diaphragm inner metallic member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disengageably fixed to the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As is understood from the foregoing description, a fixing mechanism to fix the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together is composed of the press-fitting mechanism provided by the fitting part <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and the calking mechanism provided by the calking part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pushed onto the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the axially downward direction, to thereby be engaged with the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that the flange portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is superposed on the flange portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, while the annular inward projection <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is superposed on a peripheral portion of the axially upper end face of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With the elastic-body and diaphragm outer cylindrical metal members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> assembled together as described above, the opening of the circumferential groove in the outer circumferential surface of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fluid-tightly closed by the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided therein with a circumferential passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which is defined by and between the cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and which continuously extends circumferentially by a given circumferential length, or alternatively over an entire circumference of the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a relatively large diameter disk-like shape is laminated to the lower end face of the elastic body outer metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to thereby fluid-tightly close an opening of a large diameter recess <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The elastic-body and diaphragm outer cylindrical metal members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the rigid metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are superposed one another as described above, are fixed together, thereby providing the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, these three members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are fastened to one another by means of a tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a heat shielding sleeve in the form of a tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, both being made of metal, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a large-diameter round tubular shape, and includes an upper and an lower flange portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that are integrally formed at its axially upper and lower end portions so as to extend radially outwardly. The tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> also has a large-diameter round tubular shape, and includes a calking part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> integrally formed at its axially lower open-end portion so as to protrude radially outwardly. An axially upper open-end portion of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> partially extends axially upwardly, and is bent radially inwardly at its protruding end portion, thereby providing a stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as an integral part of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The upper flange portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the calking part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are assembled with the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the outer peripheral portions of the elastic-body cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sandwiched by and between the upper flange portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the calking part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the axial direction. The calking part <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is calked against the aforesaid outer peripheral portions of the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, whereby the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are fastened together by calking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The tubular bracket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which is assembled at its upper flange portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described above, is fixed at its lower flange portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the body (not shown) of the vehicle, for thereby mounting the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the body of the vehicle. The tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extends axially outwardly along the diaphragm outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is located above and opposed to the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an axial spacing therebetween. The stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> cooperate to form a stop mechanism in a rebound direction, where the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is brought into abutting contact with the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via a buffer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> attached to the disk-shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, thereby limiting an amount of axial displacement of the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in the direction in which the first and second mounting members away from each other (i.e., in the rebound direction). Another stop member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> equipped with a rubber buffer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is fixed to the outer circumferential surface of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, by means of bolts or the like. This stop member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> constitutes a stop mechanism in a bound direction. It should be noted that the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is disposed radially outwardly of and covers substantially entirely the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is stably protected from possible damages due to undesirable contact with the other components or flying rocks, and due to heat emitted from an internal combustion engine of the vehicle. Although the flexible diaphragm has a relatively small-wall thickness, the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> ensures an improved durability of the flexible diaphragm in comparison with a conventional fluid-filled vibration-damping device in which a thin-walled flexible diaphragm is directly exposed to the atmosphere and the emissive heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> With the opening of the recess <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fluid-tightly closed by the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> cooperate to define therebetween a pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> filled with the non-compressible fluid. The pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is partially defined by the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Upon application of vibrational loads between the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the pressure of the fluid in the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> changes due to the elastic deformation of the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a state where the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as well as while the elastic-body outer-cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm outer cylindrical metal member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are fluid-tightly assembled with each other, as described above, the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are assembled with each other while assuring a fluid-tight sealing both in their inner peripheral portions and their outer peripheral portions. Thus, the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> cooperate to define therebetween an equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> filled with the non-compressible fluid. This equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is partially defined by a flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and has a volume that is permitted to vary by displacement of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In order to assure an excellent vibration damping effect of the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a desired frequency band, on the basis of resonance or flows of the non-compressible fluid through a first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, the non-compressible fluid desirably has a viscosity not higher than 0.1 Pa.&middot;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The circumferential passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed within the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is held in fluid communication with the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> through a communication hole <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> formed at one circumferential position thereof, and with the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> through a communication hole <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a cutout formed at another circumferential position thereof, and a guide groove <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> open in the outer circumferential surface of the elastic body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contiguous to the communication hole <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Thus, the circumferential passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> serves to provide a first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> permitting flows of the fluid therethrough between the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and extending circumferentially with a given circumferential length. As well known in the art flows of the fluid through the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is caused by the fluid-pressure variation induced between the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> upon application of the vibrational loads. As a result, the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can exhibit a high vibration damping effect with respect to the input vibrational load based on resonance or flows of the fluid through the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Frequency characteristics of the vibration damping effect of the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the basis of the resonance of the fluid through the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, can be adjusted by tuning a ratio of the cross sectional area to the circumferential length of the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed as described above, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> bonded to the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> bonded to the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are superposed on each other and fixed together to form the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has no through hole, and is superposed on the axially upper or outer surface of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This arrangement eliminates or prevents that the interface between abutting surfaces of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is directly exposed to the atmosphere. Moreover, the peripheral portions of the interface between the abutting surfaces of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are held within the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> (see an axially lower end portion of the interface) and the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> (see an outer peripheral portion of the interface). Therefore, the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can fully assure an extremely high fluid-tight sealing at the interfaces between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having the tapered shape with a diameter gradually increases in the axially upward direction, effectively guiding the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upon inserting the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thus facilitating the assembling of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to each other in a radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction, by fitting the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be easily and accurately positioned relative to each other upon assembling thereof, and can be surely prevented from being displaced relative to each other upon application of a vibrational load between the two members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in use. Thus, the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of exhibiting a high reliability on a fluid-tight sealing of the non-compressible fluid for a long period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Further, the calking part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed at the protruding end portion of the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (or the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed by calking to the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, making it possible to increase a strength in the assembling of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, some of other embodiments of the present invention in the form of engine mounts will be described. The following embodiments are different from the aforementioned embodiment in terms of fixing mechanism for fixing the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together. The same reference numerals as used for the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are used to designate the corresponding elements and parts of the engine mounts according to the following embodiments, and the detailed description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> principle part of an engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for use in an automotive vehicle is shown as a second embodiment of a fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention. The elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of this engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, has a fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> integrally formed at an axially lower end face thereof. The fixing guide <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> having a generally inverted-frustoconical shape. The fixing guide projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a cup shaped tapped hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> open in a central portion of its lower end face thereof, rather than the press-fitting portion (<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) used in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to each other by fitting the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Further, a fixing bolt <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is inserted into the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the tapped hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is thread-engaged with the tapped hole <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A disk-shaped tip end portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is engaged with the lower end face of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Therefore, to fasten the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> makes it possible to apply a relatively large fastening force to the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for thereby moving these two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to each other in the axial direction. Since a disk-shaped head portion and a leg portion of the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are fitting in the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a lower end portion of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is effectively positioned relative to each other in a radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction, like the press-fitting portion (<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> That is, the engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the present invention is provided with a fixing mechanism composed of the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, thus being capable of exhibiting the same effects of the invention, which are described above with respect to the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. In addition, the engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> employs a bolt to fasten the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together, rather than a press-fitting operation, thereby facilitating the assembling of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a principle part of an engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for use in an automotive vehicle according to a third embodiment of a fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention. The engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that is a solid metal member having an inverted-frustoconical shape in its entirety. The elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a large-diameter upper end portion, which extends in the axial direction with a substantially constant diameter and serves as a press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further includes a diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> having an inverted cup shape with a circular cross section and a small depth. The inner peripheral portion of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is bonded to the lower end portion of a cylindrical wall portion of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the elastic body inner metal member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is forcedly press-fitted into the cylindrical wall portion of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As a result, the elastic-body and diaphragm inner metal members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are firmly fixed together such that the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> covers entirety the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The boss-shaped projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> has a horizontally extending mounting hole <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> rather than the tapped hole (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) as in the first embodiment, for attaching the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to a suitable member on the side of the power unit of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Like the aforesaid embodiments, the engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> constructed according to this embodiment has the same structural feature that the interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is not exposed to the external area but is held within the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can exhibit an excellent fluid-tight sealing, like the aforesaid embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is shown a principle part of an engine mount <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for use in an automotive vehicle constructed according to a fourth embodiment of a fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention. Like the engine mount (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) of the third embodiment, the engine mount <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is a solid metal member having an inverted-frustoconical shape in its entirety and a large-diameter or axially upper end portion extending axially with a substantially same diameter and serving as a press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> The engine mount <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also includes a diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> having an inverted cup shape with a circular cross section and a small depth. The diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is forcedly press-fitted onto the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, like the engine mount (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) of the third embodiment. In the present embodiment, particularly, the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes a circumferential constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> formed at an axially intermediate portion adjacent to the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the open end portion of the cylindrical wall of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which is disposed radially outwardly of the constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, is radially inwardly drawn or bent onto the constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, so as to function as an annular engaged part <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> firmly engaged with the constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the foregoing description, the engine mount <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> constructed according to the third embodiment of the present invention can enjoy a further improved bonding force or stability between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> as a result of the engagement between the engaged part <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, in addition to the effects of the present invention as described above with respect to the aforesaid embodiments. That is, the constricted part <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the engaged part <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> constitute the fixing mechanism for firmly fixing the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> together, in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown a principle part of an engine mount <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for use in an automotive vehicle constructed according to a fourth embodiment of a fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention. The engine mount <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes an elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> having the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> including the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a tapped part <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, like the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. Unlike the first embodiment, the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> has a tapped part <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> instead of the fixing part (<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). The tapped part <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> extends axially downwardly along an central axis of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and is contiguous to the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at its upper end, while being open in the axially lower end face of the inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at its lower end. The axially lower end portion of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a generally inverted-frustoconical shape in its entirety, and serves as a fitting projection <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The fitting projection <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is provided with a bolt hole <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> extending therethrough along its central axis and being contiguous to the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed through the boss-shaped projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are assembled together, the fitting projection <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is forcedly press-fitting into the guide part <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> so that the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to each other. In this state, the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is inserted through the bolt hole <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and thread-engaged with the tapped hole <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The head of the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is engaged or held in abutting contact with the bottom surface of the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by tightening the fixing screw (bolt) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, a relatively large fastening force acts between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are moved to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Like the aforementioned embodiments, the engine mount <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> has the structural feature that the interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is not exposed to the external area, but exposed to within the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the outer circumferential surface of the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. This structural feature makes it possible to effectively prevent undesirable leakage of the fluid through the interface between the abutting surfaces of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. In addition, the force generated by tightening the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> directly acts between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the direction in which these two members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are superposed on each other. This arrangement permits that the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are bonded together with a sufficiently large bonding force or strength. Therefore it is possible in the present embodiment to dispose and compress a sealing rubber layer by and between the two members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, as needed, thus assuring an excellent fluid-tight sealing at the interface between the abutting surfaces of the two inner metal members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, with ease and efficiency. Moreover, the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for use in fastening the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is independent of the mounting bolt for use in attaching the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the power unit. For this reasons, the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is less likely to be affected by input vibrational load, and can be designed to generate a desired fastening force. Thus, the engine mount <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of this embodiment can exhibit an excellent fluid-tight sealing in an effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is shown a principle part of an engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> for use in an automotive vehicle constructed according to a fourth embodiment of a fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention. In this engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed in the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a thickness larger than that of the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends axially upwardly so as to be close to the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the boss-shaped projection <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment the fixing shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a communication passage <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> as a narrow passage. This communication passage <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> extends in the radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is open at one end in the circumferential surface of the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at an axial position adjacent to the top wall of the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and at the other end in the outer circumferential surface of the fitting guide protrusion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. That is, the interface between abutting surfaces of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is held in communication with the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through the communication passage <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes an injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> axially straightly extending through a partition between the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment constructed as described above, can exhibit the same effects as described above with respect to the first embodiment. Moreover, the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed in the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a fluid-filled area in the form of the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> through the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in the present embodiment. This arrangement makes it possible to easily fill the fluid-filled area with the non-compressible fluid by injecting the non-compressible fluid through the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, after the execution of a vacuum suction or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is also directly connected to the interface between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the communication passage <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, making it possible to eliminate or remove the air remained in the interface is an effective manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for pouring the non-compressible fluid into the fluid-filled area may have a diameter as small as possible, and the opening of the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is fluid-tightly closed by a blind rivet or other suitable sealing members. Thus, the engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment can establish a high fluid-tight sealing thereof with ease. When the engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is installed on the vehicle, the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is fluid-tightly closed by the mounting bolt thread-engaged with the tapped hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for mounting the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the power unit of the vehicle. Therefore, the presence of the injection bore <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> does not cause the problem of leakage of the non-compressible fluid, and assures an excellent fluid-tight sealing thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the details of the illustrated embodiment, but may be otherwise modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> For instance, it is may be possible to fix the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together by only pressing the press-fitting portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the guide part <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the fixing bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, without calking the axially lower end portion of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the same reference numerals used for the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are used to designate the corresponding elements and parts of this engine mount, for the sake of simplicity of ease in understanding the structure of the engine mount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a modification of the engine mount <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the fifth embodiment, in which the fixing bolt <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is provided with an injection bore <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> extending therethrough along a central axis thereof. This modification makes it possible to pour the non-compressible fluid into the fluid-filled area of the engine mount through the injection bore <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, like in the engine mount <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> constructed according to the sixth embodiment. Like the sixth embodiment, the opening of the injection bore <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be fluid-tightly closed by a suitable sealing member <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, thus assuring an excellent fluid-tight sealing. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the same reference numerals used for the engine mount <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are used to designate the corresponding elements and parts of this engine mount, for the sake of ease in understanding the structure of the engine mount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> show another embodiment of the present invention in the form of an engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> includes the two mutually independent first and second orifice passages <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, which are tuned to different frequency ranges. Thus, the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is capable of exhibiting desired vibration damping effects with respect to vibrations having the different frequencies, on the basis of the resonance of the fluid flowing through the two orifice passages <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is further characterized in that the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a central hole <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> having a relatively large diameter, and a movable member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is disposed in the central hole <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> so as to fluid-tightly close this opening <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The movable member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> includes a rigid movable plate <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the central hole <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and an annular rubber support member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> bonded by vulcanization at its inner peripheral portion to an outer circumferential portion of the movable plate <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and at its outer peripheral portion to an inner circumferential portion of the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. That is, the movable plate <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is elastically supported by the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the rubber support member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> such that the movable plate <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is displaceable in the vertical direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> with the help of the elastic deformation of the rubber support member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. In addition, the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> further includes a metallic partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> that is interposed between the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to extend in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. This partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is fixed at its peripheral portion to the second mounting member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by calking, so that the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is fluid-tightly divided by the partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> into two parts disposed on the opposite sides of the partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Namely, the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is divided into a primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> partially defined by the elastic body <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and disposed on the upper side of the partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, and an auxiliary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> partially defined by the movable member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and disposed on the lower side of the partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is able to change its volume due to the displacement of the movable member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the auxiliary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has a wall stiffness that is made larger than that of the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. That is, the auxiliary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> needs larger pressure variation than the equilibrium chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in order to induce a given amount of volumetric change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further includes a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> extending circumferentially by a given circumferential length along a peripheral portion of the central hole <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and being open in its upper surface. The opening of the circumferential groove <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is fluid-tightly closed by the partition plate <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, thereby providing the second orifice passage <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> that is held in fluid communication at one end with the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> via the communication hole <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, and at the other end with the auxiliary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> via the communication hole <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> constructed as described above, the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the second orifice passage <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are independent of each other and can be tuned to different frequency range. For instance, the second orifice passage <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is tuned to a frequency range higher than the frequency range to which the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is tuned. As a result, the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> can exhibit the desired vibration damping effect with respect to vibrations having a plurality of frequencies or over a wide frequency range, based on resonance of the fluid flowing through the first orifice passage <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> has the substantially same structure as in the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. For this reason, the same reference numerals as used for the engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are used to designate the corresponding elements and parts of the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, and the redundant description thereof is omitted. With respect to the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, it should be noted that the a sealing rubber layer <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> integrally formed with the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is bonded to and interposed between the abutting surfaces between the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby improving a bonding strength and a fluid-tight sealing at the interface between the abutting surfaces of the elastic-body inner metal member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Further, the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is different from the engine mount <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment in that the diaphragm outer-cylindrical member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a calking part integrally formed at its axially lower end portion, and a rebound stopper <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> having a generally gate shape is bolted to the axially upper end portion of the diaphragm outer-cylindrical member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the presence of the rebound stopper <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is brought into abutting contact with the rebound stopper <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> via a rubber buffer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, upon application of a relatively large load to the engine mount <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in the rebound direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Yet further, the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be provided with a rubber buffer <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and a slope shaped guide groove <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> by way of example. The same reference numerals as used for the aforementioned first embodiment are used to designate the corresponding elements and parts of the engine mounts according to the following embodiments, and the detailed description thereof is omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Described more specifically, the rubber buffer <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is bonded to an inner peripheral portion of the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the tubular stop member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The rubber buffer <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> has an annular block shape in its entirety and extends circumferentially with a substantially constant cross sectional shape over an entire circumference of the inner peripheral portion of the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The rubber buffer <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> includes an upper abutting part <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and a lower abutting part <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that protrudes from the stop portion in the axially upper and lower directions, respectively, and a circumferential abutting part <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> disposed radially inward of the inner peripheral portion of the stop portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that integrally connects the upper and lower abutting parts <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to each other. An abutting member <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is also fixed to the first mounting member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by means of a bolt or the like. The abutting member <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is a hollow cylindrical member having an outward flange portion <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> integrally formed at its axially upper end portion. With the engine mount shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> installed on the vehicle, the upper abutting part <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is axially opposed to the outward flange portion <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> with a given spacing therebetween, while the lower abutting part <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is axially opposed to the disk shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm inner metal member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the given spacing therebetween. The upper abutting part <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is brought into abutting contact with the outward flange portion <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the abutting member <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, thereby limiting an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to each other in a bound direction, while the lower abutting part is brought into abutting contact with the disk shaped portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, thereby limiting an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to each other in a rebound direction. In addition, the circumferential abutting part <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the rubber buffer <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is brought into abutting contact with a cylindrical wall portion <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the abutting member <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to thereby limit an amount of displacement of the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to each other in a radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the first and second mounting members <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> While the guide groove <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> extends in the axial direction in the illustrated embodiment, the guide groove may otherwise be embodied. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a guide groove <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> having a sloped shape.

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated embodiments of the fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention takes the form of the engine mounts for an automotive vehicle of passive type, for the illustrative purpose only, the principle of the present invention is equally applicable to engine mounts of active type in which the pressure variation induced in the pressure-receiving chamber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is actively controlled. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows one example of an active type engine mount <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> constructed according to the present invention. The engine mount <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> includes an oscillating plate <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> disposed in a central hole <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> formed through the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and elastically supported by an annular rubber support member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> bonded by vulcanization at its inner peripheral portion to the outer circumferential surface of the oscillating plate <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and at its outer peripheral portion to inner circumferential surface of the rid-metal-plate member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, the oscillating member <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is elastically displaceable in the vertical direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> owing to the elastic deformation of the rubber support member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The oscillating plate <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> has a drive shaft <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> protruding axially downwardly from the central portion of its lower surface. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is connectable to an output shaft of a suitable actuator <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> by two-dot chain line. The actuator <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> may be desirably selected from various kinds of actuators including a pneumatic type and an electromagnetic type. In operation, the oscillating plate <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is oscillated by an actuator <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> at a frequency and a phase corresponding to that of the vibrations applied to the engine mount <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, whereby the engine mount <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> can exhibit actively controlled damping effect. It should be appreciated that the active type engine mount <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> constructed as described above according to the invention, can enjoy the same effects of the invention described above with respect to the aforesaid embodiment, likewise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated embodiments of the fluid-filled vibration-damping device of the present invention takes the form of the engine mounts for an automotive vehicle, by way of example, the principle of the present invention is equally applicable to various other types of engine mount, a body mount, a member mount for use on a motor vehicle, and other fluid-filled vibration-damping devices for use in various devices other than those for the automotive vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It is also to be understood that the present invention may be embodied with various other changes, modifications and improvements, which may occur to those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
