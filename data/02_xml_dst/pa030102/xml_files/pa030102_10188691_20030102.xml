<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A marine drive has an engine, a propeller and a transmission to switch the propeller between a propulsion position and a non-propulsion position. The engine has a combustion chamber. An air induction system communicates with the combustion chamber through an intake port.

Intake and exhaust valves move between an opening position and a closing position of the intake port and the exhaust port, respectively.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a valve timing control for a marine drive, and more particularly to an improved valve timing control for a marine drive that includes a variable valve timing mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A marine drive such as an outboard motor has a marine propulsion device powered by an engine. The propulsion device typically is a propeller and is submerged when an associated watercraft rests on a body of water. The outboard motor can employ either a two-cycle engine or a four-cycle engine. Recently, however, many outboard motors are offered with four-cycle engines because they provide better emissions control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typically, a four-cycle engine includes one or more intake and exhaust valves moving between an open position and a closed position. One or more camshafts can be provided to actuate the valves in a timed manner. When the intake valves are open, air is introduced into combustion chambers of the engine through the intake ports. When the exhaust valves are open, exhaust gases are discharged from the combustion chambers through the exhaust ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The engine typically includes one or more throttle valves to regulate an amount of air delivered to the combustion chambers. The throttle valves can be operated by the operator with a throttle lever. In general, the more the throttle valves open, the more power is output from the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The engine can include a hydraulically operated variable valve timing (VVT) mechanism that can change opening and closing timing of the respective valves by changing an angular position of the camshaft or camshafts. A control device such as, for example, an electronic control unit (ECU) is used to control the VVT mechanism under various control strategies. For instance, the ECU controls the VVT mechanism either to set the valve timing at a fully advanced position for relatively high engine speeds to ensure high charging efficiency and high performance of the engine, or to set the valve timing at a fully retarded position for relatively low engine speeds to ensure high combustion efficiency, fuel economy and good emission control. Otherwise, the ECU controls the VVT mechanism to set the valve timing at a position between the fully advanced position and the fully retarded position in response to a running condition of the engine. Typically, the control by the ECU is a feedback control such that the ECU gives a target valve timing and controls the VVT mechanism to bring an actual valve timing close to the target valve timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Typically, the marine drive is provided with a transmission or transmission that changes a rotational direction of the propeller between forward, neutral or reverse. The transmission typically comprises a dog clutch and shift unit that operates the dog clutch. When in the forward and reverse positions, which are propulsion positions, the propeller propels the watercraft forward and backward, respectively. In the neutral position, which is a non-propulsion position, the propeller does not propel the watercraft because the propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is disconnected from the driveshaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When an engine is operating at idle speed with minimal load, it can exert considerable torque without movement of the throttle valve. For example, when a marine drive such as an outboard or inboard/outboard motor is at idle speed, the power output of the engine makes it difficult to move the transmission shift lever due to the load imparted to the transmission components. Additionally, when the transmission is shifted to a drive position, the engine is suddenly loaded and causes the propeller to begin to rotate almost instantaneously. The sudden movement of the propeller sends a shock through the drive train. This shock causes fatigue in the drive train and can make passengers in the associated watercraft feel uncomfortable. The shock is more severe and more noticeable when the marine drive is powered by a four-cycle engine. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention includes the realization that although variable valve timing mechanisms can be used to enhance the efficiency and thus increase the power output of internal combusion engines, they can also be used to reduce the power output of an engine. For example, in one mode, a VVT mechanism can be adjusted to an advanced intake valve timing during idle speed operation to reduce the power output and speed of the engine. As such, the load on the transmission can be reduced thereby allowing the transmission to be shifted more easily. Additionally, the reduced power output of the engine reduces the shock imparted to the drive train and the passengers of the associated watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention includes the realization that, under certain conditions, it is more beneficial to prevent adjustment of the valve timing. For example, sometimes a user may find it necessary or desirable to &ldquo;race&rdquo; the engine while the transmission is in the neutral position. In other words, a user may choose to actuate the throttle to increase the engine speed without causing the associated watercraft to move. A user might choose to race the engine in this manner to warm the engine more quickly, to un-foul a spark plug, to determine if a cylinder is mis-firing, or other reasons. Normally, the VVT mechanism would adjust the valve timing to follow a target timing when an engine is raced as such. However, if the valve timing is adjusted normally while the transmission is in neutral, the VVT mechanism may not be able to achieve a desired angular position immediately when the transmission is shifted into a drive position. Thus, a time lag can be generated causing the engine to temporarily operate in a compromised condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a marine drive comprises an internal combustion engine. A propulsion device is powered by the engine. A transmission is arranged to switch the propulsion device between a propulsion position and a non-propulsion position. The engine comprises an engine body. A movable member is movable relative to the engine body. The engine body and the movable member together define a combustion chamber.

A sensor senses that the transmission is under operation and sending a signal to the control device. The control device controls the change mechanism based upon the signal to move the actuating timing away from the optimum timing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an overall construction of an outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that employs an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> configured in accordance with certain features, aspects and advantages of the present invention is described below. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has particular utility in the context of a marine drive, such as the outboard motor, and thus is described in the context of an outboard motor. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, however, can be used with other types of marine drives (i.e., inboard motors, inboard/outboard motors, jet drives, etc.) and also certain land vehicles. In any of these applications, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be oriented vertically or horizontally. Furthermore, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be used as a stationary engine for some applications that will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated arrangement, the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally comprises a drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> supports the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on a transom <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of an associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and places a marine propulsion device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a submerged position when the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rests on a surface of a body of water WL. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a steering shaft and a pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The steering shaft typically extends through the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is affixed to the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by top and bottom mount assemblies <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The steering shaft is pivotally journaled for steering movement about a generally vertically extending steering axis defined within the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of bracket arms that are spaced apart from each other and that are affixed to the watercraft transom <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> completes a hinge coupling between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends through the bracket arms so that the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> supports the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement about a generally horizontally extending tilt axis defined by the pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thus can be tilted or trimmed about the pivot pin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As used through this description, the terms &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;forwardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;front&rdquo; mean at or to the side where the bracket assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is located, and the terms &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;reverse,&rdquo; &ldquo;backwardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;rearwardly&rdquo; mean at or to the opposite side of the front side, unless indicated otherwise or otherwise readily apparent from the context use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A hydraulic tilt and trim adjustment system <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> preferably is provided between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for tilt movement (raising or lowering) of the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can have a manually operated system for tilting the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Typically, the term &ldquo;tilt movement&rdquo;, when used in a broad sense, comprises both a tilt movement and a trim adjustment movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The illustrated drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comprises a power head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a housing unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which includes a driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The power head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed atop the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and includes the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the protective cowling <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which preferably is made of plastic, defines a generally closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) in which the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed. The protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably is detachably affixed to the bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by a coupling mechanism so that a user, operator, mechanic or repairperson can access the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for maintenance or for other purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has a rear intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on its rear and top portion. A rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with a rear air duct <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is affixed to the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, together with the rear top portion of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, forms a rear air intake space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rear air duct <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed to the starboard side of a central portion of the rear intake member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also defines a recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at a front end thereof. An opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is defined along a portion of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the starboard side. The opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> extends into the interior of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. An outer shell <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is disposed over the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to define a front air intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A front air duct <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is affixed to the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and extends upward from the opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the air flow path into the closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can include an elevated entrance from the front air intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The air duct <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> preferably has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, each of which preferably is cylindrical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A front intake opening (not shown) preferably is defined between the recessed portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the top cowling member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the outer shell <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> so that the front intake space <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> communicates with outside of the cowling assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Ambient air thus is drawn into the closed cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through the rear intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or the front intake opening (not shown) and further through the air ducts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Typically, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> tapers in girth toward its top surface, which is in the general proximity of the air intake opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> preferably has an opening <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) through which an upper portion of an exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) extends. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> preferably is made of aluminum alloy and is affixed atop the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> together generally form a tray. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is placed onto this tray and is affixed to the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> also has an exhaust passage through which burnt charges (e.g., exhaust gases) from the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment preferably operates on a four-cycle combustion principle. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The presently preferred cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defines four in-line cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which extend generally horizontally and which are generally vertically spaced from one another. As used in this description, the term &ldquo;horizontally&rdquo; means that the subject portions, members or components extend generally in parallel to the water line WL when the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially stationary with respect to the water line WL and when the drive unit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not tilted and is placed in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The term &ldquo;vertically&rdquo; in turn means that portions, members or components extend generally normal to those that extend horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This type of engine, however, merely exemplifies one type of engine on which various aspects and features of the present invention can be suitably used. Engines having other numbers of cylinders, having other cylinder arrangements (V, opposing, etc.), and operating on other combustion principles (e.g., crankcase compression two-stroke or rotary) also can employ various features, aspects and advantages of the present invention. In addition, the engine can be formed with separate cylinder bodies rather than a number of cylinder bores formed in a cylinder block. Regardless of the particular construction, the engine preferably comprises an engine body that includes at least one cylinder bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A moveable member, such as a reciprocating piston <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, moves relative to the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a suitable manner. In the illustrated arrangement, the piston <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reciprocates within each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is affixed to one end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to close one end of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, together with the associated pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, preferably defines four combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Of course, the number of combustion chambers can vary, as indicated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> closes the other end of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and, together with the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, defines a crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft or output shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically through the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and can be journaled for rotation by several bearing blocks (not shown). Connecting rods <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> couple the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> with the respective pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner. Thus, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can rotate with the reciprocal movement of the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is located at the forward most position of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> being disposed rearward from the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Generally, the cylinder block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (or individual cylinder bodies), the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> together define an engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Preferably, at least these major engine portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are made of an aluminum alloy. The aluminum alloy advantageously increases strength over cast iron while decreasing the weight of the engine body <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also comprises an air induction system or device <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> draws air from within the cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably comprises eight intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, four intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a single plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated arrangement, two intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are allotted to each combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the two intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> communicate with a single intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are slidably disposed at the intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> within the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to move between an open and a closed position. As such, the valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> act to open and close the ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to control the flow of air into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Biasing members, such as springs <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), are used to urge the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> toward the respective closed positions by acting against a mounting boss formed on the illustrated cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a corresponding retainer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> that is affixed to each of the valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. When each intake valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is in the open position, the intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is associated with the intake port <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> communicates with the associated combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> preferably is defined by an intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and an intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> preferably are made of aluminum alloy. The intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> preferably is made of plastic. A portion of the illustrated intake runner <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extends forwardly alongside of and to the front of the crankcase member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the respective portions of the intake runners <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, together with a plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, define the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> also is made of plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> comprises an air inlet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The air in the cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is drawn into the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through the air inlet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The air is then passed through intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the intake manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> acts as an intake silencer to attenuate noise generated by the flow of air into the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Each illustrated throttle body <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> has a butterfly type throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> journaled for pivotal movement about an axis defined by a generally vertically extending valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Each valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be coupled with the other valve shafts to allow simultaneous movement. The valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is operable by the operator through an appropriate conventional throttle valve linkage and a throttle lever connected to the end of the linkage. The throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are movable between an open position and a closed position to meter or regulate an amount of air flowing through the respective air intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Normally, the greater the opening degree, the higher the rate of airflow and the higher the power output of the engine speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In order to bring the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to idle speed and to maintain this speed, the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> generally are substantially closed. Preferably, the valves are not fully closed to produce a more stable idle speed and to prevent sticking of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in the closed position. As used through the description, the term &ldquo;idle speed&rdquo; generally means a low engine speed that achieved when the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are closed but also includes a state such that the valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are slightly more open to allow a relatively small amount of air to flow through the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably includes an auxiliary air device (AAD) (not shown) that bypasses the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and extends from the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> downstream of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Idle air can be delivered to the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the AAD when the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are placed in a substantially closed or closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The AAD preferably comprises an idle air passage, an idle valve and an idle valve actuator. The idle air passage is branched off to the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The idle valve controls flow through the idle air passage such that the amount of air flow can be more precisely controlled. Preferably, the idle valve is a needle valve that can move between an open position and a closed position, which closes the idle air passage. The idle valve actuator actuates the idle valve to a certain position to meter or adjust an amount of the idle air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also comprises an exhaust system that routes burnt charges, i.e., exhaust gases, to a location outside of the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preferably has two exhaust ports (not shown) defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The exhaust ports can be selectively opened and closed by exhaust valves. The exhaust valves are schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, described below, and identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The construction of each exhaust valve and the arrangement of the exhaust valves are substantially the same as the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the arrangement thereof, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An exhaust manifold (not shown) preferably is disposed next to the exhaust ports (not shown) and extends generally vertically. The exhaust manifold communicates with the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the exhaust ports to collect exhaust gases therefrom. The exhaust manifold is coupled with the foregoing exhaust passage of the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. When the exhaust ports are opened, the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicate with the exhaust passage through the exhaust manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a valve cam mechanism or valve actuator <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> preferably is provided for actuating the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). In the illustrated arrangement, the valve cam mechanism <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes an intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and an exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> both extending generally vertically and journaled for rotation relative to the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated arrangement, bearing caps <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) journal the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> with the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> is affixed to the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to define a camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> together with the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Each camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, has cam lobes <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to push valve lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> that are affixed to the respective ends of the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) as in any suitable manner. The cam lobes <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> repeatedly push the valve lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in a timed manner, which is in proportion to the engine speed. The movement of the lifters <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> generally is timed by the rotation of the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to actuate the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> camshaft drive mechanism <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> drives the valve cam mechanism <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> include an intake driven sprocket <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> positioned atop the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and an exhaust driven sprocket <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> positioned atop the exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has a drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> positioned at an upper portion thereof. Of course, other locations of the sprockets also can be used. The illustrated arrangement, however, advantageously results in a compactly arranged engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A timing chain or belt <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is wound around the driven sprockets <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> thus drives the respective camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through the timing chain <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> in the timed relationship. Because the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> must rotate at half of the speed of the rotation of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the four-cycle combustion principle, a diameter of the driven sprockets <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is twice as large as a diameter of the drive sprocket <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably has a port or manifold fuel injection system. The fuel injection system preferably comprises four fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> with one fuel injector allotted for each of the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through suitable fuel conduits <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>. The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are mounted on a fuel rail <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The fuel rail <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also defines a portion of the fuel conduits <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight>. Each fuel injector <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> preferably has an injection nozzle directed toward the associated intake passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> adjacent to the intake ports <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> spray fuel into the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> under control of an ECU which preferably is mounted on the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at an appropriate location. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) controls both the start timing and the duration of the fuel injection cycle of the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> so that the nozzles spray a proper amount of the fuel for each combustion cycle. The fuel injection controller within the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> with reference numeral <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and is described below. Of course, the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> can be disposed for direct cylinder injection and carburetors can replace or accompany the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further comprises an ignition or firing system. Each combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with a spark plug <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> that is connected to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) through an igniter so that ignition timing is also controlled by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Each spark plug <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has electrodes that are exposed into the associated combustion chamber and are spaced apart from each other with a small gap. The spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> generate a spark between the electrodes to ignite an air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at selected ignition timing under control of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reciprocate between top dead center and bottom dead center. When the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> makes two rotations, the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> generally move from the top dead center to the bottom dead center (the intake stroke), from the bottom dead center to the top dead center (the compression stroke), from the top dead center to the bottom dead center (the power stroke) and from the bottom dead center to the top dead center (the exhaust stroke). During the four strokes of the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the camshafts <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> make one rotation and actuate the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valves <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to open the intake ports <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> during the intake stroke and to open exhaust ports during the exhaust stroke, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Generally, during the intake stroke, air is drawn into the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the air intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and fuel is injected into the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The air and the fuel thus are mixed to form the air/fuel charge in the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Slightly before or during the power stroke, the respective spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> ignite the compressed air/fuel charge in the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air/fuel charge thus rapidly burns during the power stroke to move the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The burnt charge, i.e., exhaust gases, then are discharged from the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during the exhaust stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> During engine operation, heat builds in the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The illustrated engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thus includes a cooling system to cool the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably employs an open-loop type water cooling system that introduces cooling water from the body of water surrounding the motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and then discharges the water to the body of water. The cooling system includes one or more water jackets defined within the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> through which the water travels to remove heat from the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a lubrication system. A closed-loop type system is employed in the illustrated embodiment. The lubrication system comprises a lubricant tank defining a reservoir, which preferably is positioned within the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An oil pump (not shown) is provided at a desired location, such as atop the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, to pressurize the lubricant oil in the reservoir and to pass the lubricant oil through a suction pipe toward certain engine portions, which desirably are lubricated, through lubricant delivery passages. The engine portions that need lubrication include, for example, the crankshaft bearings (not shown), the connecting rods <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the pistons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Portions <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the delivery passages (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) can be defined in the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Lubricant return passages (not shown) also are provided to return the oil to the lubricant tank for re-circulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) preferably is positioned at an upper end of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and is mounted for rotation with the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> comprises a flywheel magneto or AC generator that supplies electric power to various electrical components such as the fuel injection system, the ignition system and the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). A protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which preferably is made of plastic, extends over majority of the top surface of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and preferably covers the portion that includes the fly wheel assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the camshaft drive mechanism <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> preferably has a rib <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that reduces or eliminates the amount of air flowing directly toward the engine portion that has the air induction system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, i.e., to the portion on the starboard side. The protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> also preferably has a rib <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) that substantially or completely inhibits air from flowing directly toward a front portion of the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> advantageously help direct the airflow around the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to cool the engine body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> bottom portion, at least in part, of the protective cover <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> desirably is left open to allow heat to radiate from the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> depends from the power head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to support a driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> which is coupled with the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and which extends generally vertically through the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is journaled for rotation and is driven by the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> preferably defines an internal section of the exhaust system that leads the majority of exhaust gases to the lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. An idle discharge section is branched off from the internal section to discharge idle exhaust gases directly out to the atmosphere through a discharge port that is formed on a rear surface of the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in idle speed of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> preferably drives the oil pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> depends from the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and supports a propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> that is driven by the driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> extends generally horizontally through the lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is journaled for rotation. The propulsion device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is attached to the propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated arrangement, the propulsion device includes a propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that is affixed to an outer end of the propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The propulsion device, however, can take the form of a dual counter-rotating system, a hydrodynamic jet, or any of a number of other suitable propulsion devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> preferably is provided between the driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, which lie generally normal to each other (i.e., at a 90&deg; shaft angle) to couple together the two shafts <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> by bevel gears. The transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> includes a transmission (not shown) that changes a rotational direction of the propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> among forward, neutral or reverse. The transmission typically comprises a dog clutch and shift units that operate the dog clutch. At the forward and reverse positions, which are propulsion positions, the propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> propels the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forward and backward, respectively. At the neutral position, which is a-non-propulsion position, the propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> does not propel the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> because the propulsion shaft <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is disconnected from the driveshaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the transmission is interconnected with the throttle valve linkage. A single control lever, which is the foregoing throttle lever, is connected with not only the throttle valve but also the transmission to control both of them in an interrelationship such that the throttle valve is always closed (or almost closed) when the transmission is placed in the neutral position by the transmission except for a racing operation. The throttle linkage can be released from the transmission for the racing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The lower unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also defines an internal section of the exhaust system that is connected with the internal section of the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At engine speeds above idle, the exhaust gases generally are discharged to the body of water surrounding the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the internal sections and then a discharge section defined within the hub of the propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> preferably is configured to adjust the angular position of the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> relative to the intake driven sprocket <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> between two limits, i.e., a fully advanced angular position and a fully retarded angular position. At the fully advanced angular position, the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> opens and closes the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at a most advanced timing. In contrast, at the fully retarded angular position, the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> opens and closes the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at a most retarded timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> preferably is hydraulically operated and thus comprises an adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, a fluid supply section <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and a control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> sets the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to the certain angular position in response to a volume of working fluid that is allotted to two spaces of the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The fluid supply section <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> preferably supplies a portion of the lubricant, which is used primarily for the lubrication system, to the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as the working fluid. The control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> selects the rate or amount of the fluid directed to the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> under control of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> preferably extend radially and are spaced apart from each other with an angle of about <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> degrees. The two sides of the vane <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, together with walls <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of each chamber <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, define a first space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. Seal members <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> carried by the respective vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> abuts an inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and thereby substantially seal the first and second spaces S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from each other. The walls <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of each chamber <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> also define stoppers which the vane <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> comes in contact with or abut on when a valve timing is set at either fully advanced or fully retarded position as described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The respective first spaces S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> communicate with one another through respective pathways <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and a passage <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> that is formed on an upper surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and extends partially around the bolt <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The respective second spaces S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> communicate with one another through pathways <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> and a passage <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> which is formed on a lower surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and extends partially around the bolt <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The passages <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> generally are configured as an incomplete circular shape and can be offset from one another (e.g., a 60 degree offset may be used). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A pathway <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> extends from the passage <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> to a bottom portion of the rotor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> between the ends of the passage <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. A cover member <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is affixed to the outer housing <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> to cover the bolt <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The passages <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> allow fluid communication with the respective pathways <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> during rotation of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, the fluid supply section <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> preferably includes a supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and two delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. The supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> communicate with one another through the control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A seal member <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is inserted between the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the bearing cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to inhibit the lubricant from leaking out. It should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in a schematic fashion. The passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> do not merge together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> preferably includes an oil control valve (OCV) <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> comprises a housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and a cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Both the housing and cylinder sections <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> preferably are received in the bearing cap <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Because the sections <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> together extend through a hole of the camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, a bellow <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> made of rubber is provided between the housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the camshaft cover <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> to close and seal the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> defines the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that communicates with the supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. The housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> preferably encloses a solenoid type actuator, although other actuators of course are available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> extends into the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from the actuator and is axially movable therein. The rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> has a pair of valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and a pair of guide portions <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and the guide portions <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> have an outer diameter that is larger than an outer diameter of the remainder portions <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and is generally equal to an inner diameter of the cylinder section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> defines an internal passage <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> extending through the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> communicating with the passage <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to allow free flow of the lubricant in the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> A coil spring <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is retained in a spring retaining space <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> at an end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> opposite to the housing section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to urge the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> toward the actuator. The lubricant can be drained to the camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> through the spring retaining chamber <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> and a drain hole <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The actuator, i.e., solenoid, actuates the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> under control of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) so that the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> can take any position in the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the solenoid pushes the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> toward a position in compliance with commands of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. If a certain position designated by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is closer to the solenoid than a current position, then the solenoid does not actuate the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and the coil spring <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> pushes back the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to the desired position. Alternatively, the solenoid pulls the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> back to the position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The valve <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> can close the port <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> entirely or partially, and the valve <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> can close the port <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> entirely or partially. The extent to which the valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> allow the ports <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to communicate with the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> determines an amount of the lubricant that is allotted to each delivery passage <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> and to each space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The amount of lubricant delivered to each space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thus determines an angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. If more lubricant is allotted to the first space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> than to the second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is adjusted closer to the fully advanced position, and vise versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In operation, the oil pump pressurizes the lubricant oil to the supply passage <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and further to the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) controls the solenoid. The solenoid moves the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and thus adjusts the degree to which the valves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> allow the chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to communicate with the ports <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, respectively. The ECU thereby controls the angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a drain is provided to allow the lubricant oil to drain from the space that is being evacuated while pressurized lubricant oil flows into the opposing space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In one mode of operation, for example, the lubricant oil is fed to the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Thus, the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has a positive pressure. To move the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in a first direction relative to the input sprocket <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is linked with the delivery passage <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> while the other of the delivery passage <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> is linked to a drain. Thus, pressurized oil will flow into the first space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while oil will be displaced from the second space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The displaced oil flows through the passage <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> and to the drain <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and thereby returns to the lubrication system. Once the desired movement has occurred, the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is returned to a neutral position in which the common chamber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is no longer communicating with either of the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. Additionally, in the neutral position, neither of the delivery passages <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> communicates with the drain in one particularly advantageous arrangement. Of course, by varying the placement and size of the seals, a constant flow can be produced from supply to drain while the rod <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is in a neutral position. Also, a constant flow into the delivery lines also can be constructed. In the illustrated arrangement, however, no flow preferably occurs with the system in a neutral position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> valve timing control system of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> will now be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically illustrates the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The illustrated ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> controls the valve timing of the intake valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> by changing the angular positions of the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> through the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> also controls the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> using the fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as the control section <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and to the fuel injectors through control signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In order to control the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, the ECU can employ various sensors, which sense operational conditions of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the present system, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at least uses a camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, a crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, a throttle position sensor (or throttle valve opening degree sensor) <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and an intake or manifold air pressure sensor (MAP) <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to the sensors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> through sensor signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is configured to sense an angular position of the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and to send an actual camshaft angular position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. The crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is configured to sense an angular position of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and to send a crankshaft angular position signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. Both the camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> in the present system can be configured to generate pulses as the respective signals. The pulse of the camshaft position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> can give an actual angular position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft position signal together with the camshaft position signal allows the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to determine the position of the camshaft <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in relation to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed atop the valve shaft <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and is configured to sense an angular position between the open and closed angular positions of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and to send a throttle valve opening degree signal to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The MAP sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed either within one of the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or within the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and is configured to sense an intake pressure therein. Because the respective intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are formed such that each generally is the same size as the others, and because the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> collects a large volume of air that is supplied to each of the intake passages <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, every passage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has substantially equal pressure and a signal of the MAP sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> thus can represent a condition of the respective pressures. Thus, it should be appreciated that a single pressure sensor or multiple pressure sensors can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The throttle valve position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the MAP sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> preferably are selected from a type of sensor that indirectly senses an amount of air in the induction system. Another type of sensor that directly senses the air amount, of course, can be applicable. For example, moving vane types, heated-wire types and Karman Vortex types of air flow meters also can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The operator&apos;s demand or engine load, as determined by the throttle opening degree, is sensed by the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Generally, in proportion to the change of the throttle opening degree, the intake air pressure also varies and is sensed by the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is opened when the operator operates the throttle lever to increase power output of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and thus the speed of the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The intake pressure almost simultaneously decreases at the throttle valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> opens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The engine load can also increase when the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> advances against wind. In this situation, the operator also operates the throttle lever to recover the speed that may be lost. Therefore, as used in this description, the term &ldquo;acceleration&rdquo; means not only the acceleration in the narrow sense but also the recovery of speed by the operator in a broad sense. Also, the term &ldquo;sudden acceleration&rdquo; means the sudden acceleration in the narrow sense and a quick recovery of speed by the operator in a broad sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The signal lines preferably are configured with hard-wires or wireharnesses. The signals can be sent through emitter and detector pairs, infrared radiation, radio waves or the like. The type of signal and the type of connection can be varied between sensors or the same type can be used with all sensors which are described above and additional sensors described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Signals from other sensors or control signals also can be used for the control by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In the present control system, various sensors other than the sensors described above are also provided to sense the operational condition of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, an oil pressure sensor <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, a water temperature sensor <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, an engine body temperature sensor <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, a knock sensor <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>, an oxygen sensor <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> for determining a current air/fuel ratio, and an intake air temperature sensor <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> are provided in the present control system. The sensors can sense the operational conditions of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and send signals to the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through respective sensor signal lines. An ignition control signal <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, a fuel injection control signal <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, and an AAD control signal <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> are also used by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for control of the spark plugs <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, and the AAD (not shown), respectively. The foregoing sensors <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and the control signals <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, in a broad sense, define sensors <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> that sense operational conditions of the engine and/or the outboard motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be designed as a feedback control device using the signals of the sensors. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably has a central processing unit (CPU) and at elast one storage unit for storing various control maps defining relationships between parameters such as, for example, the engine speed, the throttle valve position and the intake pressure (and/or an amount of intake air) to determine desired control conditions. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> then controls the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and other actuators in accordance with the determined control condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The fuel injection control unit or &ldquo;module&rdquo; <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a hard-wired circuit, a dedicated processor and memory, or a general purpose processor and memery running a control program. Other units or &ldquo;modules&rdquo;, described below, can also be constructed as a hard-wired circuit, a dedicated processor and memory, or a general purpose processor and memery running one or more control programs. However, for easier understanding of the reader, the units will be described as if they were discriminate and substantial units. The illustrated fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> controls the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> using at least the throttle position signal from the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the intake pressure signal from the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably comprises, other than the fuel injection control unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, an actual camshaft angular position calculation (ACAPC) unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, an engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, a target camshaft angular position calculation (TCAPC) unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, and a control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> and the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> together form an OCV control section <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> in the illustrated ECU configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> preferably receives the actual camshaft angular position signal from the camshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the crankshaft angular position signal, which gives two possible ranges of camshaft angular position, from the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. The ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> then calculates a deviation value which indicates how much the actual camshaft angular position deviates within the two possible ranges of camshaft angular position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> receives the crankshaft angular position signal from the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and calculates an engine speed using the signal versus time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> receives the deviation value from the ACAPC unit <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, the engine speed from the engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> and at least one of the throttle valve opening degree signal from the throttle valve position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the intake pressure signal from the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> then calculates a target camshaft angular position based upon the deviation value, the engine speed and either the throttle valve opening degree signal or the intake pressure signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> receives the target camshaft angular position from the TCAPC unit <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> and calculates a control value of the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. That is, the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> determines how much fluid should be delivered to either the space S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the space S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the adjusting section <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> based upon the target camshaft angular position. Generally, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sets the valve timing at the fully retarded position at least when the engine speed is relatively slow (under idle and trolling condition) to provide enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the timing can be retarded at speeds nearing the upper engine speed limit. For example, the timing can be retarded as speeds less than 800 rpm (at idle, 700-800 rpm, and at trolling, 650-750 rpm) and at speeds of more than 6,000 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Under a normal running condition and an ordinary acceleration condition (i.e., not sudden acceleration condition), the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably uses either a combination of the throttle valve opening degree signal with the engine speed signal (&agr;-N method) or a combination of the intake pressure signal with the engine speed signal (D<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>method) to calculate the target camshaft angular position. Otherwise, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can use a mixed combination of the &agr;-N method and the D-j method under the normal running condition or the ordinary acceleration condition. The &agr;-N method, the D-j method and the mixed combination thereof are disclosed in, for example, a co-pending U.S. application filed Feb. 14, 2002, titled CONTROL SYSTEM FOR MARINE ENGINE, which Ser. No. 10/078,275, the entire contents of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. An air amount signal sensed by the air flow meter noted above can be applied additionally or instead either the intake pressure signal or the throttle opening degree signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Under a sudden acceleration condition, the illustrated ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> uses only the throttle opening degree signal. That is, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> always determines, at least prior to controlling the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> with the OCV control section <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, whether the operator wishes sudden acceleration or not. The sudden acceleration condition preferably is determined when a change rate of the throttle opening degree signal, a change rate of the intake pressure signal or a change rate of the engine speed calculated by the engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> becomes greater than a predetermined magnitude. A change rate of the air amount signal also can be used to determine the sudden acceleration condition. Theoretically, the predetermined magnitude can be set at any magnitude larger than zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce shock, make the transmission easier to shift, and to reduce the time lag generated when the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been raced with the transmission in a neutral position, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in the present control system employs a control strategy, an illustrative example of which is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> A presently preferred control system is schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The system includes a control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that adjusts an output of the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, a transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and a transmission position change operation sensor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is configured to sense whether the transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is in the forward, neutral or reverse position. The transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is also configured to send a transmission position signal to the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> through the signal line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The transmission position change operation sensor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> senses a transitional condition under which the transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is operated to change to the forward, neutral or reverse position from another position by the operator and sends a transmission position change operation signal to the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> through the signal line. The transmission position change operation sensor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can comprise, for example, but without limitatio, a torsion torque sensor disposed at a node portion of a shift linkage of the transmission. The torsion torque sensor can send the transmission position change operation signal when a torsion torque of the node portion exceeds a preset torque. This situation occurs when the transmission cannot be changed to the neutral position from the forward or reverse positions. Alternatively, a load sensor can be disposed on a shift cable of the mechanism. The load sensor can detect a change of load when the transmission is operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Both the torsion torque sensor and the load sensor are configured to sense if the operational load exerted upon a portion of the transmission exceeds a preset magnitude. Alternatively, a proximity sensor unit comprising a magnet disposed on a portion of the transmission and a reed switch disposed adjacent to the magnet can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the illustrated ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> uses the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> as a sensor which senses an operational condition of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> preferably is configured to determine whether the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is operating in a low speed based on the throttle opening degree sensed by the sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, e.g. when the opening degree is less than a preset magnitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can use other sensors solely or in combination with the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> as a sensor which senses the operational condition of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, the air amount sensor (not shown) and the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> are applicable. This is because the crankshaft angle position sensor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> can give an engine speed together with the engine speed calculation unit <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, and the intake pressure sensor <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and the air amount sensor can give a value generally in proportion to the engine speed, like the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> schematically illustrates an exemplary flow chart of a control routine used by the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the tranmission position is determined. For example, ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can sample or &ldquo;read&rdquo; the output of the the transmission position sensor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. After the step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the routine proceeds to a step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the transmission <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is in the neutral position. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can compare the output read in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a predetermined value corresponding to the neutral position. If the transmission is in the neutral position, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a throttle opening degree is determined. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can sample the output of the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. After the step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the throttle opening degree is less than a predetermined degree &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, for example, one (1) degree. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can compare the output read in the step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the predetermined output value &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can determine if the throttle opening degree is zero. an affirmative determination means that the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is operating under an idle speed mode. After the step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the routing moves to a step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As the step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is operated according to an idle speed mode. In this mode, the engine speed is about 700-800 rpm, as described above. Additionally, the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to fix the camshaft angular timing at the fully retarded position. Preferably, a sufficient fluid amount, i.e., more than an ordinary amount of the fluid, is delivered to the spaces S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This amount of fluid is sufficient to press the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> against the stoppers <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> such that the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> cannot vibrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> If, at the step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the determination is negative, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is operating in a racing mode. Thus, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the camshaft timing is adjusted to the fully retarded position. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can send a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to fix the camshaft angular timing at the fully retarded position, regardless of engine speed. This is advantageous because the valve timing can be kept at the fully retarded position which will be the desired valve timing at the moment the transmission is shifted into a drive position. Normally, adjustment of the valve timing is not necessary in the racing mode since the transmission is in a neutral position and thus, the load on the engine remains low. Thus, the fully retarded position is satisfactory for the racing mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that pressing the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to the stoppers <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is not necessary. For example, the time lag will be prevented as along as the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are brought into contact with or at least adjacent to the stoppers <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, however, the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, at the step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, can allow the output of the control value of the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> to be sent to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Under this alternative control, the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> sets the camshaft angular timing at a position between the fully retarded and fully advanced position given by the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> according to engine speed and/or load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in another alternative, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can immediately fix the VVT mechanism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the fully retarded position when the determination at the step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is affirmative without determining whether the throttle opening degree is less than the preset degree &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> With reference to the step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, if the determination at this step is negative, the program moves to a step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a transmission position change operation is detected. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can sample the output of the using the transmission position change operation sensor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. After the step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the transmission is being shifted. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can compare the output sampled in the step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a predetermined value indicative of the shifting of the transmission. The predetermined values indicate that the transmission is being shifted into forward, neutral or reverse. If this determination is affirmative, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> At the step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the camshaft timing is adjusted to an advanced timing relative to the fully retarded timing. Preferably, the camshaft timing is set to a timing that lowers the power output of the engine so as to reduce the load on the tansmission components, which thereby makes it easier to shift the transmission and reduces the shock imparted to the drive train. Additionally, the camshaft timing is set such that the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not stall. However, it is to be noted that the time during which the camshaft timing is set to the advanced position can be short. Thus, the camshaft timing can be set to such an advanced timing that the engein would eventually reach an unacceptably unstable state if such a timing was maintained for longer than the duration of the step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As an example of the operation performed during the step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the illustrated control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, can send a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to set the camshaft angular timing to more advanced timing rather than a more optimum timing originally determined by the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In an illustrative, but non-limiting example, the total angular range between the fully retarded position and the fully advanced position is 40 degrees. Thus, the advance angle set in step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably is 10 degrees from the fully retarded position. With this timing advancement, the engine begins to run in an unstable state, but continues to run, at least during the duration of step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This unstable running condition produces a lower torque than that produced during normal idle speed operation. Thus, the operator can more easily operate the transmission with less effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, if the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sets the camshaft angular position to the fully advanced position or a relatively advanced position in some controls, and the engine operation is stable and the torque is large at this position, the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, at the step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, can send a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to set the camshaft angular timing to more retarded, and less optimal, position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> If the determination at the step S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is negative, the program goes to a step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. At the step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the trottle opening is detected. For example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can sample the output from the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. After the step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> At the step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the throttle position detected in the step S<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is less than a preset magnitude &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(for example, three (3) degrees). The opening degree &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be the same as the opening degree &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can determine whether the throttle opening degree is zero, which can be a more simple calculation. If the determination is affirmative, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> At the step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is controlled to operate in a trolling mode. For example, a trolling speed operation is when the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is allowed to operate at idle speed with the transmission in a drive position, i.e., forward or reverse. Under this condition, the propeller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> can rotate and accordingly the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can propel the watercraft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in at a slow speed. In a trolling mode, engine speed is, for example, 650-750 rpm, as described above. In an illustrative example, the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sends a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to fix the camshaft angular timing at the fully retarded position. Preferably, the signal is configured to cause the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to bias the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> against the stoppers <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> such that the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> cannot vibrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> If the determination at the step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is negative, the routine moves to a step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At the step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is controlled to operate in a normal mode. For example, the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> allows the output of the control value of the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> to be sent to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> thus sets the camshaft timing at a position between the fully retarded and fully advanced position given by the control value calculation unit <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> If the engine continuously operates in a high speed mode such as, for example, 6,000 rpm or more in the normal running mode, the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> sets the camshaft timing at the fully retarded position and the vanes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can repeatedly hit the stoppers. The program of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> thus can have a further step (not shown) to determine whether the throttle opening degree is fixed to the fully opened position (or almost fully opened position) for a preset period time and/or the target camshaft angular position is set at the fully retarded position for the period of time or another preset period of time. If the determination of this additional step is affirmative, the control value adjustment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the ECU <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can send a control signal to the OCV <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to coercively fix the camshaft angular timing at the fully retarded position. Alternatively, this additional control can be executed if the engine speed exceeds a certain predetermined speed or an engine load exceeds a certain predetermined magnitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As thus described, in the present control system, the camshaft angular timing can be set at more advanced timing (or more retarded timing) rather than an optimum timing that is originally given by the control value calculation unit when the transmission is being shifted. The engine operation thus is brought to an unstable state (mostly, with torque fluctuation) and also the torque is lowered, thereby allowing the operator to more easily operate the transmission with less effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In addition, also in the present control system, the valve timing can be kept at the fully retarded position whenever the transmission is in the neutral position. This prevents a time lag that would otherwise be generated if the engine is raced with the transmission in the neutral position, the shifted into a drive position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> After completion of steps S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the routine can then return to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and repeat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Of course, the foregoing description is that of preferred controls having certain features, aspects and advantages in accordance with the present invention. For instance, the VVT mechanism can be provided at the exhaust camshaft rather than the intake camshaft, or at both of the intake and exhaust camshafts. Accordingly, various changes and modifications also may be made to the above-described controls without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. </paragraph>
