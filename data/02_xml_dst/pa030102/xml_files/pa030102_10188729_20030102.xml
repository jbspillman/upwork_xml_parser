<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a secondary battery used in an electric vehicle or the like. Specifically, the present invention relates to a thin rectangular-parallelepiped shaped secondary battery having an improved cooling efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A secondary battery which can be repeatedly charged and discharged is used as a power source of a motor in various types of electric vehicles, for example, a hybrid electric vehicle or the like. A secondary battery, when used in an electric vehicle, is required to have a large capacity of electricity and a high voltage. Therefore, a plurality of secondary batteries are combined to form a battery pack and the battery pack is mounted in a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing an exemplary secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which forms a battery pack to be mounted in an electric vehicle. The secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> formed into a thin rectangular-parallelepiped shape having an open top and a strip-like cover <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for covering the open top of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The thin rectangular-parallelepiped shaped battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a small thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a height H greater than the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a width W greater than the height H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An inner space of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is divided into, for example, six reaction chambers by five walls extending in the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> direction, equally spaced in the width W direction. Each of the reaction chambers contains a plurality of positive plates and a plurality of negative plates which extend in the width W direction of the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In each reaction chamber, the positive plates and the negative plates are provided, being insulated from each other by separators. All the positive plates in the reaction chamber are connected to a positive pole collector plate extending in the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> direction. All the negative plates in the reaction chamber are connected to a negative pole collector plate extending in the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> direction. The positive pole collector plate and the negative pole collector plate oppose each other within the reactive chamber with all the positive plates and the negative plates interposed therebetween. All the positive plates and the negative plates, and the collector plates are in contact with an electrolyte in the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On a side surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a terminal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the positive pole is provided. This terminal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is serially connected to the positive pole collector plate positioned in the reaction chamber adjacent to the surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>. On another side surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y </italic></highlight>of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a terminal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the negative pole is provided. This terminal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is serially connected to the collector plate of the negative pole positioned in the reaction chamber adjacent to the surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>y</italic></highlight>. The positive pole collector plate and the negative pole collector plate are serially connected to the respective positive pole collector plate and the negative pole collector plate in an adjacent reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A plurality of the secondary batteries <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having the above-described structure are stacked side-by-side in the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> direction and connected in series or in parallel to each other to form a battery pack. The battery pack is mounted in an electric vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a problem that, due to a reaction resistance caused by a battery reaction and component resistance caused by collecting electricity and connection between the components, a temperature in the reaction chamber rises and thus a temperature of the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rises. Especially, when a large amount of current is charged and/or discharged, temperature of the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> rises significantly. If the temperature in the reaction chamber rises, battery reaction in the reaction chamber is weakened. Thus, cooling air is supplied and passed through the space between a pair of stacked secondary batteries in the height H direction (e.g., from the bottom to the top of the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) to cool the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the secondary battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which extend in the height H direction on each surface <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>along the width W direction of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with a certain space therebetween in the width W direction for smoothly passing the cooling air through the spaces between the pair of the stacked secondary batteries. By keeping the ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of one secondary battery in contact with those of an adjacent secondary battery in a structure in which the batteries <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are stacked side-by-side, spaces for passing the cooling air are formed between the surfaces <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the secondary batteries <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is cooled by passing the cooling air through these spaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A number of protrusions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided on the surfaces <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the battery case body <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to improve a resistance of the secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> against pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In recent years, for improving a power output of such a thin rectangular-parallelepiped shaped secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at a low temperature, the capacity of the secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is increased by increasing only the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the battery case <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to increase the number of the plates contained in each reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, such an attempt to increase the capacity causes a problem that the temperature in the each reaction chamber is further raised by the heat of reaction. As described above, in such a secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, each reaction chamber is cooled by passing the cooling air along the surfaces <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the battery case <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. If only the thickness D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the battery case <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the secondary battery <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is increased, an area for radiating heat due to cooling air does not increase. Thus, each chamber cannot be sufficiently cooled. </paragraph>

Therefore, the cooling air which flows through the spaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> efficiently cools down the radiators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus the surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the battery cases <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the secondary batteries <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to which the radiators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are attached can be efficiently cooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has a relatively large thickness D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the battery case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the number of positive plates and the negative plates contained in the reaction chambers of the battery case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is relatively increased with respect to the conventional secondary batteries. Thus, the current for charging and/or discharging the battery increases and temperature rise in the reaction chamber is promoted.

Thus, the surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the battery case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are efficiently cooled. The cooling of the reaction chambers is promoted. As a result, the temperature rise in the reaction chamber is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention ensures suppression of the temperature rise in the reaction chamber even if the thickness D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased and the temperature rise in the reaction chambers is promoted.

Thus, moisture or hydrogen gas in the reaction chambers is prevented from permeating the surfaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the battery case body made of a synthetic resin and leaking out of the reaction chambers. Therefore, the secondary battery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can be used in an increased stable manner for a long time. </paragraph>

However, since the cooling air passes from the bottom to the top of the secondary battery and the radiators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a high heat conductivity radiate heat in a uniform manner, the temperatures in the reaction chambers can be uniformalized throughout the reaction chambers. When the radiators <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are not provided for each of the reaction chambers, and the cooling air is not provided, the battery case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has maximum temperature of 50&deg; C. at the upper portion and 40&deg; C. at the lower portion.
