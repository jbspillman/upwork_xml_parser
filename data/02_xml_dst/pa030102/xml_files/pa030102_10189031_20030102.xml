<heading lvl="1">FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to systems for discretely detecting the proximity of a human to sensor and, in more specific embodiments, for discretely detecting the proximity of a human to a dangerous portion of a piece of power equipment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Safety systems often must be able to detect the presence of a human body or some portion thereof in a dangerous location. For instance, interruption of a beam in a light curtain is used to sense the presence of an operator near a dangerous machine. When the beam is broken, the machine can be shut down automatically to reduce the chance of injury. Light curtains, however, are limited to protecting areas that can be bounded by planar surfaces, and that will not be penetrated by any object, not just humans. However, there are many instances where workpieces must enter an area that cannot be protected by a light curtain because the light curtain cannot distinguish between a human and a workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As a solution to the problem of distinguishing work pieces from humans, numerous radio frequency proximity detection systems have been developed. The radio-frequency systems create a radio-frequency electric field in a protected area that is altered when some part of a human body enters the area. A limitation with such systems is that they are not very discrete in detection. More specifically, it is very difficult to precisely define the protection area with radio-frequency systems. Typically, the system cannot determine the distance to the body accurately and therefore a hand or body at long range may generate the same signal change as a finger in closer proximity. As a result, radio-frequency systems are prone to false trips or may miss actual dangerous conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In view of the limitations of the prior art detection systems, it would be desirable to have a system that could reliably and discretely detect proximity between a user and a dangerous location prior to actual contact.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A machine according to the present invention is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and indicated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be any of a variety of different types and configurations of machine adapted for cutting workpieces, such as wood, plastic, etc. Machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a motor assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adapted to drive the cutting tool. Machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> configured to minimize the potential of a serious injury to a person using machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted to detect the occurrence of one or more dangerous, or triggering, conditions during use of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If such a dangerous condition is detected, safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to limit any injury to the user caused by the dangerous condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a suitable power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide power to operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be an external power source such as line current, or an internal power source such as a battery. Alternatively, power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include a combination of both external and internal power sources. Furthermore, power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include two or more separate power sources, each adapted to power different portions of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may take any one of many different forms, depending on the type of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include a stationary housing configured to support motor assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in driving engagement with cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include a movable structure configured to carry cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between multiple operating positions. As a further alternative, operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include one or more transport mechanisms adapted to convey a workpiece toward and/or away from cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the case of chop saws, operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> typically takes the form of an arbor block pivotally coupled to a base or frame. Cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mounted on the arm and pivotal upward toward a workpiece supported by the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be adapted to receive inputs from a variety of sources including detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and motor assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The control subsystem may also include one or more sensors adapted to monitor selected parameters of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> typically includes one or more instruments operable by a user to control the machine. The control subsystem is configured to control machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in response to the inputs it receives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to detect one or more dangerous, or triggering, conditions during use of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the detection subsystem may be configured to detect that a portion of the user&apos;s body is dangerously close to, or in contact with, a portion of cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As another example, the detection subsystem may be configured to detect the rapid movement of a workpiece due to kickback by the cutting tool, as is described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/182,866, filed Feb. 16, 2000, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,914, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may inform control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the dangerous condition, which then activates reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the detection subsystem may be adapted to activate the reaction subsystem directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Once activated in response to a dangerous condition, reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to engage operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> quickly to prevent serious injury to the user. It will be appreciated that the particular action to be taken by reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will vary depending on the type of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or the dangerous condition that is detected. For example, reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be configured to do one or more of the following: stop the movement of cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, disconnect motor assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, place a barrier between the cutting tool and the user, retract the cutting tool from its operating position, etc. The reaction subsystem may be configured to take a combination of steps to protect the user from serious injury. Placement of a barrier between the cutting tool and teeth is described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,206, filed Aug. 14, 2000, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Retraction of the cutting tool from its operating position is described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,089, filed Aug. 14, 2000, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The configuration of reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> typically will vary depending on which action(s) are taken. In the exemplary embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to stop the movement of cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and includes a brake mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a biasing mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a restraining mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a release mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Brake mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under the urging of biasing mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. During normal operation of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, restraining mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> holds the brake mechanism out of engagement with the operative structure. However, upon receipt of an activation signal by reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the brake mechanism is released from the restraining mechanism by release mechanism <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, whereupon, the brake mechanism quickly engages at least a portion of the operative structure to bring the cutting tool to a stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the exemplary embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and described above may be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the type and configuration of operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Turning attention to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one example of the many possible implementations of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the form of a circular blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mounted on a rotating shaft or arbor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of cutting teeth (not shown) disposed around the outer edge of the blade. As described in more detail below, brake mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage the teeth of blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and stop rotation of the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary implementation, detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is adapted to detect the dangerous condition of the user coming into close proximity to blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The detection subsystem operates by imparting through a connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> a high voltage charge to blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and watching for the electrical discharge that will occur when the user&apos;s hand approaches the blade closely enough that the electric field between the user and the blade will exceed the dielectric breakdown strength of the air separating the blade and the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Typically, the blade, or some larger portion of cutting tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is electrically isolated from the remainder of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to permit creation of the electrical charge on the blade. Alternatively, detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may include a different sensor assembly configured to detect proximity in other ways, such as optically, resistively, etc. In any event, the detection subsystem is adapted to transmit a signal to control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when dangerous proximity between the user and the blade is detected. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of alternative detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,200, filed Aug. 14, 2000, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,211, filed Aug. 14, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/270,011, filed Feb. 20, 2001, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes one or more instruments <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that are operable by a user to control the motion of blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Instruments <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may include start/stop switches, speed controls, direction controls, etc. Control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also includes a logic controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> connected to receive the user&apos;s inputs via instruments <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Logic controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also connected to receive a detection signal from detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, the logic controller may be configured to receive inputs from other sources (not shown) such as blade motion sensors, workpiece sensors, etc. In any event, the logic controller is configured to control operative structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in response to the user&apos;s inputs through instruments <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. However, upon receipt of a detection signal from detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the logic controller overrides the control inputs from the user and activates reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to stop the motion of the blade. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of control subsystem <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,059, filed Aug. 14, 2000 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,094, filed Aug. 14, 2000, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary implementation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, brake mechanism <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> mounted adjacent the edge of blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and selectively moveable to engage and grip the teeth of the blade. Pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be constructed of any suitable material adapted to engage and stop the blade. As one example, the pawl may be constructed of a relatively high strength thermoplastic material such as polycarbonate, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), etc., or a metal such as aluminum, etc. It will be appreciated that the construction of pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will vary depending on the configuration of blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In any event, the pawl is urged into the blade by a biasing mechanism such as a spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In the illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is pivoted into the teeth of blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that sliding or rotary movement of pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may also be used. The spring is adapted to urge pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> into the teeth of the blade with sufficient force to grip the blade and quickly bring it to a stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The pawl is held away from the edge of the blade by a restraining mechanism such as a fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The fusible member is constructed of a suitable material adapted to restrain the pawl against the bias of spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and also adapted to melt under a determined electrical current density. Examples of suitable materials for fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> include NiChrome wire, stainless steel wire, etc. The fusible member is connected between the pawl and a contact mount <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Preferably, fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> holds the pawl relatively close to the edge of the blade to reduce the distance pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> must travel to engage blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Positioning the pawl relatively close to the edge of the blade reduces the time required for the pawl to engage and stop the blade. Typically, the pawl is held approximately {fraction (1/32)}-inch to &frac14;-inch from the edge of the blade by fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; however other pawl-to-blade spacings may also be used within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is released from its unactuated, or cocked, position to engage blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a release mechanism in the form of a firing subsystem <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The firing subsystem is coupled to contact mount <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and is configured to melt fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by passing a surge of electrical current through the fusible member. Firing subsystem <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is coupled to logic controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and activated by a signal from the logic controller. When the logic controller receives a detection signal from detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the logic controller sends an activation signal to firing subsystem <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which melts fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, thereby releasing the pawl to stop the blade. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,056, filed Aug. 14, 2000, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,169, filed Aug. 14, 2000, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,170, filed Aug. 14, 2000, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that activation of the brake mechanism may require the replacement of one or more portions of safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> typically are single-use components which must be replaced before the safety system is ready to be used again. Thus, it may be desirable to incorporate one or more portions of safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a cartridge that can be easily replaced. For example, in the exemplary implementation depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a replaceable cartridge <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a housing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Pawl <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, fusible member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and contact mount <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are all mounted within housing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other portions of safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be mounted within the housing. In any event, after the reaction subsystem has been activated, the safety system can be reset by replacing cartridge <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The portions of safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> not mounted within the cartridge may be replaced separately or reused as appropriate. Various exemplary embodiments and implementations of a safety system using a replaceable cartridge are described in more detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,201, filed Aug. 14, 2000 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/225,212, filed Aug. 14, 2000, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case of miter saws, chop saws, radial arm saws, and other power equipment in which a cutting tool moves toward and into a workpiece to cut the workpiece, reaction subsystem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include a system to stop the cutting tool from continuing to move into the workpiece. Stopping the translational motion of the cutting tool can prevent or minimize any injury from accidental contact between a user and the cutting tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may take many different forms. For example, connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may take the form of a conductive slip ring or conductive brush in direct contact with the blade, or some member electrically coupled to the blade, such as the arbor. It should be noted that the term blade is used for convenience, but the actual element which is used as the sensor may be a blade, some other type of cutter, guard, or some other member placed where proximity by a user&apos;s body would be indicative of a dangerous condition. As another example, connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be a relatively short air gap. As voltage is applied, the charge can jump a short gap to charge the blade. The gap should preferably be substantially smaller than the desired detection distance at which the user&apos;s finger or hand should be detected. Typical gaps would be less than 1 mm. Connection <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may also be capacitive as described in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/225,211, filed Aug. 14, 2000. In addition, blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be electrically isolated in any suitable fashion, such as disclosed in the above-cited case. It should be noted that the isolation of the blade should be sufficient to prevent dielectric breakdown and resultant arcing at any point between the blade or other isolated members and grounded portions of the saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a high voltage generation system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to create a high voltage to be applied to the blade through coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the simplest high voltage generation system and coupling may be an insulated belt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> running between a motor pulley <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an arbor pulley <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. With the proper triboelectric selection of materials, this arrangement can act like a Van De Graff generator to impart a high voltage static charge to blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, it may be desirable to have a charge dissipation element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> connected to the blade to limit the charge build up on the blade. This might be a surge suppression device, such as a transient voltage suppressor Zener diode, to divert charge after a desired voltage has been established on the blade, or a resistor to dissipate charge at a known rate so that the equilibrium voltage on the blade is at the desired level. Alternatively, a safety gap formed by two closely-spaced electrodes, one associated with the blade and the other with ground, may be used to limit the blade voltage. When the blade voltage exceeds the arc-over distance between the electrodes, arcing will occur and the blade voltage will be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, high voltage generation system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> incorporates a high voltage power supply <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to generate a known voltage. Power supply <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is coupled to impart a high voltage signal to blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As described above, coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be configured to couple the high voltage power supply directly to the blade, or indirectly through some other component such as arbor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that is electrically coupled to the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Power supply <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be any of a variety of suitable high voltage power supplies such as are well known in the art. Examples of suitable power supplies include those found in electronic ignitions, flyback transformer supplies such as are used in CRTs, spark gap circuits such as are used in tazers, etc. Alternatively, power supply <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be a regulated high voltage power supply such as a Bertan Model 605C-200P, N 0-20 kV 250 microamp power supply or similar power supply. It will be appreciated that the particular supply chosen will depend on the application voltage, current and other characteristics required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The voltage applied to the blade may be a DC voltage that could be applied either continuously or intermittently. Alternatively, the voltage may be AC and applied continuously or in intermittent alternating sign DC pulses. The intermittent application may be useful where there is a relatively high-resistance grounding path connecting the blade to a grounded member of the machine. For instance, work pieces such as wet or green wood may provide a path to ground that could discharge a DC voltage from the blade at a greater rate than could be safely maintained at high voltage. By applying a pulsed signal of single or alternative sign and looking at the peak pulse voltage or behavior near peak, the effect of discharge through green wood or other parasitic conductive path can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the voltage is pulsed, the frequency of pulsing is preferably at least 100 cycles per second (CPS), and more preferably 500-5000 CPS. As the cycle rate goes down, the required detection distance must increase to insure that the reaction system can protect the user adequately. For instance, at 100 CPS, the user may approach within the detection distance for up to 10 ms before a pulse occurs. This may represent a travel distance of 5 mm or more. Thus if the detection distance is 3 mm, the user could have already reached the blade, prior to detection. Thus, the cycle rate should be chosen to insure safe detection in view of the expected detection distance and approach velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The voltage applied to the blade is selected to create a dielectric breakdown between the user and the blade at a desired distance. The typical dielectric breakdown strength of air is about 30,000 volts per centimeter. Thus, if the desired detection distance is 5 mm, the voltage applied should be approximately 15,000 volts. Typical voltages would range between 300 and 60,000 volts and more preferably between 3,000 and 12,000 volts. These ranges will provide detection distances between approximately 0.1 mm and approximately 20 mm and between approximately 1 and approximately 4 mm, respectively, although the exact breakdown distances are dependent on electrode shape&mdash;finger/hand/body and blade&mdash;and air conditions such as humitity and dust contamination. Fortunately, the sharp points on the teeth of a saw blade tend to concentrate the electric field and therefore decrease the voltage necessary to generate an arc to the user. Depending on the application it may be desirable to alternate the sign of the applied voltage so that if the user&apos;s body has a static charge relative to ground, the voltage will be additive at least on one sign of the high voltage, thereby insuring reliable detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also includes a static discharge detection system or module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The static discharge detection module is coupled to a sensor assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> adapted to detect a static discharge between the blade and a human body. Sensor assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is coupled to sense the voltage on blade <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> either directly, or indirectly through some other component such as arbor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that is electrically coupled to the blade. The coupling may be either conductive or capacitive. In any event, discharge detection module <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is configured to monitor the voltage on the blade and detect any change in voltage due to a static discharge event. In one exemplary embodiment, the discharge detection module is configured to monitor the voltage on the blade and compare the detected voltage to the expected voltage. In other words, the voltage sensed by the discharge detection module is correlated with the voltage imparted by the high voltage generation system. If the sensed voltage departs from an expected voltage greater than a threshold amount, a discharge event is detected. It will be appreciated that the expected voltage will depend on the magnitude, frequency and polarity of the applied voltage, and may be a value that varies with time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition to detecting that a discharge has occurred, it is also possible to gather information from the sign of the discharge pulse. For instance, depending on the triboelectric properties of static-creating objects in proximity to the machine, including the user, it may be that static discharges to the blade will occur due to events other than close proximity of the user. However, in some cases it will be possible to use the sign of the discharge pulse to distinguish these events from human proximity discharges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition to looking at the sign of the discharge, in some cases it will be possible to distinguish human proximity discharges from other events by looking at the discharge rate. In particular, the conductivity of the human body will create a discharge rate within a predetermined range. Human Body Model tests typically represent a human body as having a resistance of 1500 ohms and a capacitance of 100 picofarads for static discharge testing. Other types of parasitic discharges, such as might occur through wet or green wood, will typically exhibit different discharge rates. By monitoring the discharge current directly or through monitoring the rate of change of voltage on the blade, it is possible to distinguish certain types of non-human discharges from discharges indicative of a dangerous proximity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Other properties of the discharge pulse can also be used to more reliably distinguish dangerous conditions from incidental or parasitic discharges. For instance, the rise time of the current of the discharge pulse may vary with the approach speed of the body to the blade. Therefore, by analyzing the rise rate of the discharge current, under some circumstances it will be possible to measure the approach speed and therefore evaluate the danger. In addition, with a relatively high frequency pulsed voltage, several samples may be taken to further characterize the danger. For instance, subsequent samples may show that the hand is no longer approaching the blade or is approaching more rapidly. In such case, the safety system may be configured not to react (or to react differently) if it determines the user&apos;s hand is moving away from the blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has been described above in the general context of a woodworking machine having a circular saw blade, it will be appreciated that the detection subsystem described herein may be adapted for use with a wide variety of different machines having a variety of different configurations. Furthermore, detection subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into a variety of different configurations of safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Examples of such other configurations of machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or safety system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are described in the references incorporated above, as well in the following patent applications which are incorporated herein by reference: PCT Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US00/26812, filed Sep. 29, 2000; U.S. patent application Ser.
