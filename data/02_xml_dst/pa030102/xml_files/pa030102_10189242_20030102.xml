<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel analogs of fusidic acid. In particular, the present invention relates to novel glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid. The present invention also relates to novel glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid that have different solubility properties than unmodified fusidic acid and that act as chemotherapeutic agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The discovery of antibiotics was possibly the most important medical breakthrough of the twentieth century, making many previously lethal microbial infections easily treatable. However, the benefits of antibiotic therapy have gradually given rise to a dangerous development, namely antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Through the constant use, and often overuse, of antibiotics, mankind has begun the process of selecting strains of bacteria which are resistant to many types of antibiotics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Physicians employ many strategies to deal with antibiotic resistance, including: aggressively searching for new antibiotics, prescribing existing antibiotics in a more prudent and less frequent manner, and using combinations of diverse antibiotics to treat infections. In order to successfully employ the latter strategy, it is necessary to utilize a combination of antibiotics that have very different biochemical modes of action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fusidic acid is just such an antibiotic. Having a mode of action different than most antibiotics, fusidic acid is unlikely to have cross-resistance with other antibiotics against microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A relatively new antibiotic, fusidic acid was discovered in 1962 by Godtfresden and coworkers &lsqb;See Godtfresden et al., Lancet 1:928 (1962); and, Verbist, J. Antimicrob. Chemotherapy 25: Supp. B:1 (1990)&rsqb;. It was isolated from the fermentation broth of the fungus <highlight><italic>Fusidium coccineum</italic></highlight>. It is a steroid-like antibiotic belonging to the class of the fusidanes, chemically related to cephalosporin P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and to helvolic acid. Of these fusidanes, however, only fusidic acid has been used clinically with success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Fusidic acid is most effective against Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis</italic></highlight>, Clostridium spp. and corynebacteria are highly susceptible &lsqb;See Verbist supra&rsqb;. In addition, a few Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible, including Neisseria and Bacteroides spp. However, most Gram negative organisms, including Gram-negative bacilli and fungi, all enterobacteria, Psuedomonas spp., and other non-fermenters are resistant to treatment with fusidic acid. Fusidic acid exhibits moderate efficacy against streptococci, mycobacteria, and Nocardia spp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Unquestionably, what gives fusidic acid its inherent usefulness in the treatment of microorganisms resistant to other antibiotics is its unique mode of action. Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interference with the elongation factor G &lsqb;See Tanaka et al., Biochem. &amp; Biophys. Res. Commun. 30:278 (1968)&rsqb;. Such a unique mode of action explains the absence of intrinsic cross-resistance between fusidic acid and any other antibiotics. For example, methicillin-resistant staphylococci are usually susceptible to fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to its usefulness against Gram-positive organisms and bacterial resistance to other antibiotics, there have been recent discoveries related to the use of fusidic acid, which may provide even more clinical benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The use of fusidic acid in treating staphylococcal bone and joint infections has been described &lsqb;See Coombs, J. Antimicrob. Chemotherapy 25: Supp. B:53 (1990)&rsqb;. The usefulness of fusidic acid in the treatment of acute osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, chronic osteomyelitis, and other infections encountered in orthopedic surgery merits continued research into the use of fusidic acid for other orthopedic maladies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Fusidic acid has also recently been shown to be highly effective in treating recurrent bronchopulmonary infections with <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic></highlight>suffered by patients having cystic fibrosis &lsqb;See Jensen et al, J. Antimicrob. Chemotherapy 25: Supp. B:45 (1990)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Perhaps the most exciting recent discovery is the possible use of fusidic acid in the treatment of AIDS. As described by Barnes in a <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>review &lsqb;238:276 (1994)&rsqb;, fusidic acid was found by researchers in Denmark to have in vitro effectiveness against HIV as well as &ldquo;striking clinical improvement&rdquo; in a 58-year-old Danish man stricken with AIDS. These discoveries have led to immediate efforts to determine whether or not fusidic acid will be useful in the treatment of AIDS. So far, the clinical data have been mixed &lsqb;See Youle et al, J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 2:59 (1989); and, Hording et al, Scand. J. Infect. Disease 22:649 (1990)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> With numerous current uses as well as promising future applications, fusidic acid will remain an important pharmaceutical product for the foreseeable future. However, fusidic acid is practically insoluble in water, and the method of choice for oral delivery of the drug is a film coated formulation of sodium fusidate (the sodium salt) or diethanolamine fusidate (the diethanolamine salt). Both derivatives possess significant side-effects including rashes, gastro-intestinal upset, jaundice and other changes in liver function, venospasm, thrombophlebitis, and hemolysis. Clearly, there remains a need for different means of formulation which allows for administration of the agent without inducing serious side-effects. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel analogs of fusidic acid. In particular, the present invention relates to novel glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid. The present invention also relates to novel glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid that have different solubility properties than unmodified fusidic acid and that act as chemotherapeutic agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A fusidic acid &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; or &ldquo;analog&rdquo; of the present invention has the fundamental structure of fusidic acid (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), namely a fused four-ring molecule possessing a steroid-like structure and an alkyl/alkenyl side chain, with either one or more carbohydrate groups attached. The analogs of the present invention have numerous uses. First, they may be successfully employed as standards for analytical techniques (e.g., HPLC) so that new derivatives can be easily identified. Second, the present invention contemplates in vivo use; in accordance with the present invention, a member from the class of novel fusidic acid derivatives is to be delivered as a chemotherapeutic agent, and, in one possible application, to fight anti-microbial infections in the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates derivatives of fusidic acid that have different solubility properties than fusidic acid. These different solubility properties are important because the glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid can be delivered for in vivo use in an admixture with diluent or excipient. It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the mixture. In one embodiment, the diluent or excipient is propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is miscible in water and a number of organic solvents. Propylene glycol is often used as a substitute for ethylene glycol or glycerol. It can be used as a solvent for oral and injectable drugs and is employed in ointments. &lsqb;See Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 9477; and, U.S.P. N.F. 1247&rsqb;. Dextrose dissolved in an aqueous solution is another diluent or excipient contemplated for this purpose. The aqueous solution used with dextrose can be a buffer or other aqueous solution. For the different diluents or excipient, water or aqueous solutions can be used to dilute the diluent or excipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-3 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that it contains a carbohydrate unit (See, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-24 and C-25 positions by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that the double bonds present at those positions in unmodified fusidic acid are both reduced to single bonds. The later modifications can be in combination with other modifications, such as those outlined in the first embodiment. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid modified by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means such that (i) the double bonds at the C-2 and C-3 positions of the saccharide unit bound directly to fusidic acid are both reduced to single bonds, and (ii) the double bonds at the C-24 and C-25 positions of the aglycon are both reduced to single bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-24 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that it has a hydroxyl group. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-24 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means so that the hydroxyl group introduced at the C-24 position has a carbohydrate unit. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-24 and C-3 positions by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means such that both positions contain carbohydrate units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-25 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that it has a hydroxyl group. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-25 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means so that the hydroxyl group introduced at the C-25 position has a carbohydrate unit. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-25 and C-3 positions by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means such that both positions contain carbohydrate units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified at the C-11 position by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that it contains a carbonyl group as opposed to the hydroxyl group present at that position in unmodified fusidic acid. In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that it contains one or more carbohydrate units having terminal hydroxyl groups which have been deprotected as opposed to having terminal hydroxyl groups which are protected. In yet another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a fusidic acid derivative modified by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means, such that the C-2 and C-3 positions of any saccharide units bound directly to a hydroxyl group of the aglycon are both reduced to single bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For all these embodiments, the present invention contemplates having glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid or glycosylated analogs of modified forms of fusidic acid with either an &agr;- or &bgr;-linkage between the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of the aglycon and the C-1 position of the saccharide unit bound to fusidic acid. These two types of analogs are known as the &agr;-anomer and the &bgr;-anomer of the glycosylated analog. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The contemplated derivations may be prepared in a number of different fashions, and the present invention contemplates many different possible combinations of these derivations giving rise to different fusidic acid analogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The carbohydrate unit or units attached to fusidic acid in some of the aforementioned embodiments are exemplified but not limited to 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydroglucose, 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydroglucose diacetate, glucoside, glucoside tetraacetate, mannoside, mannoside tetraacetate, galactoside, galactoside tetraacetate, alloside, alloside tetraacetate, guloside, guloside tetraacetate, idoside, idoside tetraacetate, taloside, taloside tetraacetate, rhamnoside, rhamnoside triacetate, maltoside, maltoside heptaacetate, 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydromaltoside, 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydromaltoside pentaacetate, 2,3-desoxymaltoside, lactoside, lactoside tetraacetate, 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydrolactoside, 2,3-desoxy-2,3-dehydrolactoside pentaacetate, 2,3-desoxylactoside, glucouronate, N-acetylglucosamine. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates the use of carbohydrate unit or units having five-membered rings, known as furanoses.

Combinations of furanoses and pyranoses are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an analog of the present invention is a glycosylated analog of the fusidic acid molecule of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that has different solubility properties than fusidic acid itself. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the derivatizing agents are those reagents which provide the substituents added to fusidic acid or a modified form of fusidic acid. In one embodiment, the derivatizing agent is a carbohydrate glycal.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the carbohydrate glycal is an activated carbohydrate glycal. Activated glycals are those glycals which have a sufficient reactivity to readily react with fusidic acid or a modified fusidic acid to form glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid or of modified fusidic acid. Activated glycals, by definition, are not the parent glycal themselves. Activated glycals are synthesized by a) providing in any order: i) the glycal, ii) an activating reagent, and iii) a catalyst; b) reacting in any order: i) the glycal, ii) a protecting reagent, and iii) a catalyst, under conditions such that an activated carbohydrate glycal is formed.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an analog of the present invention is synthesized by a) providing in any order: i) a modified fusidic acid, ii) a derivatizing reagent, and iii) a catalyst; b) reacting in any order: i) said modified fusidic acid, ii) said derivatizing reagent, and iii) said catalyst, under conditions such that a glycosylated analog of a modified form of the fusidic acid molecule of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is formed having different solubility properties than unmodified fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A modified form of fusidic acid is fusidic acid that has been modified by chemical, enzymatic, or biological means so that the modified fusidic acid may still form a glycosylated analog in the aforementioned reaction. In one embodiment, a modified form of fusidic acid is fusidic acid wherein the C-24 and C-25 positions having double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. In another embodiment, the modified form of fusidic acid is fusidic acid wherein the hydroxyl group at C-11 has been oxidized to a carbonyl group. In another embodiment, the modified form of fusidic acid is fusidic acid wherein a hydroxyl group has been introduced at the C-24 position. For this modified form of fusidic acid, the carbon at C-24 may be either one of the two epimers, R or S. This modified form of fusidic acid may consist either of an approximately equal mixture of the two optical isomers at the C-24 position or an excess of one optical isomer over the other. In another embodiment, the modified form of fusidic acid is fusidic acid wherein a hydroxyl group has been introduced at the C-25 position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For each of these modified forms of fusidic acid, the molecule may have other modifications termed &ldquo;protecting groups&rdquo; which prevent any functional groups of the modified form of fusidic acid from interfering with the glycosylation reaction. It may be the case that depending on whether the modified form of fusidic acid has certain protecting groups, the modified form of fusidic acid may react with the derivatizing reagent to give a glycosylated analog of a modified form of the fusidic acid molecule having more than one carbohydrate unit bound directly through a hydroxyl group to the aglycon. In one embodiment, the protecting group is an acyl. In one embodiment the acyl is monochloroacetyl. In another embodiment, the protecting group is a methyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an analog of the present invention is synthesized by a) providing in any order: i) a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having one or more protecting groups and ii) a deprotection agent; b) reacting in any order: i) said glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having one or more protecting groups and ii) the deprotecting reagent to form a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having fewer protecting groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Protecting groups are those groups which prevent undesirable reactions involving unprotected functional groups. In one embodiment, protecting groups protect the terminal hydroxyl groups of a carbohydrate unit. In one embodiment, the protecting group is an acyl. In one embodiment, the acyl is acetate. In one embodiment, the acyl is monochloroacetyl. In one embodiment, the acyl is methoxyacetyl. The prefix &ldquo;per&rdquo; indicates that all hydroxyl groups in a particular carbohydrate unit are protected by the designated functionality. For example, a &ldquo;per-(CIOAc)-glycal&rdquo; will have monochloroacetyl groups bound to each hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate unit. Deprotection reagents remove protecting groups. For example, in one embodiment, reaction of a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid with carbohydrate unit or units having protecting acyl groups with a deprotection reagent gives a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having no protecting groups, i.e., the carbohydrate unit or units have deprotected, free hydroxyl groups. This reaction is commonly known as a hydrolysis reaction. In one embodiment, the deprotecting reagent is a chemical reagent which has properties of a nucleophile. In one embodiment, the deprotecting reagent is Ba(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, the deprotecting reagent is NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel analogs of fusidic acid. In particular, the present invention relates to novel glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid that have different solubility properties than unmodified fusidic acid itself. The present invention also relates to glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid that act as chemotherapeutic agents. The description of the present invention involves: (I) Properties of Unmodified Fusidic Acid and Properties of Previously Modified Fusidic Acid Derivatives (Prior Art); (II) Physical Properties of Fusidic Acid Analogs of the Present Invention; (III) Synthesis of Novel Glycosylated Fusidic Acid Analogs; (IV) In Vivo Uses; (V) Methodology for Screening Glycosylated Analogs of Fusidic Acid Analogs Based on Solubility Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> I. Fusidic Acid and Previously Described Derivatives </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present inventors are unaware of previous efforts directed at improving the water solubility of fusidic acid by chemical derivatization of the hydroxyl groups with hydrophilic groups. Chemical modifications of fusidic acid have been, as a rule, unsuccessful at generating fusidic analogs which have improved antibacterial or antiviral activity. One of the first and most comprehensive studies of the biological effects of chemical modification of the fusidic acid molecule was undertaken by Godtfresden &lsqb;See Godtfresden et al., J. Med. Chem. 9:15 (1966)&rsqb;. Godtfresden and coworkers synthesized 51 derivatives of fusidic acid; none of these derivatives possessed improved antibacterial activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> II. Physical Properties of Fusidic Acid Analogs of the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The fusidic acid analogs of the present invention will have different solubility properties in propylene glycol as compared to unmodified fusidic acid. The different solubility properties will most likely be due to the novel carbohydrate groups attached to the relatively hydrophobic fusidic acid ring system. The present invention contemplates that those glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid prepared with derivatizing agents that are monosaccharides, i.e., the glucose-derived glycal (glucal), will have a greater solubility in solvents such as propylene glycol as compared to unmodified, fusidic acid. The present invention contemplates that those glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid prepared with derivatizing agents that have multiple saccharide units such as disaccharides, i.e., the lactose-derived glycal (lactal) or maltose-derived glycal (maltal), will have a diminished solubility in solvents such as propylene glycol as compared to unmodified fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the present invention contemplates that those glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid prepared with derivatizing agents that have multiple saccharide units such as disaccharides, i.e., the lactose-derived glycal (lactal) or maltose-derived glycal (maltal), will have an increased solubility in solvents such as aqueous solutions of dextrose as compared to unmodified fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> III. Synthesis Of Novel Glycosylated Fusidic Acid Analogs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Recent developments in the area of pharmaceutical science have centered around efforts to increase the bioavailability of known drugs by chemical derivatization &lsqb;See Brown and Thomas, Aust. J. Pharm. Sci. 8:1 (1979); Ji et al., J. Med. Chem. 33:2264 (1990); Stella et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:145 (1992); and, Kleeman et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:559 (1992)&rsqb;. One approach is to develop methods of glycosylating a variety of medicinally-important compounds with the objective of increasing aqueous solubility while hopefully enhancing the pharmacological profile of these agents. Such a process could unlock the benefits of a broad array of biologically-active compounds with intrinsically modest hydrophilicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The chemistry of glycals is perfectly suited for addressing the above issues. Glycals, cyclic sugar derivatives containing a 1,2-double bond, are indispensable synthetic precursors in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. Though this class of sugars was discovered by Fischer 80 years ago &lsqb;See Fischer and Zach, Preuss. Akad. Wiss. 16:3311 (1913)&rsqb;, there has recently been an immense volume of research using these compounds to synthesize complex polysaccharides and glycosylated products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> One reaction in particular, discovered by Ferrier in 1969 &lsqb;See Ferrier, J. Chem. Soc. C 570 (1969)&rsqb; and in which glycals can be attached to various nucleophiles, allows synthetic chemists to attach carbohydrates to a variety of non-carbohydrate organic molecules. The resulting compound is an O-glycoside in which a carbohydrate unit is attached to an oxygen atom of a typically hydrophobic aglycon (aglycon referring to a non-carbohydrate portion of a molecule). Although similar glycosylation reactions had been accomplished thermally using water, alcohols and phenols &lsqb;See Helferich, Adv. Carbohydrate Chem. 7:209 (1952); Ferrier, J. Chem Soc. 5443 (1964); and, Ferrier et al, J. Chem Soc. 3667 (1962)&rsqb;, the Ferrier reaction&apos;s use of boron trifluoride etherate greatly expanded the synthetic scope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Despite its utility, the Ferrier reaction has been less successfully applied to the commercial glycosylation of medicinally useful compounds. Such reactions, preferably performed on a large scale, require the use of Lewis acid catalysts which are more efficient, less toxic, and less harsh toward the aglycon. For example, since most of these strong Lewis acids spontaneously react with air and moisture, the use of these Lewis acids presents serious problems when handling them, particularly in the large-scale, industrial setting. For these reasons, the use of the non-toxic, stable catalyst iodine, which is an extremely mild Lewis acid and yet according to the invention retains enough acidity to effect glycosylation, is the preferred reagent. &lsqb;See U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,296, hereby incorporated by reference; pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/251,869, hereby incorporated by reference; and, pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/429,941, hereby incorporated by reference.&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one preferred aspect, the invention concerns O-glycoside compounds obtained by reacting an oxygen nucleophile compound and a glycosylating agent selected from 3-acylated five- and six-membered glycals in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine (5-50 mol % with 20 mol % being the most representative) to provide a reaction mixture containing the glycosylated product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates the preparation of the necessary glycals by the following procedure. First, the desired carbohydrate may be obtained commercially in non-acetylated form and acetylated by reaction with acetic anhydride in acetic acid with a catalytic amount of hydrobromic acid. The acetylated carbohydrate is thereafter converted to an acetylated carbohydrate halide (e.g., bromide, by reaction with hydrobromic acid in acetic acid). The acetylated carbohydrate halide is converted to the acetylated glycal by reaction with Zn/CuSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The acetylated glycal can be converted into the more reactive o-anisoyl derivatives by reaction with o-anisic acid (2-methoxybenzoic acid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Glycals having substituted acetyl protecting groups can be prepared by first hydrolyzing the unsubstituted acetates of the glycals. Sodium methoxide or ammonia in methanol can be used for this purpose. Subsequent reaction of the unprotected glycals with the appropriate reagents will give the desired protected glycals having substituted acetyl groups. In the case of per monochloroacetyl glycals, reaction of the unprotected glycal with monochloroacetyl chloride and pyridine gives the glycal protected by monochloroacetyl groups. In the case of permethoxyacetyl glycals, reaction of the deprotected glycal with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, and methoxyacetic acid gives the glycal protected by methoxyacetyl groups. Other glycals having substituted acetyl protecting groups can be prepared in a similar fashion. These glycals, which are considered derivatizing agents, are then reacted with fusidic acid or a modified form of fusidic acid. Alternatively, a commercially available acetylated carbohydrate may be used and thereby obviate the need for the initial reaction step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> For glycosylation, preferred glycals of the formulas A-F are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, where R<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is a lower alkyl group. R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are the same or different and represent an aliphatic acyl group, an aromatic acyl group such as a benzoyl group, or, in the case of either R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, a carbohydrate unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Any of various suitable solvents can be used for the glycosylation reaction of which THF, acetone, diethyl ether, methylene chloride, chloroform, and benzene are preferred. The reaction temperature and time can be varied, e.g., ranging from &minus;78&deg; C. to room temperature for about 0.5 to 12 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In another preferred aspect, the present invention contemplates partly and completely deprotected glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid and glycosylated analogs of a modified fusidic acid. These deprotected products are produced by hydrolysis of one or more acyl groups from the acylated glycosylated analogs by a deprotection agent. Deprotecting glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid or glycosylated analogs of modified fusidic acid must be done with care so as not to hydrolyze the acetate at C-16, a functionality that occurs naturally in fusidic acid and is essential for biological activity of fusidic acid. &lsqb;See Godtfresden et al., J. Med. Chem. 9:15 (1966)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, when the carbohydrate unit or units have unsubstituted acetyl groups, then Ba(OH)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in methanol will hydrolyze the acetyl groups of the carbohydrate unit or units to give the free alcohol and carboxylic acid. When the carbohydrate unit or units have monochloro-substituted acetyl groups, then NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or KHCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in methanol and water will hydrolyze the acyl groups to give the unprotected, free alcohol. Under either of these conditions, the acetyl group at C-16 of the aglycon present in unmodified and underivatized fusidic acid will not be hydrolyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates introducing a new hydroxyl functionality into unmodified fusidic acid. Before oxidizing the C-24, C-25 double bond of fusidic acid, the hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-11 and the C-21 carboxylic acid group must be protected with appropriate protecting groups. In one embodiment, acylation of the hydroxyl groups of fusidic acid gives monochloroacetates at C-3 and C-11. In one embodiment, methylation of the C-21 carboxylic acid of fusidic acid with diazomethane gives its methyl ester derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the hydroxyl group can be added at C-24 through hydroboration chemistry. The resulting product will have a chiral center at C-24. If an achiral hydroboration reagent is employed, then the resulting chiral center at C-24 will consist of an epimeric mixture. Alternatively, the judicious choice of chiral hydroboration reagents followed by oxidative cleavage of the resulting carbon-boron bond can provide either the R or S epimer. In one embodiment, reaction of the hydroxyl group of the modified aglycon with a glycal will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having a carbohydrate unit at position C-24. In one embodiment, subsequent hydrolysis of the protecting groups introduced to the aglycon and the protecting groups of the carbohydrate unit will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having no protecting groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the hydroxyl group can be added at C-25 through the use of oxymercuration chemistry. In one embodiment, reaction of the hydroxyl group of the modified aglycon with a glycal will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having a carbohydrate unit at position C-25. In one embodiment, subsequent hydrolysis of the protecting groups introduced to the aglycon and the protecting groups of the carbohydrate unit will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having no protecting groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the protecting groups at C-3 and C-11 can be hydrolyzed after introduction of the hydroxyl functionality at either C-24 or C-25 by treatment with a base. In one embodiment, the base is NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, the base is KHCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, reaction of the modified fusidic acid having unprotected hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-24 with glycal will give a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having a carbohydrate unit at each of positions C-3 and C-24. In one embodiment, subsequent hydrolysis of the protecting group at C-21 of the aglycon and the protecting groups of the carbohydrate units will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having no protecting groups. In another embodiment, reaction of the modified fusidic acid having unprotected hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-25 with glycal will give a glycosylated analog of fusidic acid having a carbohydrate unit at each of positions C-3 and C-25. In one embodiment, subsequent hydrolysis of the protecting group at C-21 of the aglycon and the protecting groups of the carbohydrate units will give a glycosylated analog of modified fusidic acid having no protecting groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> IV. In vivo uses </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates using therapeutic compositions of soluble fusidic acid analogs. It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the particular nature of the therapeutic preparation. For example, such compositions can be provided together with physiologically tolerable liquid, gel or solid carriers, diluents, adjuvants and excipient. In addition, fusidic acid analogs may be used together with other chemotherapeutic agents, including unmodified fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> With respect to the mode of administration, the fusidic acid analogs may be employed for intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or topical (including topical ophthalmic) administration. Formulations for such administrations may comprise an effective amount of fusidic acid analog in sterile water or physiological saline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, formulations may contain such normally employed additives as binders, fillers, carriers, preservatives, stabilizing agents, emulsifiers, buffers and excipient as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. These compositions typically contain 1%-95% of active ingredient, preferably 2%-70%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The compositions can be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection may also be prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The fusidic acid analogs of the present invention are often mixed with diluents or excipient which are compatible and physiologically tolerable. Suitable diluents and excipient are, for example, water, saline, ethylene glycol, dextrose, glycerol, or the like, and combinations thereof. One preferred choice is propylene glycol. A second preferred choice is aqueous solutions of dextrose. In addition, if desired the compositions may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, stabilizing or pH buffering agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Options for optimal method of fusidic acid analog administration include, but are not limited to: a 30-minute infusion every three weeks, a 30-minute infusion daily&times;5 every three weeks, a 24-hour infusion every three weeks, a 120-hour infusion every three weeks, and a 72-hour infusion repeated every three weeks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Likewise, dosage ranges for fusidic acid analog treatment include, but are not limited to: 1 to 50 mg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> V. Methodology for Screening Glycosylated Analogs of Fusidic Acid Analogs Based on Solubility Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> We claim glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid. These compounds may be prepared by either glycosylation of fusidic acid itself or a modified form of fusidic acid, and once glycosylated, the glycosylated analogs may undergo a number of subsequent modifications. This section outlines a procedure whereby a novel glycosylated analog of fusidic acid can be screened for desired solubility properties. These desired solubility properties consist of an increased solubility of the glycosylated analog as compared to unmodified fusidic acid in different diluents or excipient. The present invention contemplates the use of propylene glycol as a diluent or excipient. The present invention contemplates the use of aqueous solutions of dextrose as a diluent or excipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> This screening procedure is proposed without intending to be limited to the mechanism by which enhanced solubility is achieved in different diluents or excipient. The present screening method also contemplates the use of aqueous solutions with the diluents or excipient. These aqueous solutions can be buffers, saline solution, or other aqueous solutions having auxiliary substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Screening Procedure: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Mode I: Determine whether the aglycon unit of the glycosylated analog of fusidic acid of interest possesses at least one hydroxyl functional group which can be glycosylated with the glycal of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Mode II: Determine whether the glycosylated analog of fusidic acid has enhanced solubility properties in propylene glycol as compared to fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Mode III: Determine whether the glycosylated analog of fusidic acid has enhanced solubility properties in aqueous solutions of dextrose as compared to fusidic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A new glycosylated analog of fusidic acid can be evaluated for the desired solubility properties in propylene glycol according to the procedure outlined in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The solubility properties of the glycosylated analogs of fusidic acid of the present invention will be measured in the diluent or excipient of choice by a spectrophotometric assay. An appropriate amount of the glycosylated analog of fusidic acid will be suspended in 1 mL of the diluent or excipient of choice in a 1.5 mL cryovial.

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> This example describes the synthesis of tri-O-(chloroacetyl)-glucal. Bouhroum and Vottero have reported the prepation of this compound. &lsqb;See Bouhroum and Vottero, Tetra. Letts. 31:7441 (1990)&rsqb;. To a solution of tri-O-acetyl-glucal (18.0 g) in 150 mL of methanol was added 10 mL of 25% sodium methoxide in methanol. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature, whereupon the solvent was removed and the resultant oil was dissolved by first adding 100 mL of methanol and then 400 mL of THF. The solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give 8.78 g (91%) of a yellowish semi-solid. A portion of this product (3.26 g) was dissolved in 150 mL of THF and 15 g of pyridine, cooled to 0&deg; C., and 8.32 g of chloroacetyl chloride added. The solution was then allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was then poured into 100 mL of ether and washed with 100 mL of water, 100 mL of saturated NaHCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, 100 mL of saturated aqueous CuSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 50 mL of brine, dried over Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.

Thus, a number of glycosylated fusidic acid derivatives such as that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> will be prepared where the carbohydrate attached at the C-25 hydroxyl will be, for example, the permonochloroacetylated glucal, maltal, or lactal. The protecting groups of the glycosylated derivative can be hydrolyzed by following the procedure outlined in Experimentals 24 and 14 to hydrolyze the monochloroacetyls and methyl ester, respectively. These reactions will give the molecule shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the modified fusidic acid of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> can first be deprotected by following the protocol in Experimental 24 to give the modified fusidic acid in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> which has no protected hydroxyl groups yet still has a protected carboxylic acid at C-21. Reaction of this compound with 2.1 equivalents of a permonochloroacetylated glycal according to the protocol in Experimentals 23 and 25 will give the twice glycosylated analog of fusidic acid as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. The protecting groups can then be removed as discussed above by following Experimentals 24 and 14 to give the molecule depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
