<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to confocal scanning microscopy and optical coherence microscopy. More specifically, it relates to fiber-based optical coherence microscopy systems incorporating a novel, fiber-coupled, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The advent of fiber optics and laser technology has brought a renewed life to many areas of conventional optics. Confocal microscopes, for example, have enjoyed higher resolution, more integrated structure, and enhanced imaging capability. Consequently, confocal microscopes have become increasingly powerful tools in a variety of applications, including biological and medical imaging, optical data storage and semiconductor applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The original idea of confocal microscopy traces back to the work of Marvin Minsky. Described in his seminal U.S. Pat. No. 3,013,467 is a system in which an illumination beam passes through a pinhole, traverses a beamsplitter, and is focused by an objective to a focal volume within an object. An observation beam that emanates from the focal volume is in turn converged by the same objective lens, reflected by its second encounter with the beamsplitter, and passes through a second pinhole to a photo detector. The geometry of this confocal arrangement is such that only the light beam originating from the focal volume is able to pass through the second pinhole and reach the photo detector, thus effectively discriminating all other out-of-focus signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Contemporary confocal microscopes tend to adopt one of two basic confocal geometries. In the transmission arrangement using two objectives, one objective focuses an illumination beam from a point source onto a focal volume within an object and another objective collects an observation beam that emanates from a confocal overlapping volume (within the focal volume). Whereas in the so-called &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; reflection arrangement, a single objective plays a dual role of focusing light on the object and collecting the light emanated from the object. In either case, the confocal arrangement enables the confocal microscope to attain a higher resolution and sharper definition than a conventional microscope, because out-of-focus signals are rejected. This unique ability has made confocal microscopes particularly useful tools in the examination of biological specimens, since they can view a specific layer within a sample and avoid seeing other layers, the so-called &ldquo;optical sectioning&rdquo;. Confocal microscopy techniques are also exploited to provide a spatial filter in many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The transmission confocal microscope typically employs two separate lenses: one serves as the illumination objective and the other as the observation objective. The single objective in the &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; arrangement can also be a single lens, in either simple or compound form. In order to image a thin layer about a few micrometers thick within a sample, however, the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lenses must be large, so as to provide adequate resolution particularly in the axial direction. This generally results in a short working distance, which is undesirable in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A great deal of ingenuity has accordingly been devoted to improving the axial resolution of confocal microscopes without using high NA lenses. A particularly interesting approach is to spatially arrange two separate illumination and observation objective lenses, or the illumination and observation beam paths, in such a way that the illumination beam and the observation beam intersect at an angle theta (&thgr;) at the focal points, so that the overall point-spread function for the microscope, i.e., the overlapping volume of the illumination and observation point-spread functions results in a substantial reduction in the axial direction. A confocal microscope with such an angled, dual-axis design is termed a confocal theta microscope, or an angled-dual-axis confocal microscope, hereinafter. The underlying principle as well as the advantages of confocal theta microscopy are described in the above referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/628,118, titled &ldquo;Fiber-coupled, High-speed, Integrated, Angled-Dual-Axis Confocal Scanning Microscopes Employing Vertical Cross-Section Scanning&rdquo; of Michael J. Mandella, Mark H. Garrett, and Gordon S. Kino, now allowed, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, and which is hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;application &apos;118&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> More specifically, application &apos;118 discloses an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head mechanically coupled to a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that the illumination and observation beams intersect optimally at an angle &thgr; within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams jointly using a single scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit further causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object, whereby a succession of arc-line scans that progressively deepen into the object is produced, providing a two-dimensional vertical cross-section scan of the object. The vertical scanning unit also comprises a compensation means, for keeping the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams unchanged so to ensure the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation beams in the course of vertical scanning. This novel scanning mechanism, along with the integrated structure of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and the coupling of optical fibers, enables this angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope to perform fast and high resolution scanning over a large transverse field of view, while maintaining a workable working distance. The integration of optical fibers and silicon fabrication technology further renders this angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope integrity, flexibility, scalability, and maneuverability, as desired in many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, one of the applications the aforementioned angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope is particularly suited for is optical coherence microscopy (OCM), which effectively filters out multiple-scattered photon noise, thus providing high sensitivity and large dynamic range of detection when imaging in a scattering medium. Although great stride has been made in improving the sensitivity and imaging capabilities of optical coherence microscopy, as exemplified by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/042,205, now issued, U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,608, commonly assigned to the same assignee, Optical Biopsy Technologies, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., USA, as the present application, optical coherence microscopy has yet to reach its full potential of high resolution and fast scanning, as required in biological and medical applications, particularly in vivo imaging of live tissue which is constantly in motion. Two of the prior art methods of obtaining high axial resolution in an OCM apparatus involve the use of either a large NA objective lens, or the use of a femto-second pulsed laser with a very short coherence length. These methods are described by Wang et al. in &ldquo;High Speed, full field optical coherence microscopy&rdquo;, Proceedings of The SPIE Conference on Coherence Domain Optical Methods in Biomedical Science and Clinical Applications III, San Jose, Calif., January 1999, pp. 204-212, and by Drexler et al. in &ldquo;In vivo ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography&rdquo;, Optics Letters, 21(17), pp. 1221-1223, 1999, all incorporated herein by reference. The primary disadvantage of using a high NA is the limited field of view in which diffraction-limited performance is obtained during high speed transverse scanning. High cost and intricacy of femto-second lasers make the second approach undesirable for a practical instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Hence, there is a need in the art for a new way of applying the techniques of optical coherence microscopy that overcomes the limitations of the prior art methods. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This invention provides an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope. A first embodiment of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning means. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head further comprises a first end of a first single-mode optical fiber serving as a point light source, an angled-dual-axis focusing means, an arc-line scanning means, and a first end of a second single-mode optical fiber serving as a point light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> From the first end of the first optical fiber an illumination beam emerges. The angled-dual-axis focusing means serves to focus the illumination beam to a diffraction-limited illumination focal volume along an illumination axis within an object. The angled-dual-axis focusing means further receives an observation beam emanated from an observation focal volume along an observation axis within the object, and focuses the observation beam to the first end of the second optical fiber. The angled-dual-axis focusing means is designed such that the illumination axis and the observation axis intersect at an angle &thgr; within the object, thereby the illumination and observation focal volumes intersect optimally at a confocal overlapping volume. The arc-line scanning means, preferably in the form of a single scanning element such as a silicon micro-machined scanning mirror, is positioned such that it receives the illumination beam from the angled-dual-axis focusing means and directs the illumination beam to the object. The arc-line scanning means also collects the observation beam emanated from the object and passes the observation beam to the angled-dual-axis focusing means. The arc-line scanning means is further capable of pivoting the illumination and observation beams in such a way that the illumination and observation axes remain intersecting at a fixed angle &thgr; and that the confocal overlapping volume moves along an arc-line perpendicular to both the illumination and observation axes within the object, thereby producing an arc-line scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The vertical scanning means, in the form of a vertical scanning unit, comprises a vertical translation means and a compensation means. The vertical translation means is mechanically coupled to the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head, such that it causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object, whereby a succession of arc-line scans that progressively deepen into the object is produced, providing a two-dimensional vertical cross-section scan of the object. The compensation means keeps the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams substantially unchanged, so as to ensure the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation focal volumes in the course of vertical scanning. Such a compensation mechanism is also crucial for performing optical coherence microscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Altogether, the first embodiment of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention is designed such that it is capable of performing vertical cross-section scanning in a line-by-line fashion with enhanced axial (i.e., vertical) resolution and greater speed, while maintaining a workable working distance and a large field of view. In applications where a three-dimensional volume image of the object is desired, the object may be further moved incrementally along a transverse direction as each vertical cross-section scan is completed. A plurality of vertical cross-section images thus generated can be assembled into a three-dimensional volume image of a region within the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention, an angled-dual-axis confocal head is mechanically coupled to a vertical scanning means and a transverse scanning means. The angled-dual-axis confocal head comprises a first end of a first single-mode optical fiber serving as a point light source, an angled-dual-axis focusing means, and a first end of a second single-mode optical fiber serving as a point light detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> From the first end of the first optical fiber an illumination beam emerges. The angled-dual-axis focusing means serves to focus the illumination beam to a diffraction-limited illumination focal volume along an illumination axis within an object. The angled-dual-axis focusing means further receives an observation beam emanated from an observation focal volume along an observation axis within the object, and focuses the observation beam to the first end of the second optical fiber. The angled-dual-axis focusing means is designed such that the illumination axis and the observation axis intersect at an angle &thgr; with the object, thereby the illumination and observation focal volumes intersect optimally at a confocal overlapping volume. The vertical scanning means, in the form of a vertical scanning unit, comprises a vertical translation means and a compensation means. The vertical translation means is mechanically coupled to the angled-dual-axis confocal head, such that it causes the angled-dual-axis confocal head to move towards or away from the object, whereby producing a vertical scan that deepens into the interior of the object. The compensation means keeps the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams substantially unchanged, thereby ensuring the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation focal volumes in the course of vertical scanning. Moreover, the transverse scanning means, in the form of a transverse stage, serves to translate the object relative to the angled-dual-axis confocal head along transverse directions perpendicular to the vertical direction, thereby providing a transverse scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As such, the second embodiment of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention is capable of performing vertical scans and transverse scans in various ways. By assembling an assortment of the vertical and/or transverse scans in a suitable manner, two-dimensional transverse and/or vertical cross-section images of the object can be obtained. A three-dimensional volume image of the object can also be accordingly constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the term &ldquo;emanating&rdquo; as used in this specification is to be construed in a broad sense as covering any light transmitted back from the object, including reflected light and scattered light. It should be also understood that when describing the intersection of the illumination and observation beams in this specification, the term &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; means that the illumination and observation focal volumes (i.e., the main lobes of the illumination beam&apos;s point-spread function and the observation beam&apos;s point-spread function) intersect in such a way that their respective centers substantially coincide and the resulting overlapping volume has comparable transverse and axial extents. This optimal overlapping volume is termed &ldquo;confocal overlapping volume&rdquo; in this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention, the angled-dual-axis focusing means generally comprises an assembly of beam focusing, collimating, and deflecting elements. Such elements can be selected from the group of refractive lenses, diffractive lenses, GRIN lenses, focusing gratings, micro-lenses, holographic optical elements, binary lenses, curved mirrors, flat mirrors, prisms and the like. A crucial feature of the angled-dual-axis focusing means is that it provides an illumination axis and an observation axis that intersect at an angle &thgr;. The optical fibers can be single-mode fibers, multi-mode fibers, birefrigent fibers, polarization maintaining fibers and the like. Single-mode fibers are preferable in the present invention, for the ends of single-mode fibers provide a nearly point-like light source and detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned arc-line scanning means typically comprises an element selected from the group consisting of scanning mirrors, reflectors, acousto-optic deflectors, electro-optic deflectors, mechanical scanning mechanisms, and Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) scanning micro-mirrors. A preferred choice for the arc-line scanning means is a flat pivoting mirror, particularly a silicon micro-machined scanning mirror for its compact and light-weight construction. Moreover, the arc-line scanning means is placed between the angled-dual-axis focusing means and the object to be examined. This enables the best on-axis illumination and observation point-spread functions to be utilized throughout the entire angular range of an arc-line scan, thereby providing greater resolution over a larger transverse field of view, while maintaining diffraction-limited performance. Such an arrangement is made possible by taking advantage of the longer working distance rendered by using relatively lower NA focusing elements or lenses in the angled-dual-axis focusing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A distinct advantage of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention is that the scanning is achieved by pivoting both the illumination and observation beams, as opposed to moving either the object or the microscope&apos;s objective lenses in the prior art confocal theta scanning microscopes, which can be quite cumbersome to implement and adversely limits the precision of scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another important advantage of the angled-dual-axis arrangement of the present invention is that since the observation beam is positioned at an angle relative to the illumination beam, scattered light along the illumination beam does not easily get passed into the observation beam, except where the beams overlap. This substantially reduces scattered photon noise in the observation beam, thus enhancing the sensitivity and dynamic range of detection. This is in contrast to the direct coupling of scattered photon noise between the illumination and observation beams in a transmission or reciprocal confocal microscope, due to the collinear arrangement between the beams. Moreover, by using low NA focusing elements (or lenses) in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning system of the present invention, the illumination and observation beams do not become overlapping until very close to the focus. Such an arrangement prevents additional scattered light in the illumination beam from directly &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; to the observation beam, hence further filtering out multiple-scattered photon noise in the observation beam. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not eliminate multiple-scattered photon noise that originates within the observation beam. The present invention employs a temporal gating technique, to filter out this source of noise. Altogether, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning system of the present invention has much lower noise and is capable of providing much higher contrast when imaging in a highly scattering medium than the prior art confocal systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that the entire angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head in the first embodiment, or the angled-dual-axis confocal head in the second embodiment, can be mounted on a silicon substrate etched with precision V-grooves which host various optical elements. Such an integrated device offers a high degree of integrity, maneuverability, scalability, and versatility, while maintaining a workable working distance and a large field of view. In particular, a micro-optic version of an integrated, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head (or angled-dual-axis confocal head) of the present invention can be very useful in biological and medical imaging applications, e.g., endoscopes and hand-held optical biopsy instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> All in all, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention provides high resolution scanning with greater precision and faster speed, while maintaining a workable working distance and a large field of view. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention further advantageously exploits the flexibility, scalability and integrity afforded by optical fibers and silicon micro-machining techniques, rendering it a highly versatile and modular device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope incorporating the aforementioned angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope. An exemplary embodiment of the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope as described above (e.g., in its first or second exemplary embodiment), a light source, a beam-splitting means, a reference optical fiber, and a beam-combining means. The beam-splitting means is in optical communication with the light source and the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, such that it diverts a portion of an output beam emitted from the light source to the first optical fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope and a remainder of the output beam to the reference optical fiber, thereby creating an illumination beam and a reference beam from the same parent beam. An observation beam collected by the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope is delivered by way of the second optical fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, and is further combined with the reference beam at the beam-combining means to generate coherent interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the beam-combining means can be in the form of a fiber-optic coupler, at which the reference and second optical fibers are joined and the reference and observation beams are combined. Balanced detection scheme can be accordingly utilized. The system may further comprise a frequency shifting means optically coupled to the first or second optical fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, such that the frequency of the observation beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the frequency shifting means can be optically coupled to the reference optical fiber, such that the frequency of the reference beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the observation beam. In either case, coherent interference between the reference and observation beams is modulated at a heterodyne beat frequency given by the relative frequency shift between the reference and observation beams, allowing for more sensitive heterodyne detection. Moreover, an adjustable optical delay device may be coupled to the reference optical fiber, the first or second optical fiber, so as to maintain coherent interference between the reference and observation beams at the fiber-optic coupler where they are combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In applications where light source has a short coherence length, the optical delay device can be adjusted such that mostly single-scattered light in the observation beam is coherent with the reference beam at the fiber-optic coupler and multiple-scattered light in the observation beam, which traverses over a longer optical path length, does not contribute to the coherent interference, therefore providing further filtering of multiple-scattered light upon detection. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of detection, an optical amplifier can be coupled to the second optical fiber, so as to boost up the power of the observation beam returning from the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An amplified observation beam has an additional advantage of rendering faster scanning rates and consequently higher pixel rates without appreciable loss in the signal-to-noise ratio, because a shorter integration time per pixel of an image is required in data collection. The implementation of balanced detection in this case allows subtraction of the amplifier noise, since preponderance of the spontaneous emission of the optical amplifier would not occur at the heterodyne beat frequency described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The light source in the above embodiment can be an optical fiber amplifier, semiconductor optical amplifier, a fiber laser, a semiconductor laser, a diode-pumped solid state laser, or a broadband OCT light source. The light source may be polarized, or unpolarized. The beam-splitting means can be a fiber-optic coupler, such as an evanescent wave coupler or a fused fiber coupler. Various optical fibers, such as the first, second, and reference optical fibers, are preferably single-mode fibers, for single-mode fibers have the advantage of simplicity and automatic assurance of the mutual spatial coherence of the observation and reference beams upon mixing and detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one case where polarized light is provided by the light source and the beam-splitting means is a polarizing beamsplitter, the orientation of the beamsplitter relative to the polarization of light emitted from the light source can be used to control the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams. Furthermore, the first, second, and reference optical fibers are preferably polarization maintaining (PM) fibers, to control the polarizations of the illumination, observation and reference beams throughout the entire system. The optical coupling between the polarized light source and the polarizing beamsplitter is also preferably by way of a third PM fiber. In this case, the reference and observation beams can be brought into the same polarization by rotating either the reference or second optical fiber before joining them at the fiber-optic coupler. Alternatively, a polarization rotation means, such as a Faraday rotator, can be coupled to either the reference optical fiber or the second optical fiber, such that the reference and observation beams have substantially the same polarization when combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned embodiment can also be used to provide specific information pertaining to the polarization state of light emanated from a polarization-altering, such as a birefrigent-scattering, medium. Many biological tissues, such as tendons, muscle, nerve, bone, cartilage and teeth, exhibit birefrigence due to their linear or fibrous structure. Birefrigence causes the polarization state of light to be altered (e.g., rotated) in a prescribed manner upon refection. Thus, by detecting induced changes in the polarization state of light reflected from a birefrigent-scattering medium, image representing birefrigent (or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; can be obtained. In such a case, the polarizing beamsplitter produces an illumination beam with P-polarization and a reference beam with orthogonal S-polarization from a polarized beam emitted from the light source. An observation beam reflected from a birefirgent-scattering (or polarization-altering) sample carries both P-polarization and S-polarization, where the presence of S-polarization is resulted from the birefrigent (or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in the sample. When the reference and observation beams are combined at the fiber-optic coupler, only the observation beam with S-polarization interferes coherently with the reference beam that has only S-polarization. Consequently, the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal corresponds only to the amplitude of reflectance of light with S-polarization, hence providing an image representing birefrigent (or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In applications where the observation beam with P-polarization is of greater interest, a polarization rotation means, such as a rotatable fiber connector or a Faraday rotator, can be coupled to the reference PM fiber in the above embodiment, such that the polarization of the reference beam is rotated by 90-degree, resulting a reference beam with P-polarization. Upon combining the reference and observation beams in this case, only the observation beam with P-polarization interferes coherently with the reference beam that now has only P-polarization. Consequently, the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal measures only the amplitude of reflectance of light with P-polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in applications where both P-polarization and S-polarization of the observation beam are of interest, a first auxiliary polarizing beamsplitter can be optically coupled to the second PM fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, serving to separate P-polarization and S-polarization of the observation beam by routing them to fourth and fifth PM fibers, respectively. A polarization rotation means, such as a rotatable fiber connector or a Faraday rotator, can be optically coupled to the reference PM fiber and serves to rotate the polarization of the reference beam by 45-degree, thus rendering the reference beam with both P-polarization and S-polarization. The polarization-rotated reference beam is then delivered to a second auxiliary polarizing beamsplitter, which in turn separates P-polarization and S-polarization of the reference beam by routing them to sixth and seventh PM fibers, respectively. The system may further comprise a frequency shifting means optically coupled to the first or second PM fiber, such that the frequency of the observation beam is shifted relative to the reference beam. The fourth and sixth PM fibers can be further joined by a first auxiliary fiber-optic coupler, where the observation and reference beams with S-polarization are coherently combined and the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal corresponds to the amplitude of reflectance of light with S-polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the fifth and seventh PM fibers can be joined by a second auxiliary fiber-optic coupler, at which the observation and reference beams with P-polarization are coherently combined and the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal measures the amplitude of reflectance of light with P-polarization. As such, the exemplary system thus described can be utilized to provide an image pertaining to the birefrigent-scattering (or other polarization-altering) regions in a sample with enhanced contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in the above exemplary cases involving polarized light, a polarization maintaining fiber-optic coupler can be alternatively used with the polarized light source. A polarization rotation means may be optically coupled to the reference PM fiber for rotating the polarization of the reference beam, so as to select the desired polarization of the observation beam. Moreover, an unpolarized light source along with a polarizing beamsplitter can be used to provide a polarized illumination beam and a polarized reference beam with orthogonal polarization. A disadvantage of using an unpolarized light source is, however, that the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams cannot be efficiently adjusted to best suit a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an alternative embodiment of an angled-dual-axis optical coherence microscope, comprising a light source equipped with dual output-ports, an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope as previously described, and a reference optical fiber. A first output-port of the light source is optically coupled to the first optical fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, transmitting an illumination beam. A second output-port of the light source is optically coupled to the reference optical fiber, providing a reference beam. An observation beam collected by the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope is delivered by way of the second optical fiber, and is in turn combined with the reference beam such that coherent interference is produced for detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiment, the reference and second optical fibers may be joined by a fiber-optic coupler, to provide for a balanced detection scheme. The system further comprises a frequency shifting means optically coupled to the first or second optical fiber of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, such that the frequency of the observation beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. Alternatively, the frequency shifting means can be optically coupled to the reference optical fiber, such that the frequency of the reference beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the observation beam. In either case, coherent interference between the reference and observation beams is modulated at a beat frequency, such that heterodyne balanced detection can be utilized. Moreover, an adjustable optical delay device may be coupled to either the reference optical fiber, or the second optical fiber, to maintain coherent interference between the reference and observation beams at the fiber-optic coupler where they are combined. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of detection, an optical amplifier can be coupled to the second optical fiber, so as to boost up the power of the observation beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The light source in the above embodiment is preferably a short coherence length source, such as the type commonly used for optical coherence tomography applications. The light source can also be an optical fiber amplifier, a semiconductor optical amplifier, a fiber laser, a semiconductor laser, or a diode-pumped solid state laser, equipped with dual output-ports. Various optical fibers, such as the first, second, and reference optical fibers, are preferably single-mode fibers, for single-mode fibers have the advantage of simplicity and automatic assurance of the mutual spatial coherence of the observation and reference beams upon mixing and detection. If polarized light is provided by the light source, the first, second, and reference optical fibers are preferably polarization maintaining fibers. To ensure that the reference and observation beams have the same polarization upon detection, either the reference or second optical fiber can be rotated by an appropriate amount before they are joined at the fiber-optic coupler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The angled-dual-axis optical coherence microscope of the present invention, as the above exemplary embodiments demonstrate, offers the advantages of enhanced axial resolution while maintaining a workable working distance, fast and high-precision scanning over a large field of view, while attaining higher sensitivity and larger dynamic range of detection provided by the optical coherence technique. It also advantageously exploits the flexibility, scalability, ruggedness, and low cost afforded by optical fibers. As such, the angled-dual-axis optical coherence microscope of the present invention is particularly suited for applications in which high resolution, high contrast imaging and fast scanning are required, such as in vivo imaging of live tissue for performing optical biopsies in many medical applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the following detailed description contains many specific details for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiment of the invention described below is set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the claimed invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D depict several exemplary embodiments of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head according to the present invention. Depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a first exemplary embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention. Confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, by way of example, comprises a first end <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> serving as a point light source; a first end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> serving as a point light detector; an angled-dual-axis focusing means in the form of a lens assembly consisting of first collimating lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, second collimating lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, illumination lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, observation lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and two beam-aligning elements in the form of first 45-degree mirror <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and second 45-degree mirror <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; an arc-line scanning means in the form of a single scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which can be pivoted about axis <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. First collimating lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, illumination lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and first mirror <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are mounted on first V-groove <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> etched on substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Similarly, second collimating lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, observation lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and second mirror <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are mounted on second V-groove <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> etched on substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. First optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are affixed to cylindrical ferrules <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> respectively, which are in turn mounted on V-grooves <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> respectively, such that fiber ends <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are held in their respective positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In operation, an illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> emerges from first end <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and is directed to first collimating lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The collimated beam is then passed onto and focused by illumination lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The focused beam is further deflected by first mirror <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which in turn directs the beam to a diffraction-limited illumination focal volume (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) within an object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. An observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> emanated from a diffraction-limited, confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is first collected by scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, then directed to second mirror <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which in turn deflects the beam to observation lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is further collimated by observation lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and then focused by second collimating lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to first end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is positioned such that illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> intersect optimally at an angle (&thgr;) within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> provides a more detailed illustration of how illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are arranged to intersect within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, directed by scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, is focused to an illumination focal volume <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> oriented along an illumination axis <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> emanates from an observation focal volume <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> oriented along an observation axis <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is received by scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Illumination axis <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> and observation axis <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are directed to intersect at angle &thgr;, such that illumination focal volume <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and observation focal volume <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> intersect optimally at confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. A three-dimensional x-y-z coordinate system is provided to describe the spatial extents of confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, where the origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The z-axis defines the axial (or vertical) direction, whereas x-axis and y-axis (pointing out of the page) represent two orthogonal transverse directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the term &ldquo;emanating&rdquo; as used in this specification is to be construed in a broad sense as covering any light transmitted back from the object, including reflected light and scattered light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, various optical elements are aberration-corrected, and single-mode optical fibers are used to provide a point light source and detector. Accordingly, illumination focal volume <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and observation focal volume <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> described above are diffraction-limited, defined by the main lobes of the illumination beam&apos;s point-spread function and observation beam&apos;s point-spread function. Confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is likewise diffraction-limited, determined by an optimal overlapping of the main lobes of the illumination beam&apos;s point-spread function and the observation beam&apos;s point-spread function, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Application &apos;118, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a mathematical model for calculating the point-spread functions of two optimally intersecting focused beams, such as illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, thereby providing an estimate of the three-dimensional extents of the resulting confocal overlapping volume, e.g., confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. As the exemplary model calculations and accompanying graphs in application &apos;118 indicate, the confocal overlapping volume displays Gaussian-like characteristics in x, y, and z directions, diminishing rapidly and monotonically (i.e., there are no additional side-bands) with increasing distance from the center of the two-beam overlapping region. Such characteristics define a sharp resolution in both the axial as well as transverse directions. As a way of example, for an angled-dual-axis confocal system with an intersecting angle &thgr; (&equals;2&agr;) equal to 60&deg; and NA of the objective lenses about 0.25, the corresponding axial resolution is approximately 2.8 microns, and the transverse resolutions about 1.6 and 1.4 microns, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Now referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, by rotating about axis <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at a variable angle &phgr;, scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is further capable of pivoting illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> jointly in such a way that illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> remain intersecting optimally at angle <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> at the intersection of the two beams moves along an arc-line within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, thereby producing an arc-line scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that an important characteristic of the arc-line scan described above is that the relative spatial orientation between illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> stays fixed in the course of the entire scan, once the two beams are arranged to intersect in an optimal manner initially. This is in distinct contrast to the prior art confocal theta scanning systems, where the illumination and observation beams need to be separately adjusted at each scan point, in order to ensure an optimal intersection. Consequently, the scans performed by angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention are inherently of higher precision and faster speed, and are also less laborious to carry out. Another notable feature of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention is that the illumination and observation beam paths can be exchanged, without affecting its performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> shows a second exemplary embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention. In angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, an illumination reflective focusing element <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is implemented to replace first collimating lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, illumination lens <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and first mirror <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, providing a dual function of focusing and deflecting illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Likewise, an observation reflective focusing element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is used to replace second mirror <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, observation lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and second collimating lens <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, providing a dual function of focusing and deflecting observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The remainder of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shares the same components with angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. By way of example, illumination and observation reflective focusing elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are in the form of two diffractive lenses with reflective coatings. The proper design of such reflective diffraction lenses can be determined by commercially available computer modeling programs and is well known in the art of diffractive lens design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Illumination and observation reflective focussing elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can alternatively be in the form of curved mirrors. In some cases of using curved mirrors such as ellipsoidal mirrors (each having two foci), it is desirable to place fiber ends <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the respective first focal points of the two ellipsoidal mirrors serving as illumination and observation focusing elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, thereby focusing illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> at the respective second focal points of focusing elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. All in all, the overall operation of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is similar to the working of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> depicts a simplified schematic illustration of a third exemplary embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention. Angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> comprises a first end <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of a first optical fiber <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> serving as a point light source; a first end <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of a second optical fiber <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> serving as a point light detector; an angled-dual-axis focusing means in the form of a lens assembly consisting of first collimating lens <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, second collimating lens <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, and illumination-observation lens <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>; and an arc-line scanning means in the form of a single scanning mirror <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> having a pivoting axis <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In operation, an illumination beam <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> emerges from first end <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of first optical fiber <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> and is directed to first collimating lens <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. The collimated beam is then passed onto and focused by illumination-observation lens <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. The focused beam reflects off scanning mirror <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> at first impingement spot <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, and is further directed to a diffraction-limited illumination focal volume (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>) within an object <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. An observation beam <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> emanated from a diffraction-limited, confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is first received by scanning mirror <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> at second impingement spot <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, further passed onto and collimated by illumination observation lens <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. Observation beam <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is then focused by second collimating lens <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to first end <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of second optical fiber <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Scanning mirror <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is positioned such that illumination beam <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> intersect optimally at an angle (&thgr;) within confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. By rotating about axis <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, scanning mirror <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is further capable of pivoting illumination beam <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> jointly in such a way that illumination beam <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> remain intersecting optimally at angle &thgr; and confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> at the intersection of the two beams moves along an arc-line within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, thereby producing an arc-line scan, as in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in an angled-dual-axis arrangement of the present invention, as the above exemplary embodiments depict, since the observation beam is positioned at an angle relative to the illumination beam, scattered light along the illumination beam does not easily get passed into the observation beam, except where the beams overlap. This substantially reduces scattered photon noise in the observation beam, thus enhancing the sensitivity and dynamic range of detection. This is in contrast to the direct coupling of scattered photon noise between the illumination and observation beams in a transmission or reciprocal confocal microscope, due to the collinear arrangement between the beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by using low NA focusing elements (or lenses) in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning system of the present invention, the illumination and observation beams do not become overlapping until very close to the focus. Such an arrangement prevents additional scattered light in the illumination beam from directly &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; to the observation beam, hence further filtering out multiple-scattered photon noise in the observation beam. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not eliminate multiple-scattered photon noise that originates within the observation beam. The present invention employs a temporal gating technique, to filter out this source of noise. Altogether, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning system of the present invention has much lower noise and is capable of providing much higher contrast when imaging in a highly scattering medium than the prior art confocal systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D serve to illustrate only three of many embodiments of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention. In general, the angled-dual-axis focusing means in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention comprises an assembly of one or more elements for beam focusing, collimating, aligning, and deflecting, as exemplified in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D. Such elements can be in the form of refractive lenses, diffractive lenses, GRIN lenses, focusing gratings, micro-lenses, holographic optical elements, binary lenses, curved mirrors, flat mirrors, prisms and the like. A crucial feature of the angled-dual-axis focusing means is that it provides an illumination axis and an observation axis that intersect at an angle, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. The arc-line scanning means in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention generally comprises an element selected from the group consisting of scanning mirrors, reflectors, acousto-optic deflectors, electro-optic deflectors, mechanical scanning mechanisms, and Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) scanning micro-mirrors. A key feature is that the arc-line scanning means is in the form of a single element, as opposed to two or more separately functioning scanning elements in prior art confocal scanning systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A preferred choice for the arc-line scanning means is a flat pivoting mirror, particularly a silicon micro-machined scanning mirror for its compact and light-weight construction. (Note: to achieve faster scanning, the scanning means can be in the form of two smaller coplanar pivoting mirrors, such as two silicon micro-machined scanning mirrors. Owing to their unique fabrication process, these mirrors can be operated in substantially synchronous motion and constructed to co-rotate about a common axis so as to scan illumination and observation beams in a way functionally equivalent to a larger single scanning mirror.) The fabrication processes of silicon scanning mirrors are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,007,208, 6,057,952, 5,872,880, 6,044,705, 5,648,618, 5,969,465, and 5,629,790. The optical fibers in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention can be single-mode fibers, multi-mode fibers, birefrigent fibers, polarization maintaining fibers and the like. Single-mode fibers are preferable, however, for the ends of single-mode fibers provide a nearly point-like light source and detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A unique feature of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention is that the arc-line scanning means is placed between the angled-dual-axis focusing means and the object to be examined. This enables the best on-axis illumination and observation point-spread functions to be utilized throughout the entire angular range of an arc-line scan, thereby providing greater resolution over a larger transverse field of view, while maintaining diffraction-limited performance. Such an arrangement is made possible by taking advantage of the longer working distance rendered by using relatively lower NA focusing elements or lenses in the angled-dual-axis focusing means. For example, in the present invention, molded aspherical lenses with NA ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 that are low cost and readily available in the art may be used. Such lenses have excellent on-axis aberration correction, and are therefore diffraction-limited for on-axis focusing conditions. These lenses normally do not have diffraction-limited performance when focusing off-axis, and thus cannot be used in confocal scanning systems where off-axis performance is important. Such is the case in prior art confocal scanning systems described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,973,828 and 6,064,518, where the field of view is limited by the off-axis performance of the objective lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the specific arrangements among various optical elements and optical fibers in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head can be altered in many ways without deviating from the principle and the scope of the present invention. For instance, the use of collimating lenses and beam-aligning mirrors, such as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> to help facilitate the shaping and alignment of the illumination and observation beams, can be optional and vary with the nature of practical applications. Other auxiliary optical elements may also be implemented in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention, to enhance the overall performance. All in all, a skilled artisan will know how to design an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head in accordance with the principle of the present invention, to best suit a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> By integrating its constituent optical elements on a silicon substrate, as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1C</cross-reference> by way of silicon fabrication techniques, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention renders a high degree of integrity, maneuverability, scalability, and versatility. Such a design also provides greater flexibility and higher precision in the alignment of various optical elements. Although the particular way of making an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention an integrated device is dictated by the nature of a given application, a silicon substrate is generally preferred, for it is well known in the art that various V-grooves can be etched on silicon in a very precise manner, as demonstrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,007,208 and 5,872,880. The precision of the V-grooves provides an accurate and secure optical alignment among various optical elements hosted by these V-grooves, enabling the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head thus constructed to be a reliable and modular device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Using the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> as a way of example, mirrors <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be rotated about their respective axes and translated along V-grooves <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> respectively, to facilitate the optimal intersection of illumination and observation beams <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Illumination and observation lenses <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can also be translated along V-grooves <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> respectively, to further facilitate the optimal overlapping of illumination and observation focal volumes <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. Such alignment procedures can be performed before affixing (e.g., by means of gluing) various optical elements to their respective V-grooves. The scalability and relatively low cost of silicon fabrication technology add further advantages to this approach. For example, a micro-optic version of such an integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head can be incorporated in miniature surgical devices, endoscopes, or other in situ devices, suitable for medical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To provide a two-dimensional scan, an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention can be mechanically coupled to a vertical scanning means in the form of a vertical scanning unit comprising a vertical translation means and a compensation means. The vertical translation means causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move toward or away from the object and hence the illumination and observation beams to probe further into the interior of the object, thereby producing a vertical scan. A two-dimensional vertical cross-section scan of the object is then obtained by assembling a plurality of arc-line scans that progressively deepen into the object. The compensation means keeps the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams substantially unchanged, thereby ensuring the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation focal volumes in the course of vertical scanning. This compensation function is also crucial for performing optical coherence microscopy. The combination of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and the vertical scanning unit thus described constitutes a first embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. Angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, by way of example, comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head (ADACSH) <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and a vertical translation means in the form of a movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of illustration, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is in a simplified schematic form of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> (or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), although any other embodiments according to the present invention can be equivalently utilized. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is attached to and further enclosed in movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, with optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extending to the outside of movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. A first transparent window <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is mounted on movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for passage of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can move up and down in a vertical direction as defined by arrow <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, causing angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to move toward or away from object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the process. By doing so, confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> further deepen into (or retract from) the interior of object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, whereby a succession of arc-line scans that progressively deepen into object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> along a vertical cross-section plane <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is produced, as illustrated by curves <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, providing a vertical cross-section scan. The motion of movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be driven by a variety of means, for instance, by coupling it to a motor (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) that is activated by a magnetic, hydraulic, piezoelectric, or other actuator. A skilled artisan can accordingly implement a movable stage suitable for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, to provide a two-dimensional transverse cross-sectional scan, a scanning mirror means capable of rotating in two orthogonal directions can be implemented in an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention, such as in one of the exemplary embodiments described above. Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention. As a way of example, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is constructed in a way similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and hence shares some of the elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, as indicated by those identified with the same numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, substituting single scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a bi-axial scanning element <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the form of a gimbaled assembly of a scanning mirror <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and a frame <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Bi-axial scanning element <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is configured such that scanning mirror <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can rotate about a first pivoting axis <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (indicated by &phgr;), whereas frame <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> along with scanning mirror <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can rotate about a second pivoting axis <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> (indicated by &agr;), thereby providing rotation (&phgr;,&agr;) in two orthogonal directions. (First and second pivoting axes <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are configured to be substantially orthogonal in this case.) Transverse cross-section scans can be accomplished by way of arc-line scanning in two orthogonal directions using a bi-axial scanning mirror (which pivots about two orthogonal axes) as the scanning means of the present invention. Such bi-axial scanning mirrors are known in the art, for example, MEMS type silicon bi-axial scanning mirrors are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,742,419; 6,007,208 and 6,057,952. Also, an aluminum bi-axial scanning mirror using flexure-type hinges is produced by Newport Corporation (Irvine, Calif.) for fast steering of laser beams about two orthogonal axes (Newport catalog, page 369). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the vertical scanning unit as described above is capable of causing the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move relative to the object being scanned in such a way that a succession of transverse cross-sectional scans that progressively deepen into the object can be produced, providing transverse cross-sectional scans at varying depths within the object. In some cases, where a single transverse cross-sectional scan is desired at a particular depth, then the vertical scanning unit of the present invention can function as a means of selecting the particular depth of a transverse cross-sectional scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> deepen into the interior of object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the course of vertical scanning, the change in their respective optical path lengths becomes increasingly large, which may cause their respective focal volumes to no longer intersect in an optimal manner, or even not to intersect at all at the point where the two beams physically meet. Furthermore, in interferometry applications such as optical coherence microscopy, the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> must stay substantially fixed in order to ensure coherent interference of predominantly single-scattered light. To maintain the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> during vertical scanning, the space between movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be filled with a substantially transparent fluid <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> having an index of refraction that is substantially the same as the index of refraction of object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such that the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> remain unchanged in the course of vertical scanning. The use of optical fibers further provides the necessary flexibility that enables the whole assembly of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to move up and down without incurring additional change in the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, along with angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, is disposed within a container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> filled with fluid <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. An O-ring seal <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is provided to seal fluid <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> inside container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, while still permitting movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to move up and down relative to container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is equipped with a second transparent window <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, in optical alignment with first transparent window <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> for passage of illumination and observation beams <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is further connected to a fluid injection system <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, serving as a reservoir for replenishing additional fluid or receiving excess fluid as movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is moving towards or away from object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For imaging of human tissue and other biological samples, fluid <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be water, which has an index of refraction closely matching that of tissue and biological samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that certain aberrations of the illumination and observation beams may occur as a result of successive passages of the beams through first and second transparent windows <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, fluid <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment, which may require specific designs of the illumination and observation focusing elements that are corrected for these aberrations. Alternatively, auxiliary optical elements that are properly designed for correcting such aberrations may be implemented in the angled-dual-axis focusing means. In most cases of a converging beam passing through a window or into another object at an inclined angle, the primary aberrations to be corrected for will be spherical aberration, astigmatism, and coma. The magnitude of these aberrations depend upon many factors, and typically increases with NA of the focusing elements, the index of refraction and the thickness of the window, and the angle of incidence. The design of such aberration-corrected focusing elements, or the auxiliary optical elements for correcting aberrations, can be accomplished by a lens designer of ordinary skill and with the help of an optical design computer program such as Zemax&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In applications where the NA of the focusing elements in the angled-dual-axis focusing means are sufficiently low and the thicknesses of windows, fluid and object through which the illumination and observation beams successively traverse are not large, the aberrations would be small and may not need to be corrected. In such cases, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> can be utilized, which may incorporate additional remedies for further minimizing aberrations. Such remedies include, for example, using windows made of Teflon AF&trade; or other materials that are transparent and have an index of refraction closely matching that of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> depicts a second embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention, pertaining to applications where the aforementioned aberrations may not be negligible. In angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a window assembly comprising two flat transparent windows <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> in an angled arrangement is implemented to replace single flat window <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The remainder of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> shares the same components as angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The window assembly is designed such that illumination axis <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> along with illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation axis <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> along with observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) are substantially perpendicular to windows <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, respectively. As such, the window assembly can greatly reduce coma and astigmatism that would otherwise be associated with using a single flat window (such as window <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). Although spherical aberrations still need to be corrected for in this case, the techniques for making such corrections are well known in the art of lens design. For instance, a skilled artisan can make use of the design of microscope objectives that are corrected for glass coverslips of a certain thickness to accomplish this task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> All in all, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the present invention is designed such that it provides a vertical cross-section scan of an object with enhanced axial resolution, faster speed, and larger transverse field of view. Moreover, by moving angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, or translating the object, in a transverse direction perpendicular to vertical cross-section plane <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> series of vertical cross-section scans can be taken in a layer-by-layer fashion, which can be assembled to provide a three-dimensional volume image of the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> depicts a third embodiment of an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention. Angled-dual-axis confocal microscope <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, by way of example, comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal head (ADACH) <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, a vertical translation means in the form of a movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and a transverse scanning means in the form of transverse stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. For the purpose of illustration, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is in a simplified schematic form of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> (or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), although any other embodiments according to the present invention can be equivalently utilized. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, angled-dual-axis confocal head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is attached to and further enclosed in movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, with first and second optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extending to the outside of movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. A first transparent window <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is mounted on movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> for passage of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Driven by a motor <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, movable carriage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can move up and down along a vertical (or axial) direction as defined by arrow <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, causing angled-dual-axis confocal head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> to move toward or away from object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the process. By doing so, confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> deepens into (or retracts from) the interior of object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, whereby producing a vertical scan. Motor <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> can be actuated by a variety of means, such as magnetic, hydraulic, piezoelectric, and other actuators. A skilled artisan can accordingly devise a movable carriage mechanically driven by a motor suitable for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, along with angled-dual-axis confocal head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, is disposed within a container <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> filled with a substantially transparent fluid <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> having an index of refraction that is substantially the same as the index of refraction of object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such that the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> remain substantially unchanged in the course of vertical scanning. The use of optical fibers further provides the necessary flexibility that enables the whole assembly of angled-dual-axis confocal head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to move up and down without incurring additional changes in the optical path lengths of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. An O-ring seal <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> is provided to seal fluid <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> inside container <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, while still permitting movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to move up and down relative to container <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>. A second transparent window <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is mounted on container <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, such that it is in optical communication with first transparent window <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> for passage of illumination and observation beams <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> is further connected to a fluid injection system <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, serving as a reservoir for replenishing additional fluid or receiving excess fluid as movable carriage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is moving towards or away from object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, fluid <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> can be water, for it has an index of refraction closely matching that of human tissue and other biological samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that a window assembly, similar to the window assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, can be, implemented to replace window <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> in applications where aberrations need to be minimized, as described above. Further minimization of possible aberrations can be accomplished by filling a space between second and third windows <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> with a fluid, which has an index of refraction substantially close to that of fluid <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, distance <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> can be made very small, and second and third windows <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> can be made of Teflon AF&trade;, to further decrease coma and astigmatism. Although spherical aberrations still need to be corrected for in this case, the techniques for making such corrections are well known in the art of lens design. For instance, a skilled artisan can make use of the design of microscope objectives that are corrected for glass coverslips of a certain thickness to accomplish this task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> further comprises a transverse stage <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for producing transverse scans. A third transparent window <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, in optical communication with second transparent window <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, is mounted on transverse stage <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for passage of illumination and observation beams <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in turn placed on third transparent window <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. Transverse stage <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> is mechanically coupled to two or more ball bearings (or wheels) <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, which enable transverse stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> along with object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to translate relative to angled-dual-axis confocal head <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> along transverse directions perpendicular to the vertical direction <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, whereby producing a transverse scan. Ball bearings <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> also serve to keep the distance <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> between second transparent window <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and third transparent window <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> constant, so as to preserve the optical path lengths of illumination and observation beams <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the course of scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As such, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of the present invention is capable of providing transverse and vertical scans in various ways. For example, it can produce a line scan along the vertical direction <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, termed a vertical-line scan hereinafter; a vertical cross-section scan comprising a plurality of vertical-line scans that are assembled along a transverse direction perpendicular to the vertical direction <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>; a line scan along a transverse direction perpendicular to the vertical direction <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, termed a transverse-line scan hereinafter; and a transverse cross-section scan comprising a plurality of transverse-line scans assembled in a transverse plane perpendicular to the vertical direction <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>; and so on. Furthermore, by assembling a plurality of transverse cross-section scans that progressively deepens into the object, by assembling a plurality of vertical cross-section scans that move incrementally in a transverse direction (perpendicular to each vertical cross-section scan), or by assembling an assortment of transverse-line scans along different transverse directions and vertical-line scans, a three-dimensional volume image of the object can be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> For tissue imaging applications, the wavelength of light generally ranges from about 0.8 microns to 1.6 microns, since biological tissue samples are particularly transparent in this range. Embodiments of the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention are capable of achieving a resolution of about 1-5 microns in the axial (e.g., the vertical direction shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C) as well as the transverse directions, by use of illumination and observation lenses with NA typically ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, and the intersecting angle &thgr; typically ranging from 45&deg; to 90&deg;. The vertical cross-section scan area is typically on the order of about 0.5-1 millimeter in both directions. In terms of scanning capabilities, the fast scan rate along an arc-line typically ranges from 1 to 10 KHz, and the maximum rotation angle (e.g., &phgr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) from a neutral position of the scanning mirror (e.g., scanning mirror <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) may range from one to several degrees. Generally, the smaller and the lighter the scanning mirror, the faster the scanning rate. For instance, using a silicon micro-machined scanning mirror can provide scanning rates greater than <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> kHz. The vertical scanning can be performed at a slower rate of 10-60 Hz, which defines the frame rate of vertical cross-section scanning and is in the range of video-rate scanning. Transverse stage <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> scans at a rate slower than the arc-line scanning rate, typically in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The specific numbers provided above are designed for tissue imaging, to illustrate the utility and the performance of the present invention as a way of example. A skilled artisan can utilize the model calculation provided in application &apos;118 to design an angled-dual axis confocal scanning microscope in accordance with the present invention, for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that although optical fibers, particularly single-mode fibers, are preferable as optical coupling means among various optical elements in this invention, and are used throughout this specification wherever optical coupling is called for, other suitable optical coupling means can be alternatively implemented in various angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning systems of this invention, without deviating from the principle and the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In particular, additional embodiments of the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope according to the present invention include replacing first and second optical fibers (illumination fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and observation fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively) of the present invention with first and second single-mode optical waveguides (illumination and observation waveguides, respectively). In general, either of the first or second optical waveguides (not shown) in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head of the present invention can be any type of single-mode waveguide, including, birefringent waveguides, polarization maintaining waveguides, buried waveguides, single-mode fibers, birefringent fibers, polarization maintaining fibers, and the like. Single-mode waveguides (or fibers) are preferable because the ends of single-mode waveguides (or single-mode fibers) provide a nearly point-like light source and detector. Depending upon the particular application, it may be preferable to use a mixture of waveguides and/or fibers. For example, in cases when the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is to be fabricated using integrated optics techniques, then it may be preferable to use buried optical waveguides instead of optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> depicts a first embodiment of an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention. Angled-dual-axis optical coherence microscope <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope (ADACSM) <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a beam-splitting means preferably in the form of a fiber-based beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having a short coherence length, and a reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. By way of example, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is in the form of one of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, although other embodiments in accordance with the present invention can also be implemented. Beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in such a way that it diverts a portion of an output beam emitted from light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, providing an illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and a remainder of the output beam to reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, providing a reference beam. An observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> collected by angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> from confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> within object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is delivered by way of second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and reference fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are joined by a fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, and optical path lengths of first, second and reference fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are so selected to ensure coherent interference upon combining the reference and observation beams at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The two outputs of fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are in turn fed to two optical detectors <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, such that a balanced detection scheme is utilized for optimizing the signal-to-noise of detection. The underlying principle of the balanced detection technique as well as its advantages in fiber-optic interferometers are well known in the art, as described by Rollins et al. in &ldquo;Optimal interferometer designs for optical coherence tomography&rdquo;, Optics Letters, 24(21), pp. 1484 (1999), and by Podoleanu in &ldquo;Unbalanced versus balanced operation in an optical coherence tomography system&rdquo;, Applied Optics, 39(1), pp. 173 (2000), incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> further comprises a frequency shifting means <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> optically coupled to, by way of example, second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of the observation beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. Alternatively, a frequency shifting means may be optically coupled to first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which also results in the frequency of the observation beam being shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. Moreover, a frequency shifting means can be coupled to reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of the reference beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the observation beam. The end result in each case is that coherent interference between the reference and observation beams is modulated at a heterodyne beat frequency given by the relative frequency shift between the two beams, allowing for heterodyne balanced detection. In addition, an adjustable optical delay device <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is coupled to, by way of example, second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain coherent interference between the reference and observation beams at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> where they are combined. An optical delay device may be alternatively coupled to reference fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, or first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for the same purpose. In applications where light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has a short coherence length, optical delay device <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> can be adjusted such that mostly single-scattered light in observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is coherent with the reference beam at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and multiple-scattered light, which traverses over a larger optical path length in observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, does not contribute to the coherent interference, therefore providing further filtering of multiple-scattered light upon detection. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of detection of weak optical signals, an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, such as a two-port fiber amplifier or a semiconductor optical amplifier, is optically coupled to second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to boost up the power of the observation beam. An amplified observation beam has an additional advantage of rendering faster scanning rates and consequently higher pixel rates without appreciable loss in the signal-to-noise ratio, because a shorter integration time per pixel of an image is required upon data collection. The balanced detection scheme allows subtraction of amplifier noise, since preponderance of spontaneous emission of optical amplifier <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> would not occur at the heterodyne beat frequency described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In general, light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment can be an optical fiber amplifier, a semiconductor optical amplifier, a fiber laser, a semiconductor laser, a diode-pumped solid state laser, or a broadband OCT source commonly used in optical coherence tomography applications. It may be polarized, or unpolarized. The light source preferably has a coherence length of less than 3000 microns (for applications involving imaging within a highly scattering medium such as human skin, wavelengths in the range of 0.8 to 1.6 microns typically allow imaging to depths of no more than 3,000 microns). For biological applications, the light source should produce light in the wavelength range of 0.8 to 1.6 microns, since biological tissues are particularly transparent in this range. Beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be a fiber-optic coupler, such as an evanescent wave coupler or a fused fiber coupler. Various optical fibers, such as first, second, and reference optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, are preferably single-mode fibers, for single-mode fibers have the advantage of simplicity and automatic assurance of the mutual spatial coherence of the observation and reference beams upon mixing and detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In one case where light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment produces polarized light and beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is a polarizing beamsplitter, the orientation of polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> relative to the polarization of the light can be used to control the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams. First, second, and reference optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are preferably polarization maintaining (PM) fibers, to provide control of the polarizations of the illumination, observation and reference beams throughout the system. In this case, the reference and observation beams can be brought into the same polarization by an appropriate rotation of second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, before they are joined at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a polarization rotation means, such as a Faraday rotator or a rotatable fiber connector, can be coupled to either reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> or second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such that the reference and observation beams have substantially the same polarization when combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In another case where light source <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is a polarized light source, beamsplitter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may alternatively be a polarization maintaining fiber-optic coupler. Likewise, polarization maintaining fibers should be implemented throughout the system, to provide control of the polarization states of the beams, thereby ensuring maximum coherent interference between the observation and reference beams upon being combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The embodiment described above can be further used to provide specific information pertaining to the polarization state of light upon being reflected from a polarization-altering, such as birefrigent-scattering, medium. Many biological tissues, such as tendons, muscle, nerve, bone, cartilage and teeth, exhibit birefrigence due to their linear or fibrous structure. Birefrigence causes the polarization state of light to be altered (e.g., rotated) in a prescribed manner upon refection. Skin is another birefrigent medium. Collagen contained in skin is a weakly birefrigent material. Moreover, at temperatures between 56-65&deg; C., collagen denatures and loses its birefrigence. Thus, by detecting induced changes in the polarization state of light reflected from a skin sample, an image representing the regions of skin where thermal injury occurs can be identified. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> depicts a second embodiment of an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention, pertaining to applications where polarized light is used to probe a birefrigent-scattering (or other polarization-altering) medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> By way of example, angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope (ADACSM) <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, a polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, a polarized light source <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, and a reference polarization maintaining (PM) optical fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> is in the form of one of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, with first and second optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being polarization maintaining (PM) fibers capable of supporting two orthogonal polarizations. Polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to polarized light source <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> by way of a third PM fiber <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight>, such that it diverts a portion of a polarized output beam emitted from light source <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> to first PM fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, providing an illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> with P-polarization to angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, and a remainder of the output beam to reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, providing a reference beam with S-polarization. P-polarization and S-polarization are orthogonal to each other. The orientation of polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> relative to the polarization of the output beam from light source <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> can be used to control the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams. An observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> reflected from confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> within an object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> carries both P-polarization and S-polarization, where the presence of S-polarization is resulted from birefrigent (or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A frequency shifting means <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. Second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> are joined by a polarization maintaining (PM) fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, where only observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> with S-polarization is coherently combined with the reference beam that has only S-polarization. The two outputs of fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> are in turn fed to two optical detectors <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight>, so as to utilize balanced detection scheme for optimizing the signal-to-noise of detection. The amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal, i.e, S-Polarized Signal depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, corresponds only to the amplitude of reflectance of light with S-polarization, from which an image representing birefrigent (and/or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be constructed. Take skin as an example. If thermal damage occurs to a skin sample, the amplitude of S-polarized Signal depicted would be reduced compared to that corresponding to normal skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, a frequency shifting means may be alternatively coupled to reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of the reference beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the observation beam. A frequency shifting means may be also coupled to first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for shifting the frequency of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and hence observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> relative to the frequency of the reference beam. In each case the end result is that coherent interference between the reference and observation beams is modulated at a heterodyne beat frequency given by the relative frequency shift between the two beams, allowing for heterodyne balanced detection. In addition, an adjustable optical delay device <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> is coupled to, by way of example, second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain coherent interference between the reference and observation beams at PM fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> where they are combined. An optical delay device may be alternatively coupled to reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, or first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In each case, the optical delay device can also be adjusted to provide further filtering of multiple-scattered light upon detection, as described above. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio upon detection, an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, such as a two-port fiber amplifier or semiconductor optical amplifier, is coupled to second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to boost up the power of the observation beam. An amplified observation beam brings an additional advantage of allowing faster scanning rates and consequently higher pixel rates without appreciable loss in the signal-to-noise ratio, because a shorter integration time per pixel of an image is required upon data collection. The use of balanced detection in this case allows subtraction of amplifier noise, since spontaneous emission of optical amplifier <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> would not occur at the heterodyne beat frequency described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the aforementioned embodiment can also be used to detect P-polarization of the observation beam, if so desired in a given application. In such a case, a polarization rotation means, such as a rotatable fiber connector or a Faraday rotator, can be coupled to reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, serving to rotate the polarization of the reference beam by 90-degree and hence rendering a reference beam with P-polarization. Upon combining the reference and observation beams at PM fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, only the observation beam with P-polarization interferes coherently with the reference beam that now has only P-polarization. As such, the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal measures only the amplitude of reflectance of light with P-polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> can be further modified to allow both P-polarization and S-polarization of the observation beam to be detected, hence providing enhanced contrast of an image pertaining to birefrigent-scattering (and/or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in an object. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention. Angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, by way of example, comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope (ADACSM) <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>, a first polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, a polarized light source <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight>, and a reference polarization maintaining (PM) optical fiber <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> is in the form of one of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, with first and second optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being polarization maintaining (PM) fibers capable of supporting two orthogonal polarizations. Polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to polarized light source <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> by way of a third PM fiber <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, such that it diverts a portion of a polarized output beam emitted from light source <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> to first PM fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, providing an illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> with P-polarization to angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>, and a remainder of the output beam to reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, providing a reference beam with S-polarization. P-polarization and S-polarization are mutually orthogonal. The orientation of polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> relative to the polarization of the output beam from light source <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> can be used to control the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams. An observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> reflected from confocal overlapping volume <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> within an object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> carries both P-polarization and S-polarization, owing to birefrigent (or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A frequency shifting means <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to first PM fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and hence the frequency of observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are shifted relative to the reference beam. Second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to a second polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>, which routes S-polarization and P-polarization of observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to forth PM fiber <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> and fifth PM fiber <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight>, respectively. Reference PM fiber <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to a polarization rotation means <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, such as a rotatable fiber-optic connector or a Faraday rotator, serving to rotate the polarization of the reference beam by 45-degree, effectively rendering the reference beam with both P-polarization and S-polarization. A third polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> in turn receives the reference beam from polarization rotation means <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, and routes S-polarization and P-polarization of the reference beam to sixth PM fiber <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> and seventh PM fiber <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, respectively. Fourth PM fiber <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> and sixth PM fiber <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> are joined by a first polarization maintaining (PM) fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, where S-polarization of the observation beam is coherently combined with S-polarization of the reference beam. Illustrated as S-Polarized Signal in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal provides a measure of the amplitude of reflectance of light with S-polarization. The two outputs of first polarization maintaining (PM) fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> are fed to first and second optical detectors <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, such that balanced heterodyne detection scheme is utilized for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of detection. Likewise, fifth PM fiber <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> and seventh PM fiber <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> are joined by a second polarization maintaining (PM) fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>, where P-polarization of the observation beam is coherently combined with P-polarization of the reference beam. Illustrated as P-Polarized Signal in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the amplitude of resulting heterodyne beat frequency signal measures only the amplitude of reflectance of light with P-polarization. The two outputs of second polarization maintaining (PM) fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> are fed to third and fourth optical detectors <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>, to provide for a balanced heterodyne detection scheme. The simultaneous detection of both P-polarization and S-polarization of the observation beam yields an enhanced contrast image representing birefrigent (and/or other polarization-altering) &ldquo;scatterers&rdquo; in object <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, P-Polarized Signal and S-Polarized Signal can be combined in various ways to produce a polarization image, such as &lsqb;(P-Polarized Signal)-(S-Polarized Signal)&rsqb;/&lsqb;(P-Polarized Signal)&plus;(S-Polarized Signal)&rsqb;. This particular way of processing the signals can help discriminate the portion of light reflected by the polarization-altering scatterers from the portion of light that is randomly polarized by multiple-scattered events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> further comprises a first adjustable optical delay device <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> optically coupled to, by way of example, sixth PM fiber <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>, to maintain coherent interference between the S-polarized reference and observation beams upon mixing and detection. An adjustable optical delay device may be alternatively coupled to fourth PM fiber <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, to achieve the same purpose. Moreover, a second adjustable optical delay device <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to, by way of example, seventh PM fiber <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, to maintain coherent interference between the P-polarized reference and observation beams upon mixing and detection. An adjustable optical delay device can be alternatively coupled to fifth PM fiber <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight>, for the same purpose. Separate optical delay adjustments for P-polarization and S-polarization are necessary, because the polarization mode dispersion (PDM) of the PM fibers causes the two orthogonal polarization modes to travel over different optical path lengths along a given length of the PM fiber. Therefore, these optical delay devices can be separately adjusted to provide coherence interference of the two beams in each polarization mode. In addition, an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, such as a two-port polarization-sensitive fiber optical amplifier or semiconductor optical amplifier, is optically coupled to second PM fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, to boost up the power of the observation beam. An amplified observation beam allows faster scanning rates and consequently higher pixel rates without appreciable loss in the signal-to-noise ratio, because a shorter integration time per pixel of an image is required upon data collection. The balanced heterodyne detection schemes implemented for measuring both S-polarized and P-polarized signals enable the amplifier noise to be subtracted in each case, since preponderance of spontaneous emission of optical amplifier <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> would not occur at the heterodyne beat frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, various optical fibers employed are preferably single-mode, polarization maintaining fibers capable of supporting two orthogonal polarizations. The polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in the interferometer can be minimized by use of short single-mode fiber lengths in the arms of the observation and reference beams, as a particular application warrants. If other types of optical fibers are to be alternatively employed in the system, it would be preferable to implement fiber-optic polarization controllers accordingly in the arms of the interferometer, so as to provide control of the polarizations of the observation and reference beams. The use of such fiber-optic polarization controllers with non PM single-mode fibers is well known in the art of optical coherence tomography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that light source <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> (or light source <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>) can be an unpolarized light source, in general. In such a case, the use of polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> (or polarizing beamsplitter <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>) would generate a polarized illumination beam and a polarized reference beam with orthogonal polarizations from an unpolarized beam emitted from the light source. A disadvantage of using an unpolarized light source is, however, that the ratio of optical power between the illumination and reference beams cannot be efficiently adjusted to best suit a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In all cases involving polarized light, it is important to carefully control the polarization states of the observation and reference beams, such that coherent interference between the two beams is maximized when combined. Those skilled in the art of fiber-optic interferometers or gyroscopes will know how to implement various polarization maintaining and/or controlling means to achieve this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a fourth embodiment of an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention. Angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> comprises an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope (ADACSM) <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and a reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. A first output port <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, transmitting an illumination beam <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. A second output port <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, providing a reference beam. An observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> collected by angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is delivered by way of second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are further joined by a fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and optical path lengths of first, second and reference fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, are so selected to ensure coherent interference upon combining the reference and observation beams at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The two outputs of fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are fed to two optical detectors <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, such that a balanced detection scheme is utilized for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> further comprises a frequency shifting means <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> optically coupled, by way of example, second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of observation beam <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is shifted relative to the frequency of the reference beam. A frequency shifting means can also be coupled to first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for the same purpose of shifting the frequency of the observation beam. Alternatively, a frequency shifting means may be optically coupled to reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, such that the frequency of the reference beam is shifted relative to the frequency of the observation beam. The end result in each case is that coherent interference between the reference and observation beams is modulated at a heterodyne beat frequency given by the relative frequency shift between the two beams, allowing for heterodyne balanced detection. In addition, an adjustable optical delay device <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to, by way of example, second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain coherent interference between the reference and observation beams at fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> where they are combined. An optical delay device may be alternatively coupled to reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, or first optical fiber <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In each case, the optical delay device can also be adjusted to provide further filtering of multiple-scattered light upon detection, as described above. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of detection of weak optical signals, an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, such as a two-port fiber amplifier or a semiconductor optical amplifier, is optically coupled to second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to boost up the power of the observation beam. An amplified observation beam allows faster scanning rates and consequently higher pixel rates without appreciable loss in the signal-to-noise ratio, because a shorter integration time per pixel of an image is required upon data collection. The balanced detection scheme allows subtraction of amplifier noise, since preponderance of spontaneous emission of optical amplifier <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> would not occur at the heterodyne beat frequency described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in the above embodiment is preferably a short coherence length source, such as an OCT source commonly used for OCT applications that is modified to have two output-ports. The light source can also be an optical fiber amplifier, a semiconductor optical amplifier, a fiber laser, a semiconductor laser, or a diode-pumped solid state laser, equipped with dual output-ports. The light source preferably has a coherence length of less than 3000 microns. For biological applications, the light source should produce light in the wavelength range of 0.8 to 1.6 microns, since biological tissues are particularly transparent in this range. Various optical fibers, such as first, second, and reference optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, are preferably single-mode fibers, for single-mode fibers have the advantage of simplicity and automatic assurance of the mutual spatial coherence of the observation and reference beams upon mixing and detection. If polarized light is provided by light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, first, second, and reference optical fibers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, are preferably polarization maintaining fibers. In such a case, the reference and observation beams can be brought into the same polarization by an appropriate rotation of either second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, before they are joined by fiber-optic coupler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a polarization rotation means, such as a Faraday rotator or a rotatable fiber connector, can be optically coupled to either reference optical fiber <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> or second optical fiber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such that the reference and observation beams have substantially the same polarization when combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> can be further modified, in ways similar to the embodiments depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, to image a polarization-altering (e.g., a birefrigent-scattering) medium. Those skilled in the art can implement such modifications in accordance with the present invention for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that to provide the frequency shifting means, a phase modulator can be implemented in the embodiments describe above for modulating the phase of either the reference or observation beam, such that heterodyne coherent interference is produced between the reference and observation beams. The phase modulator can be a piezoelectric fiber stretcher, an electro-optic crystal, an acousto-optic modulator, or any other phase modulator known in the art. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art of heterodyne interferometry techniques that there exist many ways of modulating the phase or shifting the frequency of the observation beam (or the reference beam), such that a detectable beat frequency is generated for detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As described above, the angled-dual-axis arrangement between the illumination and observation beams in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention has an inherent advantage of filtering out multiple-scattered light in the illumination beam. And multiple-scattered light can be further eliminated by employing low NA focusing elements (or lenses) in the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope. In an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention, as exemplified by the embodiments depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, multiple-scattered light that originates within the observation beam can be additionally minimized, since the multiple-scattered light in the observation beam are not coherent with the reference beam, owing to the fact that multiple-scattered light travels over a longer optical path length than single-scattered light upon mixing with the reference beam. As such, an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention can achieve much higher sensitivity and larger dynamic range in detection, and hence enhanced contrast when imaging within a scattering medium. This capability is particularly desirable when imaging in a highly scattering medium, such as biological tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> All in all, the unique design of the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention enables it to achieve many advantages concurrently, as stated throughout this specification, in contrast to many prior art systems where an improvement in one property often occurs at the expense of adversely affecting another property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When using an angled-dual-axis optical coherence system to scan an object in order to create an image, the beat frequency resulting from heterodyne interference of the reference and observation beams should be selected with consideration of the scanning rate carried out the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope in the system. More specifically, the beat frequency should be substantially higher than the rate at which pixels inside the object are measured, such that the interference magnitude is measured over several cycles. The highest possible resolution of the image corresponds to the dimensions of the confocal overlapping volume, and proper sampling of a region to be imaged requires that more than two pixels per image point be obtained. For example, if pixels are measured at a rate of 1 MHz (fast enough for video), then the beat frequency should be at least about 10 MHz. This will provide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> interference fringes per pixel, which is sufficient to provide an accurate measure of the reflectance of each pixel. The pixel scanning speed and the beat frequency may depend upon the particular application, of course. If high accuracy is required of the reflectance measurements, then the beat frequency may be increased or the pixel scanning rate may be reduced. Those skilled in the art can accordingly devise a working relationship between the pixel scanning rate and the corresponding beat frequency for a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the embodiments shown FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provide only a few of many angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscopes in accordance with the present invention. A skilled artisan may alter those exemplary embodiments in various ways, so as to best suit practical applications, without deviating from the principle and the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations can be made herein without departing from the principle and the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be determined by the following claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>
