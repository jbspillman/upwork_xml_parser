<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a normally closed liquid crystal display device, particularly to such a liquid crystal display device incorporating an in-plane switching (IPS) mode which is operated by applying an electric field to the liquid crystal layer in the direction substantially parallel to the substrate plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In liquid crystal display devices, the dark level of dark display is a decisive factor for the contrast ratio. The principal causes of worsening the dark level of dark display are the improper conditions of pixel and electrode ends, low frame response and light leakage at the periphery of the spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Variations in thickness of the liquid crystal layer in these liquid crystal display devices lead to serious deterioration of display qualities such as reduction of contrast, nonuniformity of luminance and color shading, so that the spacers are required for keeping the uniform thickness of the liquid crystal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Provision of such spacers, however, is causative of light leakage as it disturbs alignment of the liquid crystal molecules around the spacer surface. The higher the in-plane distribution density of spacers, the more effective for suppressing variation of thickness of the liquid crystal layer, but at the same time this may invite a greater decrease of contrast ratio. Also, light leakage at the periphery of the spacer tends to provoke a sense of glaringness which hinders appearance of uniform blackness of the picture when the display mode changes from dark to gray scale, and may also cause nonuniformity of luminance due to localized distribution of the spacers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the normally closed liquid crystal display devices of the twisted nematic (TN) mode in which an electric field is applied along the direction perpendicular to the substrates, a method for minimizing light leakage at the spacer periphery by incorporating a mechanism for vertically aligning the liquid crystal molecules in the spacer surface has been proposed (JP-A-4-177324, etc.). This method is indeed effective in the normally closed liquid crystal display devices of the TN mode, but no disclosure is made on the technique for reducing or eliminating light leakage which occurs specifically in the IPS mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices to which the conception of the present invention is directed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the conventional TN mode normally open liquid crystal display devices, dark display is obtained in a state where a high voltage is applied. In this case, most of the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the direction of the electric field which is normal to the substrate surface, and the black level is obtained under a specific relationship between the alignment of liquid crystal molecules and the disposition of polarizer. Therefore, uniformity of the black level is, in principle, not much dependent on the state of initial alignment under low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, the human eye recognizes the nonuniformity of luminance as a relative ratio of luminance and shows a reaction close to logarithmic scale, so that it is sensitive to the variation of black level. In this connection, the conventional TN mode normally open liquid crystal display devices, in which the liquid crystal molecules are forcibly aligned in one direction under high voltage, are insensitive to the state of initial alignment and advantageous in this respect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the IPS mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices are very sensitive to disturbance of the state of initial alignment as the black level is displayed at low or zero voltage in these display devices. Particularly in the configuration of birefrigent mode in which the liquid crystal molecules take homogeneous alignment, i.e. they are aligned parallel to each other on the upper and lower substrates, and wherein one of the polarizers is arranged so that its light transmission axis will be parallel to the direction of alignment of the liquid crystal molecules while the other polarizer is arranged orthogonal thereto, the polarized light incident on the liquid crystal layer is allowed to propagate with little disturbance of linear polarization. This is effective for darkening black the dark level and allows ideal black display in principle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Ideal black display in principle is indeed realized, but on the other hand, only slight disturbance of initial alignment may directly lead to the initiation of light leakage, causing impediment of darkness in black display and degradation of the black level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Transmittance T in the birefrigent mode in an IPS mode liquid crystal display devices is generally given by the following equation (1): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T&equals;T</italic></highlight>0&middot;sin2&lcub;2&thgr;(<highlight><italic>E</italic></highlight>))&middot;sin2&lcub;(&pgr;&middot;<highlight><italic>deff&middot;&mdash;n</italic></highlight>)/&lgr;&rcub;&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> wherein T&thgr; is a factor, which is a numerical value decided mainly by transmittance of the polarizer used in the liquid crystal panel, &thgr;(E) is the angle made by the effective optical axis of the liquid crystal layer with the polarized light transmission axis, &Dgr;n is liquid crystal refractive anisotropy, and &lgr; is light wavelength. Here, the product of effective thickness deff of the liquid crystal layer and liquid crystal refractive anisotropy &Dgr;n, i.e. deff&middot;&Dgr;n, is called retardation. Crystal layer thickness deff indicates the thickness of only the liquid crystal layer which actually changes its direction of alignment when an electric voltage is applied, and does not express the thickness of the whole liquid crystal layer, because the liquid crystal molecules around the interface of the liquid crystal layer won&apos;t be changed in their direction of alignment, under the influence of interfacial anchorage, even when an electric voltage is applied. Therefore, when the thickness of the whole liquid crystal layer held between a pair of substrates is represented by dLC, there always exists the relation of deff&lt;dLC, and their difference can be estimated to be approximately 20 to 40 nm though variable depending on certain factors such as the material used for the liquid crystal panel and the material forming the interface with the liquid crystal layer, for example, the alignment film material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As is seen from the above equation (1), what is dependent on the strength of electric field is the member sin2&lcub;2&thgr;(E)&rcub; in the above equation, and luminance can be adjusted by varying the angle &thgr; in accordance with the electric field strength. For making a normally closed liquid crystal display device, the polarizers are set such that &thgr; will become 0&deg; (&thgr;&equals;0) when no electric voltage is applied, so that this display system is designed to be sensitive to disturbance in the direction of initial alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the IPS mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices which are sensitively to the disturbance in the direction of initial alignment, the main cause of retardation of darkness of dark display is light leakage that occurs at the periphery of the spacer, because such light leakage causes the liquid crystal molecules in the spacer surface to get aligned contrary to the action of the alignment control film which works to align the liquid crystal molecules in the specified direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The above phenomenon&mdash;that the spacer interface functions like an alignment control film to cause contrary alignment of the liquid crystal molecules&mdash;is not the only case with the IPS mode. However, as mentioned above, the TN mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices are not much affected by light leakage caused by disturbance in the direction of initial alignment. Also, in the TN mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices, means are incorporated for letting the liquid crystal molecules align vertically on the spacer bead surface. This seems to be for the following reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the spacer bead surface, this is an equal value as to whether they are parallel or vertical to the substrate. In the TN mode normally closed liquid crystal displays, an electric field is applied in the direction vertical to the substrates to operate the display system so that the liquid crystal molecules will be aligned parallel to the direction of electric field, so that the disturbance of alignment in the polar direction triggers a fatal increase of light leakage. In other words, since in the TN mode the liquid crystal molecules rise up in the polar direction when the system is operated, such state of rise-up in the polar direction is equal to parallel alignment when viewed from the spacer bead/liquid crystal interface, and is stabilized as is. It is, therefore, almost impossible to control the liquid crystal molecules to take parallel alignment which can prevent them from rising up in the polar direction. So., in the prior art, it has been tried to provide the spacer beads with a vertically aligning function. This is designed to instabilize the rise-up of the liquid crystal molecules in the polar direction where light leakage is most likely to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the case of the IPS mode, however, although rise-up in the polar direction gives no influence on light leakage, disturbance of alignment in the azimuthal direction forces to cause a fatal increase of light leakage. The spacer beads with disposition to vertical alignment tend to cause deviation of alignment in the azimuthal direction, so that when such vertical alignment-oriented spacer beads used in the TN mode liquid crystal displays are applied to the IPS mode liquid crystal displays, there results in an increase of light leakage. It is thus impossible with the conventional techniques to lessen light leakage around the spacer beads in the IPS normally closed liquid crystal displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> This is the problem which is not encountered in the STN mode where the same birefrigent mode is employed, so it is required to contrive a means of solution peculiar to the liquid crystal display devices employing the IPS mode in which an electric field is generated in the transverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have made further researches on the cause of light leakage around the spacer beads and found that the following factors are involved in the matter of light leakage caused by the spacer beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> One factor is that high light leakage around the spacer beads impedes darkness of dark display to worsen the black level. Another factor concerns the facts that the degree of light leakage differs among the spacer beads, and that local concentration of the spacer beads causing high light leakage induces nonuniformity or irregularity of luminance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Therefore, although it is of course a matter of concern to lessen light leakage itself around the spacer beads, it is also an important subject for study to device means for allowing their uniform in-plane distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, in the IPS mode liquid crystal display device, when a pretilt angle between the alignment control film and the liquid crystals becomes higher, there is a problem in that the wide viewing angle of the IPS mode liquid crystal display, which is one of characteristics, is damaged. Particularly when the pretilt angle is more than 4&deg;, the viewing angle properties are rapidly narrowed, so that it is found that particularly the wide viewing angle is preferable when the pretilt angle is made 3&deg; or less (Ohe, et al: Liquid Crystals vol. 22, no. 4, p391, 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display device of high contrast ratio, which is freed of the said problem of light leakage associated with the spacer beads in the IPS mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention envisions to provide a normally closed liquid crystal display device, especially an active-matrix liquid crystal display device employing the in-plane switching mode, and having a pretilt angle between an alignment control film and liquid crystals of 4&deg; or less, characterized in that light leakage centering around each spacer is controlled to be divided into four shapes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> wherein spacer surface is coated with a material which can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (27) A liquid crystal display device described in any one of above (21) to (26), wherein the material which can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light is a material having photo-isomerization reactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (28) A liquid crystal display device described in above (27), wherein the structural segment contributing to the photo-isomerization reaction by polarized light irradiation of the material which can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light is identical with the structural segment contributing to the photo-isomerization reaction by polarized light irradiation of said alignment control film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (29) A liquid crystal display device described in above (27), wherein the wavelength region where the photo-isomerization reaction of said material capable of being provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light and disposed between said liquid crystal layer and said spacers is induced substantially coincides with the wavelength region where the photo-isomerization reaction by polarized light irradiation of said alignment control film is induced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> (30) A liquid crystal display device described in above (27), wherein said alignment control film is made of a material which does not absorb light in the wavelength region where the photo-isomerization reaction of the material capable of being provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light is induced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have studied earnestly and found that by making the contact angle between the spacer and the liquid crystals 60&deg; or less, the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer surface aligned substantially uniform, and the spacer having a four-devided shape can appear predominantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of one layer in the liquid crystal display device. Since the parallel alignment direction of the spacer beads surface and the alignment direction of the alignment control film make an angle of substantially 90&deg; in the region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the liquid crystal molecules are subjected to the liquid crystal molecules are subjected to the greatest stress. Thus, in order to make the region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> stabler, it is preferable to impart wettability against the sight angle direction to the alignment control direction of the alignment control film, that is to impart anisotropy to the contact angle, and to make the contact angle against the alignment control direction small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Particularly, even in a liquid crystal display device wherein a wide viewing angle is provided by making the pretilt angle very low, it is possible to make the 4-divided type very stable by making the contact angle between the liquid crystals and the spacer larger than the contact angle between the alignment control direction of alignment control film and the liquid crystals, and smaller than the contact angle between the liquid crystals and the right-angle direction as to the alignment control direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, when the contact angle between the liquid crystals and the spacer beads is 90&deg; or less, it is possible to make the contact angle smaller by roughening the spacer beads surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The roughening of the spacer beads surfaces is important, and even very fine roughened surfaces produced by introducing surface layers can provide expected effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In order to make the contact angle between the spacer and the liquid crystals 60&deg; or less, one method is to introduce a functional group which becomes a wetting agent for the liquid crystals into the spacer surface. The introduction of such a functional group can be carried out by using a silane coupling agent, or by chemical modification using a surface modifying agent having an acryl group, while applying vinyl groups or hydroxyl groups of the spacer beads by themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> For example, a long-chain alkyl group having one or more multi-valent hydroxyl groups, an alkyl group having a terminal amino group, etc. can be introduced into the spacer beads surfaces via a silane coupling agent, etc. Alternatively, a long-chain alkyl group having one or more multi-valent hydroxyl groups and one or more acryl groups or vinyl groups at another end, an alkyl group having a terminal amino group, etc. can be introduced by chemical modification. When a silane coupling agent is used, the spacer beads can be an inorganic material such as silica. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, it is possible to introduce a functional group into the liquid crystals, said functional group being able to make wetting properties with the spacer surface better. For example, a fluorine group remakably reduces its critical surface tension. To obtain a solid surface tension directly is not established yet. But, when the spacer is made from a polymeric compound which has a surface tension of about 30 mN/m or more, the contact angle can be effectively lowered by making the surface tension of liquid crystals 25 mN/m or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The anisopropy of the contact angle between the alignment control film and the liquid crystals can be imparted by increasing the rubbing strength, taking a rigid molecular structure in the alignment control direction, taking a molecular structure which strengthens intermolecular attaction with the liquid crystals, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As another embodiment for eliminating light leakage associated with the spacer beads, there is offered a liquid crystal display device of a structure comprising a pair of substrates at least one of which is transparent, a liquid crystal layer disposed between said pair of substrates, a group of electrodes for applying to said liquid crystal layer an electric field substantially parallel to the substrate plane and a plural number of active elements connected to said electrodes, said group of electrodes and active elements being formed on one of said pair of substrates, and an alignment control film formed between said liquid crystal layer and at least one of said pair of substrates, wherein spacer beads are provided between said pair of substrates, and a film is disposed between said spacer beads and the liquid crystal layer, said film having been made of a material that can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by irradiation with polarized light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the spacer bead surface is provided with an alignment controlling function by irradiation with poralized light, there takes place no division of alignment such as described above, with consequent elimination of light leakage attributable to the spacer beads themselves. Also, as a result of affording a liquid crystal aligning ability to the spacer bead surface by polarized light irradiation, it becomes possible to control alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the same direction as the alignment film, regardless of the shape of the spacer beads, with no concern on whether the liquid crystal molecules are aligned horizontally or vertically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Further, when a film formed by exposing to polarized light a material capable of being provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by poralized light irradiation is used as said alignment control film, there is eliminated any need of conducting a rubbing treatment, and it is possible to provide an alignment controlling function with a substantially same degree of alignment regulating force as possessed by the alignment control film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the film formed by polarized light irradiation between the spacer and the liquid crystal layer is adapted to constitute a part of the alignment control film, it becomes possible to afford the same alignment regulating force to the alignment control film and to unnecessitate polarized light irradiation for the spacer bead surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Still further, when a transparent organic polymer layer is formed between said alignment control film and at least one of a pair of substrates, and a spacer is disposed between this transparent organic polymer layer and the alignment control film, adhesion between the alignment control film and the substrate is strengthened and also the substrate surface is more flattened, resulting in remarkable improvement of the image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> According to still another embodiment of the present invention, a liquid crystal display device is provided which comprises a pair of substrates at least one of which is transparent, a liquid crystal layer disposed between said pair of substrates, a group of electrodes for applying to said liquid crystal layer an electric field substantially parallel to the substrate plane and a plural number of active elements connected to said electrodes, said group of electrodes and active elements being formed on one of said pair of substrates, and an alignment control film formed between said liquid crystal layer and at least one of said pair of substrates, wherein a spacer is provided between said pair of substrates, and a film obtained by chemically treating a material that can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by polarized light irradiation is disposed between said spacer and liquid crystal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable to coat the spacer surface with a material that can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by polarized light irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The material that can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability by polarized light irradiation and is used for the said purpose in this invention is preferably the one having photo-isomerization reactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> When the structural section contributing to photo-isomerization reaction by polarized light irradiation of the specified material is equalized to the structural section contributing to similar photo-isomerization reaction of the alignment control film, the alignment treatments can be accomplished simultaneously using the same light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Also, when the long wavelength region which causes the photo-isomerization reaction of the specified material formed between the spacer and the liquid crystal layer is arranged to substantially coincide with the long wavelength region which induces the photo-isomerization reaction of the alignment control film by polarized light irradiation, it becomes possible to perform the alignment treatments in the same direction simultaneously using the same light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Conversely, when the alignment control film is made of a material which is incapable of inducing photo-isomerization reaction with light in the long wavelength region causing photo-isomerization reaction of the specified material or which is incapable of absorbing light in said long wavelength region, it becomes possible to freely conduct the alignment treatment of the spacer bead surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, as explained above, since a liquid crystal aligning ability is afforded to the spacer bead surface by polarized light irradiation, control of alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the same direction as the alignment film, not alignment in either horizontal or vertical direction, is enabled regardless of the shape of the spacer beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to lessen light leakage due to disturbance of initial alignment of the liquid crystal layer around the spacer bead surface and to provide a high-contrast liquid crystal display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As described above, in an in-plane switching mode liquid crystal display device, the light leakage amount can be reduced by making the light leakage taking a 4-devided shapes by placing the spacer heads in the center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further illustrated by the following embodiments. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic sectional view of a panel in a liquid crystal display device according to the present invention. It will be seen that a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprising a composition of plural compounds is disposed between a pair of transparent substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the liquid crystal molecules are schematically shown as rod-like bodies <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Polarizers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; are disposed on the outside of said pair of substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. Strip electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are provided on the surface of one of the substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the inside of the cell, and an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is overlaid thereon. Electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a common electrode which supplies an electric voltage of a fixed waveform independently of the picture signal, and electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a pixel electrode providing a voltage whose wavelength varies according to the picture signal. An image signal electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided at the same altitude as the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. There are provided two insulating layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> each of which is made of silicon nitride. On the opposite substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided a color filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for making color display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A 3% solution of polyamic acid, which is precursor of the alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is applied to the substrate and calcined at 200&deg; C. for 30 minutes for imidization. Specifically, polyamic acid is prepared using 1,2,3,4-cyclopentenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 1,2,4,5-cyclohexanetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 3,3&prime;,4,4&prime;-biscyclohexanetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, 3,3&prime;,4,4&prime;-benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride or the like as acid anhydride and 4,4&prime;-diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 3,3&prime;-diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 3,3&prime;-diaminodiphenyl sulfone or the like as diamine, and its solution is applied to the substrate, dried and calcined to form an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, followed by rubbing thereof for aligning the liquid crystal molecules. The long axis direction of the liquid crystal molecules in the produced state of alignment, i.e. the initial alignment direction <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is adjusted so that the angle &phgr;LC defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> becomes 75&deg;. The acid anhydrides and diamine compounds such as mentioned above can be used either singly or by mixing two or more of them as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Then the polymeric spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a particle size of 4 &mgr;m are dispersed on the substrates by dry scatter method. &ldquo;Dry scatter method&rdquo; is a method in which a negative pressure is generated at the nozzle section by discharging an inert gas from a compressed gas supply pipe to suck up and scatter the spacer beads from a spacer beads supply pipe. No solvent is used as a dispersing medium for the spacer beads. The spacer beads are made of divinylbenzene and have a C<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>alkyl group and a hydroxyl group introduced to the surfaces with the aid of a silane coupling agent. Each bead is coated with an alignment control film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which functions to have the liquid crystal molecules aligned in the parallel direction. Then the upper and lower substrates are placed in position and the peripheral parts are sealed to constitute an empty cell-like structure. A schematic sectional illustration of this liquid crystal display device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The reference numerals used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> correspond to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Nematic liquid crystal with positive dielectric anisotropy is used as the liquid crystal composition. Dielectric anisotropy &Dgr;&egr; of the liquid crystal is 10.2 and its refractive anisotropy &Dgr;n is 0.073. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D illustrate the switching behavior of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal panel obtained in the manner described above. In this Example, the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are aligned to have the angle &phgr;LC of 75&deg; against the direction vertical to the longitudinal direction of the strip electrodes when no electric field is applied. In case dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal is positive, alignment would be made to satisfy the condition of 45&deg;&lE;&verbar;&phgr;LC&verbar;&lt;90&deg;. In the case of the liquid crystal composition illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D, dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal may be negative. In this case, it is recommended to initially align the liquid crystal molecules to the angle of 0&deg;&lE;&verbar;&phgr;LC&verbar;&lt;45&deg; from the direction vertical to the strip electrodes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D, the direction of alignment is indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When an electric field <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is applied across the electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, alignment of the liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is shifted so that their long axis direction will become parallel to the direction of electric field <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5D</cross-reference>. As a result of this operation, &thgr; in the formula (1) varies in accordance with electric field strength E, causing a corresponding variation of transmittance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the instant embodiment of the present invention, the liquid crystal is sandwiched between a pair of polarizers arranged normal to each other since a birefrigent mode display system is employed. Further, in order to provide the characteristics of the normally closed system which gives dark display at low voltage, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, &phgr;P&equals;&phgr;LC&equals;75&deg;, was made, i.e. the polarized light transmission axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of one of the polarizers is paralleled to the direction of initial alignment while the polaraized light transmission axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; of the other polarizer is set perpendicular to the initial alignment. The observed transmitted light strength is determined by the formula (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C illustrate the layout of a group of electrodes comprising common electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, picture signal electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and scanning electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thin-film transistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a unitary pixel section in the instant embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is a frontal view taken from the direction vertical to the panel surface, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</cross-reference> are lateral sectional views. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the circuit system in the liquid crystal display device in the instant embodiment of the present invention. The circuit system comprises vertical scanning signal circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, picture signal circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, common electrode driving circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, power circuit and controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but the circuit arrangement available in the present invention is not limited to the shown system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> One example of constitution of the optical system in the liquid crystal display device formed as mentioned above is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. It will be seen that a back light unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprising a power source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a light cover <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a photoconductor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a diffuser <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided on the backside of a liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A prism sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for increasing luminance at the normal angle is shown in the drawing, but there is no problem when no prism sheet is used. A fragmentary perspective view of such a liquid crystal display device, for example, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In this case, the surface tension of the liquid crystal material is 28 mN/m, and the contact angle between the liquid crystal and the spacer beads is 48.6&deg;. Since the contact angle between the liquid crystal and the alignment direction of the alignment film is 10&deg;, a 4-division type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be obtained, wherein light leakage due to the spacer beads is shown almost over the whole bead surface. The volume of light leakage per piece of spacer bead is 8.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> denotes a photoconductor, numeral <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> denotes a diffuser, numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> denotes a light source, numeral <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> denotes a liquid crystal panel, numeral <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> denotes a shield case, numeral <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> denotes an aperture, numeral <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> denotes a reflector, numeral <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> denotes an invertor circuit, and numeral <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> denotes a lower case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The light leakage can be measured as follows. First a luminance of dark display in a region containing no spacer heads in a liquid crystal panel is measured. Then, a luminance in a region containing spacer beads and having the same area as the region previously measured is measured. Next, the difference between both luminances measured is divided by the density of spacer beads and the resulting value is defined as a light leakage per spacer bead. By measuring as mentioned above, the light leakage can be measured quantitatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> A transmittance used herein can be defined as a transmittance in a display picture element (pixel) region. That is, a transmittance (luminance) in a practical liquid crystal display is results of aperture ratio of a color filer and a display region, and influences of light leakage caused by factors other than the spacer beads, for example, edge portions of picture element, etc. Therefore, these influences are removed and the transmittance is shown in a state wherein only the influence of spacer is quantitatively evaluated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a relationship between a spacer dispersing density and a light leakage of the spacer of this Example, and influences of spacers of Comparative Examples mentioned below on lowering in contrast ratio. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the lowering of the contrast ratio can be inhibited remarkably. The maximum value of the spacer dispersing density is 500 pieces/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The dispersing density necessary for maintaining the thickness of liquid crystal layer at constant depends on the margin of production process of a liquid crystal display device but is not preferable practically above 500 pieces/mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>due to bad influences on the picture quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it is possible to estimate an allowable value against the light leakage of spacer. That is, when the light leakage is above 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>(%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece), the contrast ratio is reduced to a half by only the influence of a spacer. Since there are many factors for lowering the contrast ratio other than the spacer, it is not preferable to further lower the contrast ratio only by the influence of light leakage of spacer. Therefore, in order to realize an in-plane switching mode liquid crystal display device having a good picture quality, which is an object of the present invention, it is necessary to make the light leakage of spacer 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>(%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece) or lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> When the above layout is applied to a prototype model of IPS mode TFT liquid crystal display device having a diagonal of 13.3 inches, a pixel count of 1,024&times;RGB&times;768 and a spacer bead dispersion density of about 120 pieces/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the black display with very good level is shown. This device has a high contrast ratio of 300. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Contrast ratio can be determined by measuring transmittance (luminance) of bright display, or luminance and transmittance (luminance) of dark display, and dividing the measured value of the former by the measured value of the latter. Transmittance can be determined by a photomultiplier with brightness of the light source being supposed to be 100. Luminance can be determined by measuring brightness of the display device by a luminance meter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Equimolar amounts of diethoxy-3-glycidoxypropylmethylsilane and dihydroxypentylamine are mixed, stirred and evaporated, and the resulting compound is dissolved in ethanol. The polymeric spacer beads having a particle size of 4.0 &mgr;m are immersed in this solution, stirred at 50&deg; C. for 2 hours, filtered, washed with ethanol and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> As the monomer component of the alignment film, a 1:4 mixture (in molar ratio) of 4-octadecyloxy-1,3-diaminocyclohexane and p-phenylenediamine is used as diamine moiety and an equimolar mixture of 1,2,3,4-butanetetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and 1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride is used as acid anhydride to prepare polyamic acid. This solution is coated on the substrates, dried and calcined to form an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the film is rubbed for aligning the liquid crystal molecules. The rubbing density is adjusted to provide a pretilt angle of 10. These acid anhydrides and diamine compounds may not be used singly; they may be used by mixing two or more of them as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> An IPS mode TFT liquid crystal display device with a diagonal of 13.3 inches, a pixel count of 1,024&times;RGB&times;768 and an average spacer bead dispersion density of 100 pieces/mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is made in the same way as in Example 1. In the device of this embodiment, the liquid crystal/spacer bead contact angle is 8&deg; , the contact angle between the liquid crystal and the alignment film in its aligning direction is 6&deg; and the contact angle in the direction orthogonal to the aligning direction is 9.8&deg;. In the liquid display of this construction, the spacer beads of the 4-division type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a light leakage contribution of 7.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>(%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece) appeare almost over the whole surface. Thereby a liquid crystal display device showing a very good dark level with a contrast ratio of 310 can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The liquid display device of the instant embodiment has a particularly wide viewing angle because of very small pretilt angle. In case the pretilt angle is small as in the instant embodiment, the liquid crystal molecules in the region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> must be aligned vertically to the spacer fairly strictly. This is for the reason that if the liquid crystal molecules are aligned horizontally to the azimuthal direction, no 4-division type alignment is provided nor can be effected molecular alignment horizontal to the polar direction. In this case, if the contact angle with the alignment control film in its alignment controlling direction is smaller than the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle, it is possible to afford an easy-to-wet property to the molecules in the alignment controlling direction, and if the contact angle in the direction orthogonal to the alignment controlling direction is smaller than the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle, the liquid crystal molecules become hard to wet in this direction, i.e. they become easy to control in the alignment controlling direction. This has the effect of realizing preferential emergence of the 4-division type even in case the pretilt angle is low and the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is small. Particularly when the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is smaller than 10&deg;, the horizontal aligning tendency becomes very strong, so that it is desirable to make use of the above effect of the instant embodiment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 8 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> 10 g of polymeric spacer beads having a particle size of 4.0 &mgr;m are immersed in 100 g of a THF solution containing equimolar amounts of 3-aminopropyldiethoxymethylsilane, 7-hydroxyoctylcarbonyl chloride and triethylamine, and the solution is stirred at 50&deg; C. for 2 hours, then filtered, washed with THF and dried. Then glass fibers of 4 &mgr;m in diameter are mixed in a ratio of 20%, and the mixture is dispersed in a 1:1 mixed solvent of 2-propanol and water by an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 minutes and then centrifuged to separate the spacer beads. This treatment produce a small cavity on the spacer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As the monomer component of the alignment film, p-phenylenediamine is used as diamine moiety and pyromellitic acid dianhydride is used as acid anhydride moiety to prepare polyamic acid, and this solution is coated on the substrates, dried and calcined to form an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which is then rubbed for aligning the liquid crystal molecules. The rubbing density is adjusted to provide a pretilt angle of 3.3&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> An IPS mode TFT liquid crystal display device with a diagonal of 13.3 inches, a pixel count of 1.024&times;RGB&times;768 and an average spacer bead dispersion density of 120 pieces/mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is made in the same way as in Example 3. In this Example, the liquid crystal/spacer bead contact angle is 20&deg; and the contact angle with the alignment film in its aligning direction is 6.7&deg;. In the thus composed liquid crystal display device, the spacer beads of the 4-division type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a light leakage contribution of 7.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>(%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece) emerge almost over the whole surface. Thereby a liquid crystal display device showing very good dark level and a contrast of 305 can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> If the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is 90&deg; or less, the liquid crystal can fill up the cavity on the spacer bead surface, so that a smooth surface is provided in which a certain portion is the solid of the space bead surface and another portion is composed of the liquid crystal. Since the liquid crystal/liquid crystal contact angle is 0&deg;, the apparent contact angle decreases. This accounts for the effect of reducing the contact angle from 41&deg; to 20&deg; in the instant embodiment. Therefore, when the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is 70&deg; to 90&deg;, the spacer beads composed of a high-molecular weight compound may be used by mixing therewith the ceramic particles, glass fibers or the like, stirring the mixture and separating the beads. It is to be noted that when the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle exceeds 90&deg;, the liquid crystal is incapable of filling up the cavity on the spacer surface, so that a certain portion becomes the solid of the spacer bead surface while another portion is turned into air, resulting in an increase of apparent contact angle. Therefore, the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle exceeding 90&deg; is impracticable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 9 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In order to investigate the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle and the liquid crystal/alignment control film contact angle, a model experiment is carried out using the unit cells. The unit cells are constructed by washing the glass substrates, coating the substrates with the polyimide-based alignment films produced by Nissan Chemical Co., Ltd., Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd., Chisso Corp., etc., changing wettability of the alignment control film in its alignment controlling direction and in the direction orthogonal thereto, scattering the spacers on the film-coated substrates and sealing the peripheral portions to make the empty cells. After the sealant is cured, the liquid crystal is encapsulated and the deflectors are set in position to construct the unit cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> As the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal compositions produced by Merck &amp; Co., Ltd., Chisso Corp. and Lodic Co., Ltd. were used. As the spacers, those employed in Examples 1 to 8 and the commercial products available from Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd., Kao Corp. and Natoco Paint Co., Ltd. were used. Light leakage is determined by a method in which the contact angles are measured in the manner described above and a combination of the unit cells that provides the desired contact angles are assembled. In the IPS mode normally closed liquid crystal display devices, light leakage can be determined at the dark level where no electric field is applied, so that the amount of light leakage determined by this method is equal to the value obtained from the measurement on a full-fledged IPS mode liquid crystal display device. Therefore, the contrast ratio of the IPS mode liquid crystal display devices can be predicted from this method. Since this method is designed for the model experiments, it is possible to carry out an experiment using model liquid crystal for close investigation of the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> In this way, various types of unit cells are manufactured and investigated. As a result, it is found that when the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is made smaller than 60&deg;, the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer surface substantially assume parallel alignment and it is possible to let the 4-division type spacers emerge preferentially. On the other hand, when the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle exceeds 800, the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer surface assume vertical alignment regardless of anchoring of the alignment control film and other conditions, and consequently, as noted in Comparative Example 2, light leakage centering around each spacer is increased. When the said contact angle is within the range of 60&deg; to 80&deg;, the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer surface can take either horizontal or vertical alignment depending on the other factors such as anchoring and pretilt angle of the alignment control film. In this case, the latter of the above-mentioned two phenomena relating to the spacers, viz. degradation of image quality due to the presence of the spacers with large and small light leakage, is called in question. It is also a matter of concern that alignment around the spacer is unstable and subject to change with time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to provide parallel alignment of the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer surface, it is necessary to make the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle not greater than 60&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The results of the instant embodiment are shown in Table 1. In this way, there were acquired means for obtaining the objective high-image-quality IPS mode liquid crystal displays.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The following facts are clarified from the above results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The neutral liquid crystal having no polar group has a stronger inclination to assume vertical alignment. This is considered attributable to the wetting agent-like action of the functional group having polarity on the spacer surface. Also, by introducing a functional group such as alkyl group or hydroxyl group to the spacer surface as in Run Nos. 3 and 4, it is possible to improve wettability and to obtain a positive effect in reducing light leakage due to the spacers. This owes to the fact that the functional group on the spacer surface has the function of a wetting agent. It can thus be learned that it is effective to introduce to the liquid crystal or spacer surface a functional group acting like a wetting agent which betters wettability of both the liquid crystal and the spacer surface. These effects are attributable to the difference between them in intermolecular attraction and individual cohesive force, so that the desired result can be obtained by offering a combination that strengthens intermolecular attraction. These features are not limited to the compounds in the instant embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The pretilt angle of Run No. 6 is almost 00. It is noted that if the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is reduced excessively to induce a strong tendency to assume horizontal alignment and also the liquid crystal/alignment control film contact angle is reduced radically, the liquid crystal molecules in the region indicated by numeral <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are stabilized in their horizontal alignment on the spacer surface and consequently the 2-division type prevails. It is thus seen that it is important to control the value of liquid crystal/alignment control film contact angle, especially in case the liquid crystal/spacer contact angle is extremely small. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In this liquid crystal display device, common electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adapted to apply a voltage of a fixed waveform independently of the picture signal and scanning wiring electrodes are provided on the lower one (numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of a pair of substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. Overlaid on these electrodes is an insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; made of silicon nitride, and on this insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are provided pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are varied in waveform according to the picture signal and signal distributor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which issues picture signal to the pixel electrodes. Overlaid on these electrodes are another insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> made of silicon nitride and a transparent organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in this order. On said organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are provided an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, said alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being partly disposed between each spacer bead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also, this alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is made of a material which can be provided with a liquid crystal aligning function by irradiation with polarized light. A polarizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is provided on the underside of the substrate On the lower side of the other substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided a color filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for making color display, and an organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; and an alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&prime; are laid underneath said color filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A polarizer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided on the upper side of this substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In this figure, the angles made by the polarizers with the direction of electric field <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are indicated by &phgr;p1 and &phgr;p2 and the angle made by the alignment direction with the direction of electric field is indicated by &phgr;LC. In this Example, the above angles are set to be &phgr;LC&equals;75&deg;, &phgr;p1&equals;300 and &phgr;p<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;120&deg;. That is, the angular setting is made to provide the normally open display characteristics. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> indicates the alignment direction, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> the polarized light transmission axis of one of the polarizers, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; the polarized light transmission axis of another polarizer which crosses the transmission axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at right angles, and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a strip electrode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> No alignment control film is shown in this figure, but since a liquid crystal aligning force is provided between each spacer bead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the liquid crystal layer by polarized light irradiation, the liquid crystal layer around each spacer bead won&apos;t be disturbed in its alignment and the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the same direction as the aligning direction of the alignment control film. This greatly contributes to the reduction of light leakage around the spacer beads and the consequent improvement of contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> A process for producing this liquid crystal display device is shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The procedure till formation of the pixel electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, common electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is the same as in the conventional process for producing an IPS mode liquid crystal display device, but the process of the present invention is different in that a transparent organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are produced in the following way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed by applying on the insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> a polyamic acid solution of PIQ-1800 (an amorphous film produced by Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd.) diluted to a 8.5% concentration, and heating it at 150% for 10 minutes to evaporate the solvent. This organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided for securing adhesion of the alignment control film to the insulating film or the electrodes, but it may not be provided when secure adhesion can be provided by merely imidizing the alignment control film. Provision of said film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also proves useful for flattening the assembly structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided after forming the organic polymer film by dispersing the polymeric spacer beads of 4 &mgr;m in particle size on the substrate by the dry scatter method. The &ldquo;dry scatter method&rdquo; used in the present invention is a method in which a negative pressure is produced in the nozzle section by discharging an inert gas from a compressed gas supply pipe to suck up and scatter the spacer beads for liquid crystal display devices from a spacer bead supply pipe. In this method, no solvent is used as spacer beads dispersing medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed after dispersion of the spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by applying a 3% solution of polyamic acid, and calcining the coating at 200&deg; C. for 30 minutes for imidization. The precursor of the alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is polyamic acid which is a polyimide precursor. Polymeric acid is synthesized using an equimolar mixture of 4,4&prime;-diaminoazobenzene containing diazobenzene groups and 4,4&prime;-diaminophenylmethane as diamine moiety and pyromellitic acid dianhydride and 1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride as acid anhydrides. In the instant embodiment of the present invention, azobenzene groups such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,941, which is herein fully incorporated by reference, are introduced into the composition to afford photo-isomerization reactivity, but other groups, preferably stilbene group or the like, may be applied if they have photo-isomerization reactivity and an ability to control liquid crystal alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> After formation of said polyimde precursor film (organic polymer layer), dispersion of the spacer beads and formation of another polyimide precursor film (alignment control layer) have been completed, imidization was effected by calcination. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The spacer beads treated as described above are dispersed on the substrate by the half-dry scatter method. &ldquo;Half-dry scatter method&rdquo; is a method in which the spacer beads are dispersed in an alcohol or a water/alcohol mixed solvent and scattered in the form of a mist with a jet of an inert gas. In this operation, since the inside of the disperser from the nozzle through the distance to the substrate is heated, the solvent is evaporated before reaching the substrate, allowing the spacer beads alone to deposit on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In this Example, imidization by calcination and dispersion of the spacer beads are conducted after formation of a polyimide precursor film constituting a transparent organic polymer layer and a polyimdie precursor film constituting an alignment control film. Then the upper and lower substrates are placed in position and the peripheral part is closed by a sealant to constitute an empty cell-like structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Then the cell is irradiated externally with polarized light from a high-pressure mercury lamp through a polarizing film. Thereby the modified film on the spacer bead surface is provided with a liquid crystal aligning ability and the liquid crystal molecules on the spacer bead surface are aligned in the same direction as the rubbing direction. Light leakage contribution of the cell is 0.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>(%&middot;mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> With the above construction, a prototype of IPS mode TFT liquid crystal display device with a diagonal of 13.3 inches and a pixel count of 1,024&times;RGB&times;768 is manufactured in the same way as in Example 10. Light leakage due to the spacer beads in dark display markedly reduces, and this prototype also shows excellent black level and good uniformity of display with a contrast ratio of 320. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 17 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In this Example, the polymeric spacer beads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a particle size of 4 &mgr;m are dispersed on the substrate by the dry scatter method without forming an organic polymer film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Then a 3% solution of polyamic acid (precursor of the alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is applied, followed by 30-minute calcination at 200&deg; C. for imidization. The precursor of the alignment control film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is polyamic acid which is a polyimide precursor, and it is synthesized using an equimolar mixture of 4,4&prime;-diaminobenzene containing diazobenzene groups and 4,4&prime;-diaminophenylmethane as diamine compounds and pyromellitic acid dianhydride and 1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride as acid anhydrides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In this Example, imidization by calcination is conducted after dispersion of the spacer beads and formation of a polyimide precursor film constituting an alignment control layer, and a trial model of liquid crystal display device is manufactured in the same way as in Example 10. Light leakage contribution is 1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 (%&middot;mm</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/piece). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> With the above construction, a prototype of IPS mode TFT liquid crystal display device with a diagonal of 13.3 inches and a pixel count of 1,024&times;RGB&times;768 is manufactured. Light leakage due to the spacer beads in dark display reduces remarkably, and this prototype also shows excellent black level and a contrast ratio of 300. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as described above, a high-contrast normally closed type in-plane switching mode liquid crystal display device which is operated by applying to the liquid crystal layer an electric field in the direction substantially parallel to the substrates is realized. </paragraph>
