<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A magnesium alloy having excellent castability and creep properties has compositions of 1.0-6.0 wt % Zn, 0.5-3.0 wt % Ca, 1.0 wt % or less Zr, 1.0-5.0 wt % at least one lanthanoid, the remainder being Mg and unavoidable impurities. This magnesium alloy undergoes heat treatment of heating the magnesium alloy to 430-470 &deg; C., quenching, and then heating to 150-250 &deg; C. for aging.

<heading lvl="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a magnesium (Mg) alloy habing excellent castability for die casting and creep characteristics, which contains Zn, Ca, Zr and at least one rare earth element in predetermined ratios, as the essential components, and a heat treatment method for further improving mechanical properties (particularly hardness, creep strength and fatigue strength) of a magnesium alloy. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, needs for a light-weight material are increasing. In paticular, a magnesium alloy, the smallest density of practical alloys is noted as materials for aircrafts and automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, due to poor high-temperature strength of this magnesium alloy or in order to increase heat resistance thereof, expensive elements such as yttrium (Y) or silver (Ag) are added thereto. As a result, such an alloy becomes a very expensive alloy and also hot teating is liable to occur where it is used for high pressure die casting. Thus, the magnesium alloy is used only for very limited purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> So, various magnesium alloys are proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems. For examples, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei (hereinafter referred to as JP-A-) 7-18364 descloses a Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca alloy haing improed heat resistance and creep characteristics by adding relatively inexpensive calcium (Ca) in place of expensive elements such as yttrium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, in the similar alloy system, JP-A-6-25791 discloses a Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca&mdash;Cu alloy having improved room-temperature strength and high temperature strength by adding copper (Cu) in addition to calcium. For example, the above-mentioned JP-A-6-25791 discloses a magnesium alloy having excellent room-tempera ture and high temperature strength, which comprises 3-8 wt % of zinc, 0.8-5 wt % of calcium, and 0-10 wt % of copper, and if necessary, further comprising 2 wt % or less of each of manganese, zirconium and silicon, and 4 wt % or less of at least one of rare earth element, the remainder being magnesium and unavoidable impurities. The unit of wt % hereinafter means % by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as a magnesium alloy having excellent room-temperature and high temperature strength, JP-A-6-200348 discloses a magnesium alloy comprising (a) 0.5-5 wt % of lanthanoids, (b) 0.5-5 wt % of calcium, (c) 1.5 wt % or less of manganese and/or 1.5 wt % or less of zirconium, (d) if required, at least one member selected from the group consisting of 1-9.5 wt % of aluminum, 1-7.5 wt % of zinc and 0.5-4 wt % of silver, (e) if further required, at least one element selected from the group consisting of 5.5 wt % or less of yttrium, 1.5 wt % or less of strontium and 10 wt % or less of scandium, the remainder being magnesium and unavoidable impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, the addition of Ca decreases elongation of a magnesium alloy. Therefore, the alloys were subjected to solution heat treatment in JP-A-6-25791 and 6-200348. Further, general Mg&mdash;Zn based aloys such as ZE41 increase its strength only by artificially aging at relatively low temperature (T5 treatment). This is due to that this kind of alloy compound can be formed at relatively low temperature. On the other hand, usual Mg-R.E. based alloys such as EZ33 undergo T5 treatment because it is difficult to complete a solution heat treatment to them conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, sufficient high temperature strength cannot be imparted to general magnesium alloys which do not contain Ca, such as Ze41 or EZ33. On the other hand, heat treatment to the magnesium alloys was not sufficiently investigated in JP-A-6-25791 and 6-200348, and failed making such alloys sufficiently exhibit their characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> And, those alloys have the disadvantages that hot tearing tends to occur in die casting, and therefore it is difficult to conduct die casting. Further, creep properties of those alloys are good as compared with other magnesium alloys, but are poor as compared with the conventional alloys having added thereto expensive elements such as yttrium. Therefore, a magnesium alloy which is cheap and excellent both in castability for die casting and high temperature creep properties have not been known yet. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a result of extensive investigations and various systematic experiments to overcome the above-mentioned problems involved in the related arts, the present inventors have reached the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present inention is to provide a magnesium alloy having excellent castability for high pressure die casting and high temperature creep properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a heat treatment method of a magnesium alloy by applying a casting method other than a high pressure die casting for further improving mechanical properties, such as hardness, creep strength and fatigue strength, of the conventional Mg&mdash;Ca based alloys such as a Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca based allys or Mg-R.E. (lanthanoids)-Ca based alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magnesium alloy having excellent high pressure die casting properties and creep properties, comprising: calcium(Ca) in the content range of 0.5 to 3.0 wt %; zinc(Zn) in the content range of 1.0 to 6.0 wt %; zirconium(Zr) in the content range of 1.0 wt % or less (exclusive of 0 wt %); at least one rare earth element in the content range of 1.5 to 2.7 wt %; the remainder being magnesium; and unavoidable impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magnesium alloy having excellent high pressure die casting properties and creep characteristics, comprising: Calcium(Ca) in the content range of 0.5 to 3.0 wt %; zinc(Zn) in the content range of 1.0 to 6.0 wt %; zirconium(Zr) in the content range of 1.0 wt % or less; at least one rare earth element in the content range of 1.5 to 2.7 wt %; alminum (Al) in the content of 2.0% or less (exclusive of 0 wt %); manganese (Mn) in the content of 1.0 wt % or less; the remainder being magnesium; and unavoidable impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present inventiion, there is provided a heat treatment method of a magnesium alloy, comprising: calcium(Ca) in the content range of 0.5 to 3.0 wt %; zinc(Zn) in the content range of 1.0 to 6.0 wt %; zirconium(Zr) in the content range of 1.0 wt % or less (exclusive of 0 wt %); at least one rare earth element in the content range of 1.5 to 5.0 wt %; the remainder being magnesium; and unavoidable impurities, comprising the steps of: a) heating the magnesium alloy in the temperature range of 430 to 470&deg; C.; b) quenching the heated aloloy; and c) heating the alloy to in the temperature range of 150 to 250&deg; C. to age the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have noted the folowing points for the above-mentioned problems in the related arts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Almost all of magnesium products are high pressure die casting product. However, the above-mentioned Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca alloys in the related arts are liable to cause hot tear, and it is difficult to apply the alloys to high pressure die csting. Therefore, the present inventors have intended to improve castability of these alloys and to increase high temperature characteristics of these alloys as high as those of an aluminum alloy and the conventional magnesium alloys which have expensive elements such as yttrium as an additive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As a result of various investigations to solve the above problem, the present inventors have found that casting crack can be suppressed if an element which causes eutectic reaction with Mg and an element which has an effect for finely dividing Mg particles and causes peritectic reaction with Mg are added in combination, to the Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca alloy. Through further investigations on these additives, the inventors have come to know that rare earth elements which have a relatively low solubility (Lanthanoids) to Mg, e.g. lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr) neodymium (Nd) and misch metal, a mixture of those elements are effective in eutectic reaction. They also discovered that zirconium (Zr) is very effective in causing peritectic reaction, which finely divides and spheroidize crystal particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Mechanism that the magnesium alloy of the present invention has excellent castability and creep characteristics together is not yet clarified, but it is considered as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The magnesium alloy of the present invention improves formability of hot tear and high temperature strength of the conventional Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca alloy. The decrease of formability of hot tear is considered to be due to that an appropriate increase of eutectic compound, narrowed solidification temperature, and finely dividing a &mdash;Mg particles are acted cooperatively. The increase of machaical properties is speculated to be caused by fine a &mdash;Mg particles solid solution hardening and precipitation hardening.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Zn in the magnesium alloy of the present invention improves room temperature strength and castability of the alloy. If the Zn content is less than 1% by weight with respect to a total alloy weight which is hereinafter refered to as % by weight or wt %, the effect thereof is insufficient, and hot tear is liable to occur. On the other hand, if the Zn content exceeds 6% by weight, creep properties are deteriorated. Therefore, the amount of Zn to be added is 1.0 to 6.0% by weight, and preferably 2 to 4% by weight so that the room temperature strength is improved, and creep properties do not substantially deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Ca improves static strength of Mg and creep properties of the alloy. If the Ca content is less than 0.5% by weight, the alloy cannot sufficiently reinforced. On the other hand, if the Ca content exceeds 3.0% by weight, elongation is decreased and also many hot tearing occur in high pressure die casting. Therefore, the amount of Ca to be added is 0.5 to 3.0% by weight. Since improvement of creep characteristics due to addition of Ca almost saturates in an amount of about 1.0% by weight, the amount of Ca added is preferably 0.7 to 1.5% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Zirconium must be added in an amount of more than 0% by weight so as to exhibit the finely dividing effect. The Zr content is preferably 0.4% by weight or more, and more preferably 0.5% by weight or more. However, if the Zr content exceeds 1% by weight, a melting poingt of the alloy becomes higher, so that zirconium does not disperse uniformly, which is industrially unfavorable. Therefore, the Zr content is generally 1.0% or less by weight, preferably 0.4 to 1.0% by weight, and more preferably 0.5 to 1.0% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The rare earth element that forms an eutectic compound improves the high pressure die casting properties of the alloy and also increases strength thereof. In particular, it is effective to use at least one of rare earth elements having a relatively low solubility (lanthanoids) in magnesium and showing a eutectic type constitutional diagram at magnesium side, such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium or neodymium. If the total content of the rare earth element is less than 1.5% by weight, an effect for suppressing hot tear is small, and on the other hand, if the total content thereof exceeds 5% by weight, the alloy becomes brittle due to increase of the eutectic compound. Therefore, the rare earth element content is 1.5 to 5% by weight, and preferably 2.0 to 2.7% by weight for sufficiently exhibiting characteristics of the rare earth element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The magnesium alloy of the present invention may contain aluminum in an amount of 2.0% by weight or less in order to improve a static strength. Incidentally, if the proportion of aluminum exceeds 2.0% by weight, creep properties may deteriorate. The magnesium alloy of the present invention may also contain manganese in an amount of 1.0% by weight or less for the purpose of improving corrosion resistance and creep characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> One example of a process for producing the magnesium alloy of the present invention is briefly explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> That is, the alloy of the present invention is produced by adding each component element other than magnesium to molten magnesium in the form of pure metal, alloy, chloride or fluoride, or by combining various mother alloys containing magnesium or each component element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that regarding zirconium, it is necessary to stir a melt, considering sustained time of a finely dividing effect. During melting work, as well as conventional magnesium, it is preferred to conduct, if required and necessary, anti-combustion or refining with SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, flux or the like. By die casting this melt, a material having a fine structure and good mechanical characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The magnesium alloy of the present invention (hereinafter simply referred to as &ldquo;the alloy&rdquo;) is investigated in detail on structure change to temperature. As a result, it has been found that re-melting temperature of the alloy is about 60&deg; C. higher than that of the conventional Mg&mdash;Zn&mdash;Ca based alloy. Therefore, utilizing this fact, invenstigations have been made, regarding a material which can be heat-treated such as a gravity casting material, to further increase strength of the material by heat treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In order to improve high temperature creep strength, it is advantageous to precipitate a compound after dissolving many solutes in a matrix. Therefore, the alloy is subjected to a solution heat treatment. The temperature of the solution heat treatment is 430&deg; C. or more to 470&deg; C. or less. If the temperature is less than 430&deg; C., almost all of compounds maintain its form, and a solubility of element in the matrix does not almost change. On the other hand, if the temperature exceeds 470&deg; C., a low temperature melting portion re-melts, and defects are formed. Therefore, the solution heat treatment temperature must be 430 to 470&deg; C. Further, in order to sufficiently dissolve the compounds in the matrix, 5 hours or more are necessary, and the solubility substantially reaches the dissolution limit in 24 hours. Therefore, it is sufficient for the solution heat treatment time to be 5 to 24 hours. After this treatment, the alloy is quenched in an appropriate medium (such as hot water or forced air cooling) so as not to produce coarse compounds in the course of cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The alloy thus subjected to the solution heat treatment is aged by heating it to 150 to 250&deg; C. (compounds are precipitated, thereby hardening the alloy). If the aging temperature is less than 150&deg; C., it takes long time for hardening. On the other hand, if the aging temperature exceeds 250&deg; C., precipitation hardening does not occur remarkably. Therefore, the aging temperature is 150 to 250&deg; C., and preferably 150 to 200&deg; C. An aging time varies depending on the temperature, but it sufficiently hardens for 0.5 to 24 hours. The aging conditions are preferably 180 to 200&deg; C. and 0.5 to 2 hours, in view of temperature control and productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the alloy, Ca finely divides precipitates to improve heat resistance of the alloy. In other words, Ca suppresses growth rate of precipitates. This effect is further remarkable by adding Ca in an amount of 0.5% by weight or more. The effect by addition of Ca saturates at the maximum solubility of Ca. Therefore, even if Ca may be added in an amount of about 1% by weight or more, there is no great change. Further, toughness of the alloy decreases as the amount of Ca added increases. Therefore, addition of Ca in an amount exceeding 3.0% by weight is not preferable. Therefore, Ca is added in an amount of 0.5 to 3.0% by weight. Considering toughness of the alloy to be obained, it is preferable to add Ca in an amount of 0.5 to 1% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the alloy, Zn is related to solubility strengthening, precipitation strenghthening and castability. In order to strengthen the alloy with Zn, it is neessary to add Zn in an amount of 1% by weight or more. However, if Zn is added in an amount exceeding 6% by weight, a large amount of compounds precipitates in the alloy, resulting in decrease of toughness of the alloy. Therefore, Zn is added in an amount of 1.0 to 6.0% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the alloy, Zr is an element for finely dividing crystal particles. However, even if Zr is added in an amount exceeding 1% by weight, it is difficult for Zr to dissolve in the alloy. Therefore, Zr is added in an amount of 0 to 1.0% by weight. In other words, the alloy may not contain Zr. When the alloy contains Zr, the amount of Zr added is 1% by weight or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Rare earth element (R.E. for short) including lanthanoid improves heat resistance and castability of the alloy. To exhibit these effect remarkably, it is necessary to add rare earth element in an amount of 1% by weight or more. If rare earth element to be added exceeds 5% by weight, not only the effect of improving the castability is saturated, but also reaction between elements and a large amount of compounds decreases the toughness of the alloy. Therefore, rare earth element to be added is preferably 1.0 to 5.0% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present inventiion is described in more detail by reference to the following Examples and Comparative Examples. Test Examples in the Examples relating to the process of the present invention include the Examples and Comparative Examples, but are consideration examples of heat treatment conditions. Therefore, those are considered as the test examples and shown in the consecutive number. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Inner surface of high chromium alloy steel (Japanese Industrial Standard SUS430) crucible preheated in an electric furnace was coated with magnesium chloride flux. Pure magnesium was introduced into the crucible and melted. Metalic calcium-zinc-cerium based misch metal (Mm) was added to the resulting melt maintained at 700&deg; C. The temperature of the melt was further raised to 780&deg; C., an Mg-Zr alloy was added thereto, and the melt was stirred. After sufficient stirring, it was confirmed that those metals were completely dissolved, and flux refining was then conducted. After completion of the refining, the temperature was maintained at 780&deg; C. Incidentally, during the melting work, a mixed gas of carbon dioxide gas and SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>was blown to the melt surface at a flow rate of 0.2 liter/minute for preventing combustion, and also flux was appropriately strewed on the melt surface. The alloy melt thus obtained was die cast into a test piece shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Occurrence of hot tearing in high pressure die casting was confirmed visually or with &times; ray flaw detection, and sensibility of formability of hot tear of the alloy was qualitatively evaluated by &compfn; and &times;.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is apparent from the results shown in Table 1 aboe that the magnesium alloys of Examples 1 to 3 have formability of hot tearing equal to that of AZ91D which is a practical magnesium alloy. In contrast to this, the magnessium alloys of Comparative Examples 1 to 5 were apt to generate hot tearing. In more detail, the magnesium alloys of Comparative Examples 1-5 are alloys which do not contain at least one of the essential components (except for magnesium) in the alloy of the present invention (alloys of Comparative Examples 1 to 4) or the alloy wherein the rare earth element content is outside the range of the present invention (magnesium alloy of Comparative Example 5), and the formability of hot tearing easily occured in each alloy. Thus, the essential components other than magnesium are effective in the magnesium alloy of the present invention. In particular, even if the rare element content is slightly away from the range of the present invention, the hot tearing was apt to generate. Therefore, the effectiveness of the rare earth element content in the present invention can be understood from this fact. </paragraph>

The curve shows a change with the passage of time (horizontal axis: Ms) of strain (vertical axis). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, AZ91, AS41 and AE42 which are the conventional magnesium alloy each show large strain rate under the conditions of 150&deg; C. and 50 MPa, and the strain rate increases with the passage of time. On the other hand, an Mg-2% Zn-1%Ca alloy shows creep properties similar to those of AE42 under the conditions of 150&deg; C. and 64 MPa. However, the alloy of the present invention (Mg-2% Zn-0.6%Ca-2% Mm-0.5% Zr, wherein Mm is misch metal) shows very low strain rate similar to QE22 gravity cast material under the conditions of 150&deg; C. and 64 MPa, and the strain rate does not substantially increase with the passage of time. </paragraph>
