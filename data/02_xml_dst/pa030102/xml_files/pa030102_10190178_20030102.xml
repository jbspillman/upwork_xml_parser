<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a process for machining bores with a rotary shaft tool and a rotary shaft tool for performing the process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Rotary shaft tools have already become known for the machining of bores, and in particular for fine machining or high performance fine machining; they are constructed as reamers. The reamers have a shaft in which there extends at least one longitudinal channel for coolant/lubricant. The shaft is connected to a cutting head that has at least one chip groove and a groove outlet region. Such reamers for fine machining are known, for example, from German Standard DIN 2172, Part 1. Various parameters for cutter geometry include, for example, the chamfer length, the orthogonal rake angle, the cutting edge angle, the back rake, the minor cutting edge angle, the side rake, or the like. For example, for a machine reamer, a cutting edge angle &kgr; equal to 45&deg; is given. For hand reamers, the cutting edge angle &kgr; is equal to 20&deg;&minus;30&deg;. Thus cutting edge angles &kgr; of between 0&deg; and 45&deg; are given for DIN tools. The back rake &ggr; is in a region between 0&deg; and 15&deg;, according to the type of tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such rotary shaft tools have the disadvantage that during chip formation they form very long structures that come out as strips, such as, for example, flowing chips or ribbon chips, or helical chips, snarl chips or spiral chips. These chips become even further enlarged at very high cutting speeds, as is the case for the use of such shaft tools that are used in particular in conveyor lines, for example, in three-shift operation in automatic production. In the machining of blind holes, these long, strip-shaped chips are taken out of the blind hole in the direction of the shaft of the shaft tool. They lie and are wound around the shaft of the shaft tool. In the first place, the chips cannot be taken away fast enough, so that the chip remains in the bore for too long, and a damaged envelope surface of the bore can result. In addition to this, an introduction of the shaft tool into the next hole to be machined is made difficult, or stopping of the drill can be caused. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to provide a process for machining boreholes with shaft tools, in which a chip can be produced that breaks off short, and makes a rapid and secure chip removal from the borehole possible. This object is achieved by a process for high performance fine machining of boreholes employing a rotary tool having a shaft with at least one longitudinal channel for coolant and lubricant and a cutting head that has at least one cutting edge, a chip groove and a minor cutting edge with a back rake (&ggr;) of less than 0&deg;, and machining a borehole with a feed per revolution and per cutting edge of the shaft tool that depends on the difference between the diameter of the borehole and the rotary shaft cutting tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a rotary shaft tool that, based on the setting parameters of the major cutting edge and/or the minor cutting edge, makes possible a chip that breaks off short, particularly at given operating parameters. This object is achieved by a rotary shaft tool having a shaft with at least one longitudinal channel for coolant and lubricant, a cutter head joined to the shaft having at least one cutting edge at an angle (&kgr;) with respect to a longitudinal axis of the tool shaft, a minor cutting edge having a back rake (&ggr;) and a chip groove, in which the back rake (&ggr;) is between about less than 0&deg; and about &minus;20&deg;, and the relationship of the back rake (&ggr;) to the cutting edge angle (&kgr;) of the rotary shaft tool is such that the smaller the negative back rake (&ggr;) the larger the cutting edge angle (&kgr;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The process according to the invention has the advantage that by using the rotary shaft tool with a back rake having a minor cutting edge of less than 0&deg;, and a feed speed that substantially depends on the dimensions of the borehole to be machined, a short-breaking chip can be produced that in particular can be easily and quickly brought out of the blind hole. This short-breaking chip is produced by relating the cutting edge angle to the back rake, where a negative back rake makes possible a dragging cut and the chip is deflected to a large extent at the tool face. A higher fracture deformation can thereby be obtained. Furthermore, the short-breaking chip enables the machining parameters, in particular the feed, to be set so that a chip is formed that has a cross section that ranges from rectangular to square, preferably nearly square. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The deformation behavior for these very short-breaking chips is based on the following principles. In the known long and strip-shaped chips, the cross section of the chips has a very much greater chip width than the thickness of the chip. Consequently, the heat energy that arises during cutting can be fully taken up by the chip. The very thin structure of the chip makes it possible for the extension or the ductility of the chip, or its deformation behavior, to be substantially increased, and therefore no breaking of the chip can be attained. The invention, on the contrary, is based on the fact that the heat energy arising during cutting cannot be fully taken up in the substantially square cross section of the chip. Furthermore, a strong fracture deformation of the chip is produced because of the negative back rake, and is favored by the smaller uptake of heat energy. A very short-breaking chip can be produced in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The feed per revolution and per cutting edge increases with the dimension of the borehole. The feed per revolution and per cutting edge depends on the dimensions of the borehole to be machined, so that the ratios between the dimensions of the borehole and the feed are substantially equal, and preferably do not exceed a deviation of &plusmn;50%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By means of the process according to the invention, a defined, short-breaking chip formation can be attained that is transformed during the machining operation into a defined chip removal. This is of particular advantage at very high cutting speeds, in that the processing or operating safety is increased. The process can preferably be used in automatic production, for example, three-shift operation, or on conveyor lines, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The process for producing a rectangular to square cross section of a chip is particularly advantageous with a feed per cutting edge and per revolution of the shaft tool that relates to the dimension of the borehole to be machined. The cutting edge angle &kgr; of a major cutting edge is advantageously made greater than 45&deg;, preferably between 45&deg; and 90&deg;. For example, with a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 90&deg;, a nearly square cross section is attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The tool according to the invention has the advantage that the size of the cutting edge angle of the major cutting edge and of the back rake of the minor cutting edge make possible an even shorter chip break. For example, with a cutting edge angle &kgr; in the boundary region of 90&deg;, the back rake &ggr; is made less than &minus;5&deg; and can, for example, decrease as far as 0&deg; in this region. This is based on the fact that with a very large cutting edge angle &kgr; a relatively thick chip can be attained that has only a small deformability and breaks at a very small negative back rake. At the same time, a higher tool life and higher machining parameters, with maintained quality of the borehole, is made possible by thus making the back rake small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With a cutting edge angle &kgr; in a range between 45&deg; and 55&deg;, the back rake &ggr; is made larger, that is, between &minus;5&deg; and &minus;15&deg;, for example. The chip produced with these parameters has a preferably rectangular cross section, approximating a square cross section. Since the deformation behavior of this cross section is slightly larger than that of a square cross section, a very short-breaking chip can be produced by making the back rake &ggr; larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As long as the cutting edge angle &kgr; is made smaller than, for example, 45&deg;, the back rake &ggr; can be made more negative. The relationship between the cutting edge angle and the back rake is such that the angle of the cutting edge increases as the negative back rake decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the shaft tool according to the invention, making the cutting edge angle &kgr; greater than 45&deg; and the back rake of the minor cutting edge less than 0&deg;, a short-breaking chip is made possible with the use of the shaft tool as, in particular, a high performance reamer for fine machining of blind holes. In contrast to the parameters established by DIN 2172, Part 1, it has surprisingly been found that by making the cutting edge angle in fact greater than 45&deg; by making the back rake negative, a particularly short-breaking chip can be produced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a drill tool (reamer) that creates short breaking chips. The present invention describes a single rotary tool. The tool has at least one cutting edge. Each cutting edge has a back rake &ggr; and a cutting edge angle &kgr; that creates short breaking chips. The back rake &ggr; is less than 0&deg;. Selecting the back rake of the single rotary tool dictates the selection of the cutting edge angle. The cutting edge angle is adapted to the change in the back rake and vice versa. The angles are changed inversely relative to each other. In that sense, the cutting edge angle and the back rake are related to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Creating short breaking chips also depends upon the feed per revolution and per cutting edge of the cutting tool, and the difference between the diameter of the cutting tool and the diameter of the borehole after the hole is machined by the cutting tool. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>if the diameter of single the cutting tool is d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the diameter of the machined borehole is d<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the difference (d<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)&equals;0.2 mm, and the tool has only one cutting edge, then the feed of the rotary cutting tool would be 0.2 mm per revolution. If the tool has two cutting edges, then the feed would be 0.4 mm per revolution. With a feed of the cutting tool in a range of about 0.1 mm per revolution and per cutting edge to about 0.3 mm per revolution and per cutting edge, a chip is produced whose width is about three times its thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A rotary cutting tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and has a cylindrical shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> set in the cylindrical shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> described herein below is produced as a molded body of a cutting material. Alternatively, a cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be provided which is made of a less expensive material on which inset cutter plates are provided. This embodiment is particularly advantageous for cutter heads <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with an external diameter of, for example, 15-17 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has chip grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that are adjoined by a chip outlet region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the chip grooves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A coolant/lubricant channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> extends in the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in order to conduct coolant, lubricant or cooling liquid into the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A section of the cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along the line II-II in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has, for example, cutting edges <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that have lands made with different thicknesses, in order to make possible a smooth cutting behavior. The formation of the back rake angle &ggr; is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and will be described in more detail herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An enlarged view of the detail X of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The cutter head <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has an end face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that faces into a borehole, preferably into a blind hole, and that is adjoined radially outward by a major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is arranged, for example, at a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 60&deg; with respect to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The minor cutting edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> adjoins the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It is made long in comparison with the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and serves at the same time to guide the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The length of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is such that, at least seen in a projection onto the borehole, it is larger than the dimensions of the borehole to be machined. The cutting edge angle &kgr; is in the range between 45&deg; and 90&deg;. A cutting edge region of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, of &kgr; equal to 90&deg;, is shown with dashed lines as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The back rake &ggr; of the minor cutting edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is determined depending on the cutting edge angle &kgr; of the major cutting edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the reverse can be the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The cutting edge angle &kgr; and the back rake &ggr; are selected for the respective cases of use, in order to be optimal for the properties of the material, the dimensions of the borehole, the number of cutting edges or teeth, and also the cutting parameters. For example, a cutting edge of a shaft tool (not shown) can have a cutting edge angle &kgr; in a range of 0&deg; to &minus;45&deg;, and the back rake can be made negative, the magnitude of the negative back rake being related to the feed, the number of cutting edges, and the further operating parameters such as the material of the cutter, the material to be machined, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the minor cutting edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a negative back rake &ggr;, which is preferably in the range between 0&deg; and &minus;15&deg;. A dragging cut can be achieved in this manner, and can influence the deformation behavior of the chip. The relationship of the cutting edge angle &kgr; to the back rake &ggr;, or their mutual dependence, is such that the larger the cutting edge angle is made, the smaller the magnitude of the back rake &ggr;, and vice versa. It goes without saying that any optional variations in the preferred ranges of the cutting edge angle &kgr; between 45&deg; and 90&deg; and the back rake angle &ggr; between 0&deg; and &minus;20&deg; can also be provided. Furthermore, it can likewise be provided that the cutting edge angle &kgr; can be set to a given magnitude and the back rake &ggr; per cutting edge can be made of different magnitude. Any optional variation between the cutting edge angle &kgr;, the back rake &ggr;, and the number of teeth, or in relation to the cutting edge angle &kgr; and the back rake &ggr;, is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Cross sections of a produced chip are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The cross section of the chip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is produced by means of a rotary shaft tool that has, for example, a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 30&deg; and a back rake of &ggr; equal to &minus;15&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The cross sections <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are likewise produced with the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the invention. The shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for the production of the chip according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 60&deg; and a back rake of &ggr; equal to &minus;8&deg;, for example for machining steel. The cross section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the chip in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>was produced with a shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the process according to the invention, having a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 90&deg; and a back rake of &ggr; equal to &minus;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> These numerical data, set out as examples, are not limitative. On the contrary, an individual match to the material and to the working conditions and other peripheral conditions can be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>a partial detail is shown of a blind hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be machined, having a diameter before machining of d<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and a final measurement according to the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>after fine machining. The difference between the radius R<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>of the diameter d<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and the radius R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the diameter d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>forms the dimensions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the borehole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which determines the chip width b<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>in dependence on the cutting edge angle &kgr;. The chip thickness d<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is determined by the feed of the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for the fine machining of the blind hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, wherein according to the invention a feed in the range of 0.2-0.3 mm/revolution per tooth or cutting edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided. Thus the chip thickness corresponds to the feed of 0.2-0.3 mm. The feed can of course also include the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm per revolution and per tooth or per cutting edge. The term &ldquo;tooth&rdquo; and &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; have the same meaning. These data are dependent on the diameter of the tool, and are thus also dependent on the cutting edge used, so that smaller performance data can hold for smaller tools. This is related, in particular, to the fact that a smaller chip space is available at a smaller diameter, and sufficient chip removal has nevertheless to be insured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is advantageously provided that the dimensions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the borehole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be machined approximately relates to the feed per cutting edge, so that an about square cross section of the chip can be produced. It will be understood that it is also possible to depart from this relationship, a cross section being produced, however, which is substantially nearly square or like a rectangle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a cross section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is shown of a chip that is produced with a shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that was used as a high performance, multiple cutter, fine machining tool. Cutting speeds of, for example, between 100 m/min and 400 m/min, and a feed of 0.2-0.3 mm/revolution and per cutting edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> were employed for the production of a chip cross section of this kind. Other cutting speeds can apply. (As stated above, the feed can also include the range of 0 to 0.5 mm per revolution and per cutting edge). The cutting edge angle &kgr; of the major cutting edge has an angle of 60&deg;, so that an about rectangular cross section is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>a nearly square cross section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed according to the process according to the invention with the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the invention. The shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a cutting edge angle of &kgr; equal to 90&deg;. The operating parameters for fine machining of the blind hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> substantially correspond to the operating parameters described relating to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The fine machining of blind holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be assisted by coolant/lubricant. Cooling liquid under pressure, preferably under high pressure, can be forwarded to the end face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the coolant channel <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that runs centrally in the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The liquid is deflected at the bottom of the borehole and can be conducted out of the borehole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> via the chip outlet region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A reverse scavenging of this kind facilitates removal of the chips that are broken off short. Alternatively, air can also be used as a coolant/lubricant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The shaft tool <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be constructed as a multi-cutter friction tool or as a single-cutter friction tool and also as a tap. Further applications are also possible in which the parameters of cutting edge angle &kgr;, back rake angle &ggr; and feed of the shaft tool are matched to each other in order to produce a cross section of the chip that is short-breaking and that is of rectangular shape, nearly square, and/or substantially square. </paragraph>
