<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the monitoring of computer usage and, in particular, to a system and method for monitoring or recording a user&apos;s activity on a computer system by capturing the content on a display screen. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Background and Objects of the Present Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since the introduction of the personal computer in the early 1980&apos;s, the PC has been subject to constant change, ever increasing in capability and usage. From its earliest form in which the data accessible was limited to that which the user could load from a floppy disk to the typical gigabyte hard drives common on PCS today, the amount of data and the ease of obtaining this data have been growing rapidly. With the fruition of the computer network, the available data is no longer limited to the user&apos;s system or what the user can load on their system. Local Area Networks or LANs are now common in small businesses, and in such networks users may, in addition to their own local data, obtain data from other local stations as well as data that is available on the local server. Corporate networks and internetworks may connect multiple LANs, thereby increasing the data available to users. Larger still are Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), the latter of which is designed to cover large cities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The largest such network, commonly known as the Internet, has introduced vast amounts of information into the business place and the home. The individual networks that make up the Internet include networks which may be served from sources such as commercial servers (.com), university servers (.edu), research networks (.org, .net), and military networks (.mil). These networks are located throughout the world and their numbers are ever increasing with an estimated 85,000 new domain registrations presently occurring each month with countless Internet sites spawned from these domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With the exponential growth of the Internet and the explosion of interest worldwide, one natural consequence of this profundity is a growing diversity in the subject matter of the available information. Although this was the original intent of the Internet developers, there are obvious disadvantages and undesirable consequences of such a global information exchange. What is quickly becoming a notorious example of such occurrence is the proliferation of pornography, hate materials, and other materials, some of which may not only be offensive, but illegal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A specific difficulty encountered with the introduction of this powerful informational tool in the business and home is the logistical problem of governing the usage of the available data to specific users. In a corporate environment with access to, for example, the Internet, it is obviously advantageous for management to be able to limit or monitor in some fashion their employees&apos; usage of such a resource not only to ensure productivity but to prevent liability for inappropriate employee Internet activities. Likewise, in the home, a parent may desire to have the beneficial educational information that exists in great quantity on the Internet available for their child, but, at the same time, may wish to prevent that child from accessing inappropriate materials, either by intent or accident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the discussion that follows, &lsquo;operator&rsquo; will refer to the person attempting to monitor or block another person&apos;s activity on a computer system by any method or means. &lsquo;User&rsquo; will refer to the person whose computer activity is subject to being monitored or blocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Currently, those companies with the financial resources desiring the efficiency of exchanging information through the Internet may elect to use an intranet, e.g., a LAN. This way, the company can distribute information to its employees with the conveniences of the Internet, but without actually being connected to the Internet. The company may also either block specific domains from access by its employees, or give access to only specified domains. This may be achieved by appropriate software or coding to block domains at a gateway or firewall. However, these methods may not be financially or technically feasible, or this may not serve the companies&apos; intent in any regard. Also, this technique does not prevent employees from loading computer games on their computer and playing them during work hours. Often, a company may desire that its employees have unlimited access to data resources through the Internet with the only restriction being that their access is useful for fulfilling the duties of their jobs. In this instance, it would be counterproductive to give access to only certain domains, as doing so would block access to future domains that may provide information beneficial to serving well an employee&apos;s position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Commercially available applications to help combat this problem on the home or business PC are well known, such as Net Nanny&trade;, Surf Watch&trade;, and NetSnitch&trade;. These applications and their respective limitations are now discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Net Nanny&trade; is a software utility marketed to control, primarily, children&apos;s access to offensive Internet sites. This software&apos;s primary functionality is the use of an operator-defined, customized dictionary of terms or phrases to be blocked from access. In operation, Net Nanny&trade; performs a system shutdown whenever any material matching criteria in the operator-defined dictionary is accessed. This product works offline as well as online and performs a system shutdown when material matching specified criteria are accessed, where the material to be blocked could be loaded from floppy disks, CD-ROMS, local hard drives, network drives, or any other appropriate media. It can also be configured to provide the user a warning or to create a log of &ldquo;offenses&rdquo;&mdash;accesses to material that have been defined as offensive in the customized dictionary. Specific sites are also able to be blocked by the software operator, and similarly, the operator may make only certain sites available to be accessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although this specific, operator-defined approach is somewhat useful, a number of limitations are apparent. For example, in utilizing a customized dictionary to block sites by keyword, the operator is responsible for formulating a list of words or phrases that could be included on a site with offensive material. Any descriptive phrases or terminology overlooked or unknown by the operator may therefore be readily available to the user. In addition, material deemed offensive to the operator is not necessarily described on a website by offensive descriptive words that would be detected by the blocking software. For example, pornographic material may be served from a server in a numeric index format. In this case, graphic files may be sequentially numbered with no descriptive text on that site. In this instance, it would not be possible for the blocking software to detect the presence of the offensive graphic material. The same case would be true when operating the blocking software offline. Unless a graphic file, for instance, was named with a title that matched an offensive criteria, the file could be viewed without generating a detection by the blocking software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> SurfWatch&trade; is another program designed to block children&apos;s or employees&apos; access to offensive Internet sites. It is intended to solely block offensive Internet sites and is therefore utilized only for online activities. Primarily, it relies on blocking sites by use of a database that contains sites that have been determined to be offensive and by the use of keyword filters. The database is periodically updated and is available through a service with payment of a licensing fee. Through the licensing agency, criteria have been established as to what material is deemed offensive, which includes, but is not limited to, sexually explicit, violent, and/or illegal drug information. The software operator has configuration options available to alter the criteria by which Internet sites are blocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Again, the limitations are obvious. By relying on a licensing agent to develop updated databases of offensive sites, the operator is reliant on the agent to determine or locate any and all such sites containing material that is offensive. At best, the agent would be able to eliminate a large majority of such sites. It would not be reasonable, however, to expect such an agency to be able to locate every possible such site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there would exist a necessary delay in the creation of a new site containing offensive material and the time at which it is detected by the licensing agency and updated in the database of blocked sites. During that time, any user utilizing a system with the blocking software implemented by an operator would have unrestricted access to that site, assuming that the site did not contain descriptors matching those in the filtering module of the software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further problem of such a blocking method is that the operator is relying on a third party, the licensing agency, to concur with the operator in the subjective determination of what material is offensive. This method, in its most fundamental aspect, removes from the operator the ability to censor objectionable material as deemed objectionable by the operator. This limits the control of the operator to the task of formulating descriptive terms and phrases to be used by the filtering module, a method similar to and with limitations consistent with the previously discussed prior art application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another commercially available application is NetSnitch&trade; which does not actively block Internet sites, as the previously discussed art does, but instead creates a log of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that can later be reviewed and loaded by the software operator to determine what type of Internet sites have been visited by the user. It is designed to function online and, therefore, its usefulness is limited to online activities. When the user goes online, a log is activated which lists the specific Internet sites the user visits by recording that site&apos;s URL. It is, therefore, used as a monitor of user activity by allowing the software operator to later retrieve the log, and if desired, to go online and load the URLs one at a time to investigate what type of content is contained at the sites accessed by the user. As is apparent, this method does not offer any type of site blocking but gives, in one form, a complete history of the user&apos;s activity online, which is recorded by each site&apos;s URL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An obvious limitation of this method, however, is that it only works online. Offensive material may be loaded by floppy disk, for example, and viewed without the monitoring software ever being activated. Furthermore, for the operator to determine the user&apos;s online activity history, it is necessary for the operator to go online him or herself, and load each URL to investigate the material at each site, a time consuming and inconvenient task. Also, none of the above techniques is able to verify the user&apos;s actual activities, e.g., the content of a user&apos;s discussion in an on-line &ldquo;chat-box,&rdquo; which can be pornographic, racial or hate related. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, evident that the need exists for a convenient system and method for monitoring a computer user&apos;s activity by an operator, while not limiting the user&apos;s computing or informational allowances. Although a great deal of today&apos;s PC users&apos; data is generated from Internet usage, it has been established that a need exists for a software application to be effective offline, as well as online. It is further desired that no limitations be placed on what type of material is to be monitored and for the application to take no action against the user and, additionally, for the application to give no suggestion to the user of the application&apos;s operation. In doing so, the operator would have sole discretion as to what type of usage is objectionable or offensive and as to what course of action should be taken. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a system and method for monitoring computer usage. In a preferred embodiment, a computer operator specifies discrete moments of a computer&apos;s usage at which screen captures are executed and saved to a log. The operator, such as a parent, can later retrieve the screen images to provide a graphical record of the activities, such as that of their child, on that computer. The system and method of the present invention overcomes the limitations and inefficiencies of the prior art and gives full authority of determining what type of computer usage is inappropriate or offensive to the computer operator. Through the use of the present invention, an operator may determine not only whether or not a user&apos;s computer activity was inappropriate, but may also simply determine if the computer was operated in any manner. By employing the system and method of the disclosed invention, a record of a user&apos;s activity or inactivity is created that, in addition to being highly simple to evaluate, is an irrefutable account of the user&apos;s computer usage. Variations of the system and method allow the operator to direct monitoring events toward online activities.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a computer system incorporating the monitoring program according to the present invention. A file server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> connects remote computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the use of a network connection, generally represented by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. File server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> further connects computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the Internet <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via a gateway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Remote computers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are, in addition to their own local hard drives, equipped with external storage devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, respectively. Computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is further networked to include computer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operating remotely from it. Of course, the number and arrangement of the computers in the network depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> have been arbitrarily selected and in no way limit the merits of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that since the exact configuration of the computer system components may vary greatly, the present invention, as set forth in the proceeding discussion, would be effective in any number of network configurations. Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the various expansions or rearrangements on the network as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but also applies to a stand alone system, which may be defined as a computer system with no available resources outside its own physical devices. In addition, in the continuing discussion, reference will be made to operation of the invention in a network environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an example of the potential usage of the disclosed invention, the particular network configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is first considered in an office environment. In this example, an employer has employees operating from local computers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Employees are served files and Internet access through the server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In doing so, the employer wishes to discretely monitor the employees usage of their local computers. Utilizing the disclosed invention, the employer may go about this in a number of ways. The subject matter of the invention, which is preferably embodied in software, is loaded and configured on each of the employees&apos; computers, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. After some time of employee computer activity, the employer could return to each of these machines, and through functions later discussed, retrieve a visual log of the users&apos; activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The employer may also choose to run the invention from server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with specific configuration made for each employee computer, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The employer may only wish to monitor one employee, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for instance. The employer may feel that the employee on computer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is especially savvy and may feel it is a possibility that this employee would discover the operation of the disclosed invention on the local computer. With the network configuration shown, the employer could run a monitoring routine from computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the server <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with computer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> being the target for monitoring user activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that regardless of whichever computer usage is subject to being monitored in such a network environment, the disclosed invention may be run from the targeted computer, from a network server, or from any other computer sharing appropriate communication paths with the targeted computer. Furthermore, the retrieval and viewing of monitored computer usage is not limited to the targeted computer or the computer from which the monitoring function was implemented from, but instead, it could be viewed from yet another computer with appropriate communication paths between itself and the disclosed invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a main menu interface of the present invention. A number of configuration options are available to the operator. To implement the invention, the operator would select icon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Total,&rsquo; and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Manual Setup&rsquo; from these options. The &lsquo;Total&rsquo; option, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, specifies that the monitoring routine of the present invention will continuously monitor the computer usage, regardless of its operating condition. The &lsquo;Manual Setup&rsquo; option, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, specifies that the operator will determine at what discrete moments the monitoring routine will execute screen captures and save these screen captures in an activity log. After selecting options <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the operator must specify when the screen captures are to occur. This is done through an interface such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The screen capture interface prompts the operator for the discrete moments at which the screen captures are to be executed, and is activated from the interface of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> when the operator has selected either of options <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the example interface depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the operator is prompted for five distinct hourly moments at which the screen capture is to be executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The actual time of the executions are specified relative to each hour of the day and are governed by the system clock. The operator would then enter respective values in the areas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Entries are numerical values greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 60, i.e., 1-60 minutes. For example, if the operator entered &lsquo;03&rsquo; in the area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a screen capture would be executed and recorded at the first second of the third minute of each hour that the computer was running. This screen capture would be in addition to those entered in <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Again, all times are consistent with the system clock from which the present invention is operating. Although in the present example, five screen captures per hour are specified by the operator to be executed, it is nonetheless apparent that the number of screen captures performed is arbitrary and may vary pursuant to operator criteria or preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Once the operator has configured the program to the desired specifications, a confirmation message is generated informing the operator that the software is configured and ready to monitor a user&apos;s activity. No further action is then required by the operator until viewing the results. The system may be shut down or allowed to continue running. Either way, the program monitors a user&apos;s activity once the specified criteria in the program&apos;s configuration settings are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The operator may later retrieve the saved screen captures. The operator would begin the retrieval from the main menu, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Here, the operator has the option of viewing the activity log in <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> hour mode, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or am/pm mode, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. After selecting the mode, the operator selects option <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Show Saved Data.&rsquo; For security purposes, e.g., to prevent a child or employee from accessing or modifying the log, this option preferably activates a password screen. It should be understood, however, that password verification may be implemented during other parts of the monitoring routine, particularly in accessing the initial screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Ideally, the operator would be the only person with knowledge of the password. Once the operator has successfully entered the correct password, the monitoring routine prompts the operator to choose between viewing saved screens or saved statistics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Assuming the operator chooses to view the saved screens, an interface similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is activated. The operator can then choose to view all the saved screens by selecting the appropriate object, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, or the operator may choose to view the saved screens during a specific time period. To do this, the operator simply enters the range of dates and hours in areas <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The procedure would be the same in 24 hours mode except the time is entered in by selecting hours from 1 to 24 as opposed to selecting the hour and choosing am or pm in am/pm mode. When the operator makes their viewing selection, the first saved screen appears in a window with a date/time stamp appearing in the upper right hand corner. A sample interface for such a screen is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The operator then has the option to go forward to the next captured image <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, return to the previous image <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, or delete the captured image <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The operator can then view the next captured image by selecting object <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, marked &lsquo;Next&rsquo;. By viewing each consecutive image with the time/date stamp marked on it, the operator has a graphic time line of a user&apos;s activity on the computer. Assuming the program had been configured to operate continuously, any hourly time periods without any saved images would indicate a period of computer inactivity. Therefore, the operator has not only a historical profile of a user&apos;s activity, but can also gain information as to a user&apos;s periods of inactivity. A variation is included herein where an operator may not find it necessary to save actual images of a user&apos;s session, but may instead elect to save statistical information on a user&apos;s activities. This capturing of statistical information would be configured in a manner similar to that just described, only statistics such as download sites, times, dates, file names, sizes, applications running at specific times, and any number of other useful statistics lending information as to a particular user&apos;s computer activity would be entered in the log instead of an actual image of the screen capture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A variation on this embodiment would allow the operator to specify time periods of continuous monitoring. In this manner, the operator may specify periods when no monitoring is desired or stop the monitoring program from running until reactuated by the operator. In a business office, this would be convenient for off hours. A similar example for the home may be when a child is in school. By making adjustments in the configuration options of the invention, this would allow an operator to avoid unnecessary monitoring, thereby expediting future review of captured data and avoiding monitoring of incidental usage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the present invention, the operator may elect to have the times of screen capture execution automatically selected as opposed to manually entering the times. The operator is allowed this option by selecting <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Total,&rsquo; and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Random Savings,&rsquo; from the configuration interface shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In implementing this option, the software monitoring utility changes the time of the first through fifth screen captures each hour. This provides an added protection against a user who is capable of determining the intervals at which the screen capture is implemented. Although it is unlikely, it is possible a user could discover the occurrence of the monitoring event by tangible signals generated by the computer, such as a hard disk activity light. By using option <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the operator allows the times at which the screen captures are executed to vary by the hour, thus prohibiting the user from determining the particular minute or other time measure at which the capture will occur. The operator may then later retrieve captured images or statistics in a manner that is consistent with that described in the first embodiment. In a further modification, the program of the present invention allows the operator to specify periods when no monitoring is to be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment of the invention, a monitoring scheme more directed at determining a user&apos;s online activity is allowed. In this embodiment, the monitoring is not initiated until a modem download is detected. The operator may configure it to monitor at the discrete moments selected by the operator similar to the method described in embodiment 1. To do this, the operator would choose <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, &lsquo;Modem&rsquo;, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> &lsquo;Manual Setup&rsquo;, from the interface depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Doing so would activate the configuration screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At this modem-download interface, times are entered by the operator in the appropriate areas <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. One difference in the functionality of this configuration compared to the configuration described in the first embodiment is that in this configuration, screen captures are not executed until a modem download occurs. When a modem download occurs, the entries made by the operator in the interface depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are compared to the system clock and a capture is executed when a minute on the system clock is consistent with a minute entered by the operator at this interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that in operating the invention according to this embodiment, a user&apos;s session in which no online activity occurs will not be subject to monitoring. Accordingly, an operator would only use this configuration when interested solely in monitoring a user&apos;s online activity. The operator may then later retrieve captured images or statistics in a manner that is consistent with that described in the first embodiment. With additional modification, the invention allows the operator to specify periods when no monitoring is to be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the operator has another configuration available that may be directed to monitoring online activity. The operator may choose this configuration by respectively selecting <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the interface depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The functionality of this configuration is similar to that described in the second embodiment with the exception that screen captures are not executed until the detection of a modem download. For each modem download, screen captures will be executed at the first second of five randomly selected minutes over an hour interval, the pattern repeating for each hour designated. The operator may then later retrieve captured images or statistics in a manner that is consistent with that described in the first embodiment. With some modification, the invention allows the operator to specify periods when no monitoring is to be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In addition to password usage, a further degree of operational integrity may be implemented to increase the difficulty of a user deleting the saved images in the case the user is able to discover the operation of the disclosed invention. This may be done by introducing a series of keywords or numerical entries that must be correctly entered in order to confirm the deletion. Ideally, only the operator would be knowledgeable of such information, and thus, even if the user discovers the operation of the invention, the possibility of the user being capable of deleting the saved data or disabling the program is further minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Instead of a series of password requests, the program could instead require multiple request screens to cancel or delete the monitoring program or the stored data. Preferably, the number of distinct requests and requisite responses (clicks) handles the situation where the operator has forgotten the password and needs to cancel the program, e.g., before the harddrive falls. Although the user could in principle then delete the downloaded data (and even the monitoring program itself), the user would be unable to say the deletions were accidental if a large number, e.g., <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, of discrete steps were necessary to accomplish deletion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the series of screen downloads/statistical data, stored on the storage devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or upon the harddrives of the various computers depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, may be displayed as they appeared on the user&apos;s screen, e.g., display terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A of computer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, at the time of downloading, e.g., an image <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B thereon, or multiple such downloads displayed. In particular, the operator may select the manner of display and illustrate the user&apos;s usage of the computer by displaying multiple images/data alongside each other, e.g., an entire hour&apos;s worth of activity may be displayed on the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, each image being reduced in size and resolution to fit. The images may be aligned or overlaid to better show computer usage over longer periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that the intercepted screen downloads/statistical data or other data transmissions may be stored on the aforementioned storage devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, harddrives, zip drives or any other type of memory storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Although various embodiments of the method and apparatus of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
