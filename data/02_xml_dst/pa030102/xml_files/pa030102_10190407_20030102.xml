<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a contact structure and a production method thereof and a probe contact assembly using the contact structure, and more particularly, to a contact structure having a large number of contactors in a vertical direction and to a method for producing such a large number of contactors on a semiconductor wafer in a horizonal direction and removing the contactors from the wafer to be mounted on a substrate in a vertical direction to form the contact structure such as a contact probe assembly, probe card, IC chip, or other contact mechanism. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In testing high density and high speed electrical devices such as LSI and VLSI circuits, a high performance contact structure such as a probe card having a large number of contactors must be used. In other applications, contact structures may be used for IC packages as IC leads. The present invention is directed to a production process of such contact structures to be used in testing LSI and VLSI chips, semiconductor wafers, burn-in of semiconductor wafers and die, testing and burn-in of packaged semiconductor devices, printed circuit boards and the like. The present invention can also be applicable to other purposes such as forming leads or terminal pins of IC chips, IC packages or other electronic devices. However, for the convenience of explanation, the present invention is described mainly with reference to the semiconductor wafer testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the case where semiconductor devices to be tested are in the form of a semiconductor wafer, a semiconductor test system such as an IC tester is usually connected to a substrate handler, such as an automatic wafer prober, to automatically test the semiconductor wafer. Such an example is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in which a semiconductor test system has a test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is ordinarily in a separate housing and electrically connected to the test system with a bundle of cables <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are mechanically as well as electrically connected with one another with the aid of a manipulator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor wafers to be tested are automatically provided to a test position of the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by the substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor wafer to be tested is provided with test signals generated by the semiconductor test system. The resultant output signals from the semiconductor wafer under test (IC circuits formed on the semiconductor wafer) are transmitted to the semiconductor test system. In the semiconductor test system, the output signals are compared with expected data to determine whether the IC circuits on the semiconductor wafer function correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are connected through an interface component <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> consisting of a performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) which is a printed circuit board having electric circuit connections unique to a test head&apos;s electrical footprint, coaxial cables, pogo-pins and connectors. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a large number of printed circuit boards <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which correspond to the number of test channels (test pins) of the semiconductor test system. Each of the printed circuit boards <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has a connector <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to receive a corresponding contact terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;frog&rdquo; ring <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is mounted on the performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to accurately determine the contact position relative to the substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The frog ring <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a large number of contact pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, such as ZIF connectors or pogo-pins, connected to contact terminals <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, through coaxial cables <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is placed over the substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and mechanically and electrically connected to the substrate handler through the interface component <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In the substrate handler <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to be tested is mounted on a chuck <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In this example, a probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is provided above the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to be tested. The probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has a large number of probe contactors (such as cantilevers or needles) <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to contact with contact targets such as circuit terminals or contact pads in the IC circuit on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Electrical terminals or contact receptacles (contact pads) of the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to the contact pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> provided on the frog ring <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The contact pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are also connected to the contact terminals <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the coaxial cables <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> where each contact terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is connected to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, the printed circuit boards <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are connected to the semiconductor test system through the cable <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having, for example, several hundreds of inner cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Under this arrangement, the probe contactors <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> contact the surface (contact target) of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> on the chuck <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to apply test signals to the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and receive the resultant output signals from the wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The resultant output signals from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> under test are compared with the expected data generated by the semiconductor test system to determine whether the IC circuits on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> performs properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a bottom view of the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In this example, the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has an epoxy ring on which a plurality of probe contactors <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> called needles or cantilevers are mounted. When the chuck <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> mounting the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> moves upward in FIG. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the tips of the cantilevers <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> contact the pads or bumps (contact targets) on the wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The ends of the cantilevers <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> are connected to wires <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> which are further connected to transmission lines (not shown) formed in the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The transmission lines are connected to a plurality of electrodes (contact pads) <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> which are in communication with the pogo pins <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Typically, the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is structured by a multi-layer of polyimide substrates having ground planes, power planes, signal transmission lines on many layers. As is well known in the art, each of the signal transmission lines is designed to have a characteristic impedance such as 50 ohms by balancing the distributed parameters, i.e., dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of the polyimide, inductances and capacitances of the signal paths within the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Thus, the signal lines are impedance matched lines establishing a high frequency transmission bandwidth to the wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for supplying currents in a steady state as well as high current peaks generated by the device&apos;s outputs switching in a transient state. For removing noise, capacitors <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are provided on the probe card between the power and ground planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An equivalent circuit of the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to explain the limitation of the high frequency performance in the conventional probe card technology. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the signal transmission line on the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> extends from the electrode <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>, the strip (impedance matched) line <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, the wire <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the needle or cantilever (contact structure) <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Since the wire <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and needle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> are not impedance matched, these portions function as an inductor L in the high frequency band as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. Because of the overall length of the wire <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and needle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is around 20-30 mm, significant limitations will be resulted from the inductor when testing a high frequency performance of a device under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other factors which limit the frequency bandwidth in the probe card <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> reside in the power and ground needles shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</cross-reference>. If the power line can provide large enough currents to the device under test, it will not seriously limit the operational bandwidth in testing the device. However, because the series connected wire <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and needle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for supplying the power (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>) as well as the series connected wire <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and needle <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for grounding the power and signals (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>) are equivalent to inductors, the high speed current flow is seriously restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the capacitors <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are provided between the power line and the ground line to secure a proper performance of the device under test by filtering out the noise or surge pulses on the power lines. The capacitors <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> have a relatively large value such as 10 &mgr;F and can be disconnected from the power lines by switches if necessary. The capacitors <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> have a relatively small capacitance value such as 0.01 &mgr;F and fixedly connected close to the DUT. These capacitors serve the function as high frequency decoupling on the power lines. In other words, the capacitors limit the high frequency performance of the probe contactor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the most widely used probe contactors as noted above are limited to the frequency bandwidth of approximately 200 MHz which is insufficient to test recent semiconductor devices. In the industry, it is considered that the frequency bandwidth comparable to the tester&apos;s capability, which is currently on the order of 1 GHz or higher, will be necessary in the near future. Further, it is desired in the industry that a probe card is capable of handling a large number of semiconductor devices, especially memories, such as 32 or more, in a parallel fashion to increase test throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the conventional technology, the probe card and probe contactors such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are manually made, resulting in inconsistent quality. Such inconsistent quality includes fluctuations of size, frequency bandwidth, contact forces and resistance, etc. In the conventional probe contactors, another factor making the contact performance unreliable is a temperature change under which the probe contactors and the semiconductor wafer under test have different temperature expansion ratios. Thus, under the varying temperature, the contact positions therebetween vary which adversely affects the contact force, contact resistance and bandwidth. Thus, there is a need of a contact structure with a new concept which can satisfy the requirement in the next generation semiconductor test technology. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the method of the present invention further includes, after forming the contactors by depositing the conductive material, a step of placing an adhesive tape on the contactors so that upper surfaces of the contactors are attached to the adhesive tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the method of the present invention further includes, after forming the contactors by depositing the conductive material, a step of placing an adhesive tape on the contactors on the conductive substrate so that upper surfaces of the contactors adhere to the adhesive tape wherein adhesive strength between the contactor and the adhesive tape is larger than that between the contactor and the conductive substrate, and a step of peeling the conductive substrate so that the contactors on the adhesive tape are separated from the conductive substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the second present invention is a probe contact assembly including the contact structure of the present invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of contact structure of the present invention. The contact structure is configured by a contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In an application of semiconductor test, the contact structure is positioned, for example, over a semiconductor device such as a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to be tested. When the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is moved upward, the lower ends of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contact with the pads <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to establish electrical communication therebetween. The contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are mounted on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via through holes (not shown) at the middle portion so that an upper part and a lower part of the contactor are projected from the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The middle portion of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be loosely coupled to the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is movable when the contact structure is pressed against a contact target, such as the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a cantilever like shape over the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which extends diagonally upwardly to an upper end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The lower part of the contact is substantially straight extending downwardly to a lower end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor test application, the upper end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a base portion of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to contact with a probe card of the test system and the lower end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is a contact point of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to contact with the contact pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The cantilever (spring) portion of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> functions as a spring to produce a resilient force when the upper end is fixed to the probe card and the lower end is pressed against the contact target. The lower end (contact point) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably sharpened to be able to scrub the surface of the contact pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The resilient force promotes such a scrubbing effect at the contact point <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> against the surface of contact pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Such a scrubbing effect promotes an improved contact performance when the contact point scrubs the oxide surface of the contact pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to electrically contact the conductive material of the contact pad <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> under the oxide surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B show basic ideas of the present invention for producing such contactors. In the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are produced on a planar surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is a silicon substrate or other dielectric substrate in a horizontal direction, i.e., in a two dimensional manner. Then, the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are removed from the substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be mounted on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> such as a ceramic substrate, a printed circuit board, IC chip, or other contact mechanism in a vertical direction, i.e., in a three dimensional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, as noted above, the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are produced on a planar surface of a silicon or other dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction. Then, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are transferred from the substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to an adhesive member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, such as an adhesive tape, adhesive film or adhesive plate (collectively &ldquo;adhesive tape&rdquo; or &ldquo;intermediate plate&rdquo;). The contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are removed therefrom to be mounted on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in a vertical direction, i.e., in a three dimensional manner with use of a pick and place mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C show a specific example of contactor of the present invention wherein <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a front view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a side view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> is a bottom view thereof. The contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> has an upper end (base portion) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a middle point having a jaw (flange) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a spring portion (cantilever) having a diagonal beam running between the upper end and the middle point, a straight portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having a contact point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The upper end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> contacts with a probe card such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and the lower end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> contacts with the contact target such as a semiconductor wafer under test. When mounted on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the upper end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the spring portion (cantilever) are projected from the upper surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the lower end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is projected from the lower surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The straight portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is inserted in the through hole of the contact substrate while the jaw (flange) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> functions as a stopper against the upper surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the front view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the straight portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> preferably has a reduced width which promotes the spring action by the spring portion and the middle portion. In this example, as shown in the side view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B and the bottom view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has the same thickness throughout. Thus, when producing the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the planar surface of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, only one deposition process may be required for forming the contactor by conductive material. In the case where two or more different thickness are employed, conductive materials may be deposited two or more times to form tow or more layers of conductive material in the production process of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The example of size in the contactor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is: a&equals;400 &mgr;m, b&equals;50 &mgr;m, c&equals;50 &mgr;m, d&equals;50 &mgr;m, e&equals;140 &mgr;m, f&equals;900 &mgr;m, g&equals;1600 &mgr;m, h&equals;100 &mgr;m, i&equals;50 &mgr;m, j&equals;3100 &mgr;m, and k&equals;1900 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>L are schematic diagrams showing an example of production process for producing the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A, a</cross-reference> sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is typically a silicon substrate. Other dielectric substrate is also feasible such as a glass substrate and a ceramic substrate. The sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is made, for example, of silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) through a deposition process such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is to separate contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the silicon substrate in the later stage of the production process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An adhesion promoter layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed on the sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B through</cross-reference>, for example, an evaporation process. An example of material for the adhesion promoter layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes chromium (Cr) and titanium (Ti) with a thickness of about 200-1,000 angstrom, for example. The adhesion promoter layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is to facilitate the adhesion of conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is made, for example, of copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni), with a thickness of about 1,000-5,000 angstrom, for example. The conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is to establish electrical conductivity for an electroplating process in the later stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the next process, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed on the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> over which a photo mask <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is precisely aligned to be exposed with ultraviolet (UV) light as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference>. The photo mask <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shows a two dimensional image of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which will be developed on the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As is well known in the art, positive as well as negative photoresist can be used for this purpose. If a positive acting resist is used, the photoresist covered by the opaque portions of the mask <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> hardens (cure) after the exposure. Examples of photoresist material include Novolak (M-Cresol-formaldehyde), PMMA (Poly Methyl Methacrylate), SU-8 and photo sensitive polyimide. In the development process, the exposed part of the resist can be dissolved and washed away, leaving a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</cross-reference> having an opening or pattern &ldquo;A&rdquo;. Thus, the top view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</cross-reference> shows the pattern or opening &ldquo;A&rdquo; on the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having the image (shape) of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the photolithography process in the foregoing, instead of the UV light, it is also possible to expose the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with an electron beam or X-rays as is known in the art. Further, it is also possible to directly write the image of the contact structure on the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> by exposing the photoresist <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with a direct write electron beam, X-ray or light source (laser). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The conductive material such as copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), aluminum (Al), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), tungsten (W) or other metal, nickel-cobalt (NiCo) or other alloy combinations thereof is deposited (electroplated) in the pattern &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to form the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8G</cross-reference>. Preferably, a contact material which is different from that of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> should be used to differentiate etching characteristics from one another as will be described later. The over plated portion of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8G</cross-reference> is removed in the grinding (planarizing) process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8H</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The above noted process may be repeated for producing contactors having different thickness by forming two or more conductive layers. Namely, after forming a first layer of the contactors (conductive material), if necessary, the processes of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>H are repeated to form a second layer or further layer on the first layer of the contactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the next process, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is removed in a resist stripping process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8I</cross-reference>. Typically, the resist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is removed by wet chemical processing. Other examples of stripping are acetone-based stripping and plasma O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>stripping. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>J, the sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is etched away so that the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is separated from the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Another etching process is conducted so that the adhesion promoter layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are removed from the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8K</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The etching condition can be selected to etch the layers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> but not to etch the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other words, to etch the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> without etching the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as noted above, the conductive material used for the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must be different from the material of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Finally, the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is separated from any other materials as shown in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8L</cross-reference>. Although the production process in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>L shows only one contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in an actual production process, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, a large number of contactors are produced at the same time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a process which is equivalent to the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8I</cross-reference> where the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is removed in the resist stripping process. Then, also in the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, an adhesive tape (intermediate plate) <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is placed on an upper surface of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adheres to the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As noted above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, within the context of the present invention, the adhesive tape (intermediate plate) <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes other types of adhesive member, such as an adhesive film and adhesive plate, and the like. The adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also includes any member which attracts the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such as a magnetic plate or tape, an electrically charged plate or tape, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the sacrificial layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is etched away so that the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is separated from the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Another etching process is conducted so that the adhesion promoter layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are removed from the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in order to etch the conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> without etching the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the conductive material used for the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must be different from the material of the conductive layer. Although the production process in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C shows only one contactor, in an actual production process, a large number of contactors are produced at the same time. Thus, a large number of contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are transferred to the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and separated from the silicon substrate and other materials as shown in the top view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>N are schematic diagrams showing a further example of production process for producing the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where the contactors are transferred to the adhesive tape or intermediate plate. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, an electroplate seed (conductive) layer <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> which is typically a silicon or glass substrate. The seed layer <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is made, for example, of copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni), with a thickness of about 1,000-5,000 angstrom, for example. A chrome-inconel layer <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> is formed on the seed layer <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B through</cross-reference>, for example, a sputtering process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the next process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C, a</cross-reference> conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> is formed on the chrome-inconel layer <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. The conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> is made, for example, of nickel-cobalt (NiCo) with a thickness of about 100-130 &mgr;m. After passivating the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> with a thickness of about 100-120 &mgr;m is formed on the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D and a</cross-reference> photo mask <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is precisely aligned so that the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is exposed with ultraviolet (UV) light as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</cross-reference>. The photo mask <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> shows a two dimensional image of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which will be developed on the surface of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the development process, the exposed part of the resist can be dissolved and washed away, leaving a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</cross-reference> having a plating pattern transferred from the photo mask <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> having the image (shape) of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>G, contactor material is electroplated in the plating pattern on the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> with a thickness of about 50-60 &mgr;m. An example of the conductive material is nickel-cobalt (NiCo). The nickel-cobalt contactor material will not strongly adhere to the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> made of nickel-cobalt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the case where the contactor has two or more different thickness, the above noted process may be repeated for producing the contactor by forming two or more conductive layers. Namely, after forming a first layer of the contactors, if necessary, the processes of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>G are repeated to form a second layer or further layers on the first layer of the contactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the next process, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> is removed in a resist stripping process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10H</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>I, the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> is peeled from the chrome-inconel layer <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> is a thin substrate on which the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are mounted with a relatively weak adhesive strength. The top view of the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> having the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10J</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

Thus, when the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is removed from the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are transferred from the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> to the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10L</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10M</cross-reference> shows a top view of the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereon and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10N</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereon. </paragraph>

The pick and place mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> is advantageously applied to the contactors produced by the production process of the present invention described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>D and FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>N involving the adhesive tape. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> is a front view of the pick and place mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> showing the first half process of the pick and place operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> is a front view of the pick and place mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> showing the second half process of the pick and place operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this example, the pick and place mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is comprised of a transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to pick and place the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, mobile arms <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to allow movements of the transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in X, Y and Z directions, tables <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> whose positions are adjustable in X, Y and Z directions, and a monitor camera <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> having, for example, a CCD image sensor therein. The transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> includes a suction arm <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> that performs suction (pick operation) and suction release (place operation) operations for the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The suction force is created, for example, by a negative pressure such as vacuum. The suction arm <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> rotates in a predetermined angle such as 90 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In operation, the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> having the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having the bonding locations <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (or through holes) are positioned on the respective tables <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the pick and place mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> picks the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by suction force of the suction arm <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. After picking the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the suction arm <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> rotates by 90 degrees, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>. Thus, the orientation of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is changed from the horizontal direction to the vertical direction. This orientation change mechanism is just an example, and a person skilled in the art knows that there are many other ways to change the orientation of the contactors. The transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> then places the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the bonding location <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (or through holes) on the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by being bonded to the surface or inserted in the through holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view showing an example of total stack-up structure for forming a probe contact assembly using the contact structure of the present invention. The probe contact assembly is used as an interface between the device under test (DUT) and the test head such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In this example, the probe contact assembly includes a routing board (probe card) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and a pogo-pin block (frog ring) <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provided over the contact structure in the order shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The contact structure is configured by a plurality of contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mounted on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A base portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of each of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is projected at an upper surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A contact portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is projected from a lower surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the present invention, a spring portion between the base portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the intermediate portion that is coupled to the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a cantilever shape inclined upwardly from the contact substrate. The contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be slightly loosely inserted in through holes on the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a manner allowing a small movement in the vertical direction when pressed against the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, pogo-pin block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and contact structure are mechanically as well as electronically connected with one another, thereby forming a probe contact assembly. Thus, electrical paths are created from the contact point of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the cables <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Thus, when the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the probe contact assembly are pressed with each other, electrical communication will be established between the DUT (contact pads <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on the wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>) and the test system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The pogo-pin block (frog ring) <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is equivalent to the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> having a large number of pogo-pins to interface between the probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. At upper ends of the pogo-pins, cables <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> such as coaxial cables are connected to transmit signals to printed circuit boards (pin electronics cards) <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the test head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> through the performance board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> has a large number of electrodes <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> on the upper and lower surfaces thereof. When assembled, the base portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contact the electrodes <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The electrodes <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> are connected through interconnect traces <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> to fan-out the pitch of the contact structure to meet the pitch of the pogo-pins in the pogo-pin block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Because the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are loosely inserted in the through holes of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the springs (cantilevers) provided close to the base portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> produce resilient contact forces toward the electrodes <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> as well as toward the contact pads <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> when pressed against the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view showing another example of probe contact assembly using the contact structure of the present invention. The probe contact assembly is used as an interface between the device under test (DUT) and the test head such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In this example, the probe contact assembly includes a conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and a pogo-pin block (frog ring) <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provided over the contact structure. Since the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has the spring (cantilever) between the base portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the middle portion as mentioned above, such a conductive elastomer is usually unnecessary. However, the conductive elastomer may be still useful for compensating the unevenness of the gaps (planarity) between the probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the contact structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is provided between the contact structure and the probe card <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. When assembled, the base portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contact the conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is an elastic sheet having a large number of conductive wires in a vertical direction. For example, the conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is comprised of a silicon rubber sheet and a multiple rows of metal filaments. The metal filaments (wires) are provided in the vertical direction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, i</cross-reference>.e., orthogonal to the horizontal sheet of the conductive elastomer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. An example of pitch between the metal filaments is 0.05 mm or less and thickness of the silicon rubber sheet is about 0.2 mm. Such a conductive elastomer is produced by Shin-Etsu Polymer Co. Ltd, Japan, and available in the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view showing details of contact structure of the present invention incorporated in the probe contact assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. The contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having the cantilever spring is attached to the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a manner that the middle portion of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted in a through hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The contact portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the straight middle portion is inserted in a through hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this example, the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a multi-layered substrate having three standard silicon wafers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>which are stacked and fusion bonded to one another. An example of thickness of each of the silicon wafers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is about 0.5 mm. The based portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having the cantilever shape spring is projected from the upper surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a flange like portion (jaw) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be fitted with an upper surface of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> close to the through hole <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A contact point <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at the tip of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably sharpened to promote the scrubbing effect on the surface of the contact target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The process of forming three layered substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and through holes thereon shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is briefly explained in the following. First, the second wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the third wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are directly bonded through, for example, silicon fusion bonding. Then the wafers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are polished both front and back, and through holes are created therethrough by an etching process. Such a deep trench etching is achieved, for example, by reactive ion etching using a reactive gas plasma. The size of the through holes on the second and third wafers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be smaller than the flange like portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the contactor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when it is necessary to form steps in the through holes for the purpose of mounting the contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Then, the first wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is polished its front and back surfaces and through holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are created therethrough by the deep trench etching noted above. The first wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is aligned and fusion bonded to the second and third wafers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. For insulation, silicon oxide layers of, for example, at least one micrometer is preferably grown on all of the exposed surfaces of the contact substrate produced in this manner. </paragraph>

This example shows a plurality of contact substrates or contact structure blocks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be assembled with one another to build a contact structure of desired size and desired number of contactors. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, although each contact structure block includes contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> assembled in a single line, a contact structure block of the present invention may include contactors aligned in two or more lines, i.e, a matrix manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As noted above, one of the features of the present invention is the capability of combining a plurality of contact structure blocks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create a contact structure (probe contact assembly) of increased overall size and number of contactors. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, four contact structure blocks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are prepared to be connected to one another. Although not shown in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, but shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, each contact structure block <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a connection or engagement mechanism such as teeth at the outer edges thereof. </paragraph>

In this example, five contact substrates are connected with one another to create a contact structure having an overall size which is an integer multiple of the size of the contact structure block. For simplicity of illustration, the contactors are not shown on the contact substrates (wafers) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. By combining the contact substrates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in this manner, a contact assembly of desired size such as equivalent to the size of a twelve-inch semiconductor wafer can be established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this example, the right and left edges of the contact substrate are provided with engagement teeth <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and recesses <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The size of the tooth <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the size of the recess <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are the same in the right and left edges, however, the position of the tooth <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and recess <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is shifted by one unit. Thus, the left edge of one contact substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> fits with the right edge of the another contact substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> projection is provided at a distal end of the contact substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to fit in a groove <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at a proximal end of another contact substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Instead of using the projections and grooves, it is also possible to use the teeth and recesses such as in the right and left edges described above. The contactors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be mounted on the contact substrates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> in through holes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the contact structure has a very high frequency bandwidth to meet the test requirements of next generation semiconductor technology. Since the large number of contactors are produced at the same time on the substrate without involving manual handling, it is possible to achieve consistent quality, high reliability and long life in the contact performance. Further, because the contactors are assembled on the same substrate material as that of the device under test, it is possible to compensate positional errors caused by temperature changes. Further, it is possible to produce a large number of contactors in a horizontal direction on the silicon substrate by using relatively simple technique. The contact structure produced by the present invention is low cost and high efficiency and has high mechanical strength and reliability. The contact structure produced by the method of the present invention are advantageously applied in testing a semiconductor wafer, packaged LSI, multi-chip module and the like including burn-in testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Although only a preferred embodiment is specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing the spirit and intended scope of the invention. </paragraph>
