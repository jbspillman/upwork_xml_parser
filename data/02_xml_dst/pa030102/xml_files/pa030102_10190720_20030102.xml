<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An image transcription method of transcribing an image of the dye on a printing sheet outputted by e.g., a video printer onto a substrate for transcription, such as a cup of pottery or the like. For transcription, a resin is coated on the surface of the substrate for transcription to form a reception layer. This reception layer is dried in an electrical oven to form a support for transcription. A printing sheet carrying an image of a sublimable dye is stacked on the reception layer of the support for transcription and pressured to the reception layer under application of heat and pressure. As the resin for the reception layer, the acrylic resin or the epoxy resin or both are employed.

The distance between the spray gun and the substrate for transcription is set to 100 mm&plusmn;5 mm, while the drying temperature is 170 to 180&deg; C. The thickness of the reception layer is 10 to 50 &mgr;m. After transcribing the image of the sublimable dye to the reception layer, a transparent film is bonded, if necessary, as a protective film on the reception layer. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for thermal transcription of an image outputted by a video printer or the like. The present invention also relates to a support for transcription and an ink ribbon employed therefor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An image from a video scanner or a video camera, captured into a thermal sublimation type video printer and printed out on a printing sheet, can be handled in a similar manner to a silver salt photograph and a variety of pictures can be easily enjoyed subject to promulgation of such system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Attempts have also been made for enjoying this system in a manner different from the silver salt photograph. Thus a new article of commerce obtained on transcribing an output image of the video printer on an arbitrary support for transcription, such as a cup of pottery, or a so-called mag-cup, has also been developed. If, in a meeting hall, a still video picture shot by an electronic still camera is transcribed on a mag-cup etc. on the spot, the article would be improved significantly in commercial value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For transferring an output image of the video printer to a support for transcription, a reception layer is required on the support surface for fixing the dye since the dye cannot be fixed if simply it is attempted to transcribe the dye to the mag-cup surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Excellent weatherability is required of the reception layer. To this end, an epoxy based resin has been employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The epoxy based resin is a thermosetting resin and, if this resin is coated and printed on e.g., the mag-cup surface, the reception layer excellent in weatherability may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With the above-described image transcribing method, the properties of the reception layer affects the properties of the picture and hence it has been desired to improve these properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If, for example, the reception layer is coated and formed using various resins, the dyeing step is carried out using a hot air drying oven or the like. However, a problem has been raised in connection with discoloration of the reception layer due to e.g., difficulties in controlling the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the reception layer is formed of the epoxy-based resin, transcription takes a lot of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If a sublimable dye is to be transferred to the mag-cup having the reception layer formed of the epoxy based resin, the transcription time continuing for about three minutes is required for a press working temperature of 170&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In case of mass production, the shorter the time of transcription, the more significantly the productivity is improved. However, the time of transcription of three minutes cannot be said to be short. In particular, if a still video image shot with e.g., an electronic still camera is transferred to the mag-cup or the like and sold on the spot, since the processable quantity is governed by the time of transcription, the time of transcription as long as three minutes is extremely undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, although the reception layer formed of e.g., the epoxy based resin, is itself superior in durability and weatherability, the dye transcribed thereon is simply affixed on the reception layer and cannot be said to be sufficient in weatherability such that it is susceptible to color fading or discoloration. In addition, the reception layer is insufficient in resistance against solvents or chemicals, such that the dye image is easily vanished on contact with e.g., an organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The reception layer usually has its surface smoothed for improving the transcription efficiency, such that only the surface reflecting an extraneous light is produced. The result is limited usage due to constraint on the appearance and a demand for a variegated appearance laid in case of a building material cannot be met sufficiently. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention is proposed for overcoming the above-described inconvenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for transcribing a picture whereby a transcribed picture of high quality may be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for transcribing a picture and a support for transcription whereby a picture of a sublimable dye can be transcribed in a short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for transcribing a picture whereby not only the reflective surface but also a variety of surface states can be realized and a variety of demands in connection with appearance can be met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image transcribing method for transcribing an image of a sublimable dye onto a reception layer comprising coating a resin on the surface of a substrate for transcription for forming a reception layer, drying said reception layer in an electrical oven for forming a support for transcription, stacking a printing sheet carrying an image of a sublimable dye on the reception layer of the support for transcription and pressuring said printing sheet onto the reception layer under heat for transcribing the image of the sublimable dye to the reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By employing an electrical oven for drying the reception layer, precise temperature control becomes possible, such that the reception layer may be prohibited from being discolored and a transcribed image may be produced. Simultaneously, foreign matter may be prohibited from being mixed during drying by a hot air drying oven to prohibit the lowering in the product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If, for coating a reception layer, a cup formed of pottery is employed as a substrate for transcription, the resin is applied by a spray gun as the cup is reversed for forming the reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In particular, if the resin composed mainly of an acrylic resin, the drying temperature is set to 170 to 180&deg; C., the viscosity of the resin is set to 43 to 52 seconds in terms of the Ford cup density, the discharge pressure of the resin from the spray gun is set to 35 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plusmn;0.01 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the distance between the spray gun and the substrate for transcription is set to 100 mm&plusmn;5 mm. The thickness of the reception layer formed as described above is set to 10 to 50 &mgr;m. This enables a uniform reception layer to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> After transcribing the sublimable dye image to the reception layer, a transparent film may be formed on the reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the transparent film, an acrylic film, for example, may be employed. The transparent film may contain a UV ray absorber. By embossing the transparent film, a variety of different surface states may be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> If, for example, an image of a sublimable dye outputted from a video printer, is transcribed to a support for transcription, the image of the dye is simply deposited on the reception layer formed on the surface of the support for transcription, so that the image is poor in weatherability or resistance against solvents or chemicals and color fading or discoloration is incurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By layering and bonding a transparent film such as a film of acrylic resin as a cover coating on the reception layer, the transparent film operates as a protective layer for significantly improving weatherability and resistance against solvents or chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although the resin constituting the reception layer is optional, a reception layer composed of the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin is formed on the surface of the substrate for transcription for constituting a support for image transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this case, the second reception layer composed mainly of the acrylic resin may be layered and formed on the first reception layer mainly composed of the epoxy resin, or alternatively, a reception layer containing both the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin may be formed on the first reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although the epoxy resin is superior in durability and weatherability, it is insufficient in transcription speed when used as a reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although the acrylic resin is superior in transcription speed, it leaves much to be desired in weatherability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By simultaneously using the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin, the merits of the two are exploited in a complementing manner for achieving compatibility between the transcription speed and weatherability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As an ink ribbon for forming an image of the sublimable dye on a printing sheet, an ink ribbon comprised of plural pigment containing layers of different colors arrayed in a pre-set sequence on a strip-shaped substrate, is employed. In this case, it is preferred that a lubricant such as silicon oil be contained in the pigment containing layer printed for the last time or the lubricant containing layer be formed next to the pigment containing layer printed for the last time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If, in an ink ribbon comprised of plural pigment containing layers of different colors arrayed in a pre-set sequence on a strip-shaped substrate, a lubricant is contained in the pigment containing layer printed for the last time or the lubricant containing layer is formed next to the pigment containing layer printed for the last time, the lubricant contained in the pigment containing layer or in the lubricant containing layer is transferred and deposited to the printing sheet surface when the image is printed by pressuring the ink ribbon against the printing sheet for printing the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If the lubricant is deposited in this manner to the printing sheet, lubricity may be accorded to the printing sheet by the lubricant. In addition, when the printing sheet is layered on the support for transcription, such as a mag-cup, air bubbles intruded into the space between the printing sheet and the support for transcription tend to be discharged to outside so that creases are less liable to be produced. Thus a satisfactory image free of non-transcribed portions can be re-transferred to the support for transcription without the necessity of rubbing the printing sheet surface with a spatula.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The special resin employed here is mainly composed of an acrylic resin and also contains an extender, an adhesion accelerator and an anti-foaming agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Examples of the extender include silica, alumina, alumina silicate, calcium carbonate, mica and quartz powders. Although there is no limitation to the amount of the extender employed provided that it suffices for adjusting flow characteristics of the composition, it is usually 2 to 20 parts by weight and preferably 2 to 4 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the acrylic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Examples of the adhesion accelerators include silane coupling agents such as &ggr;-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane, N-&bgr;(aminoethyl)-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, N-&bgr;(aminoethyl)-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane or &ggr;-chloropropyl trimethoxy silane. Although there is no limitation to the amount of the adhesion accelerator employed, the usual amount is on the order of 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0.07 to 3 parts by weight, to 100 parts by weight of the acrylic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Examples of the anti-foaming agents include known siloxane based anti-foaming agents, such as polyether-modified methylalkyl polysiloxane or polyester modified polydimethyl siloxane. Although there is no limitation to the amount of the anti-foaming agents, it is usually 0.05 to 5 parts by weight and preferably 0.07 to 3 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the acrylic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The above special resin is mixed with an organic solvent for dilution, such as xylene, and adjusted to give a viscosity of 43 to 52 seconds, for example, a viscosity of 48 seconds, in terms of the Ford cup viscosity (JIS). If the viscosity of the resin is lower than this range, the reception layer is reduced in thickness and poor in transcription characteristics. Conversely, if the viscosity is too high, the reception layer becomes poor in homogeneity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> After adjusting the mixing ratio in this manner, the special resin is coated on the mag-cup, using e.g., an air-less coater manufactured by NORDSON INC. while the mag-cup is rotated for 0.12 second in the positive direction and then rotated in reverse for 0.29 second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> If the coating time is too long, the coating thickness becomes excessive such that the resin is solidified in a dripping state. Conversely, if the coating time is too short, the reception layer becomes too thin to deteriorate the transcription characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The purpose of rotating the mag-cup in reverse during coating is to eliminate irregular coating (it is noted that this condition is that for the temperature of 25&deg; C. and the condition is changed with changes in temperature). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The nozzle employed for coating by the air-less coated manufactured by NORDSON INC. is the type &num;4. Coating cannot be achieved satisfactorily with type &num;3 nozzle nor with type &num;5 nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At this time, the resin discharge pressure from a coating gun is 35 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plusmn;0.01 kg/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, while the distance between the coating gun and the substrate for transcription is set to &plusmn;5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> After lapse of not less than 180 seconds after coating, drying for not less than 40 minutes is carried out in a drying oven maintained at 170&deg; to 180&deg; C. The drying oven used is an electric oven. If the drying time is too short, the resin is not solidified, whereas, if the drying time is too long, power is wasted, although the properties of the product are not affected by the prolonged drying time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> By carrying out the above processing, the reception layer for re-transcribing an image of the sublimable thermal transfer system on the mag-cup can be formed on the mag-cup to a thickness of 10 to 50 &mgr;m. If the thickness of the reception layer is less than 10 &mgr;m, the transcribed layer becomes pale in color, whereas, if the thickness of the reception layer exceeds 10 &mgr;m, the resin is solidified in the dripping state, thus giving an ill-looking surface appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> With the above process, a reception layer is produced which has a surface hardness of 1H in terms of the pencil-scratch strength according to JIS and exhibits acceptable surface whiteness and other states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> There is no limitation to the material of the reception layer such that the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin may be employed in combination. The mode of employing these two resins in combination may be roughly classified into two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The first mode is to superimpose a layer of an epoxy based resin and a layer of an acrylic resin and the resulting assembly is used as a reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Although there is no limitation to the number of layers or the layering sequence, it is preferred in view of the transcription efficiency to apply and print the epoxy-based resin on the substrate for transcription and subsequently to coat and print the acrylic resin thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> If the above-described layered structure is used, the thickness of the reception layer in its entirety, that is the thickness of the epoxy resin layer plus the thickness of the acrylic resin layer, is preferably 10 to 50 &mgr;m, while the thickness of the acrylic resin layer is preferably 10 to 90% and more preferably 10 to 70% of the entire thickness. If the thickness of the acrylic resin layer is too thick or too thin, the merit of employing the resin layer in combination with the epoxy resin layer is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The second mode is mixing the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin and to coat and print the resulting mixture on the substrate for transcription to give a reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> At this time, the thickness of the reception layer is preferably 10 to 50 &mgr;m. On the other hand, the proportion of the acrylic resin contained in the reception layer is preferably 10 to 90 wt % and more preferably 10 to 70 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin are mixed together in this manner to give a reception layer, resins other than the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin, such as polyester resins etc., may be mixed in the reception layer. In addition, a layer of resins other than the epoxy resin and the acrylic resin, such as polyester resins etc., may be layered on the reception layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> While any desired substrate for transcription may be used in the present invention, products of pottery, such as a drinking cup formed of pottery, or so-called mag-cup, may be employed. Of course, the present invention may be applied to a variety of tiles or tableware other than mag-cups. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the color heat-transfer ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is loaded on the video printer, the photosensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> projects light from the light projecting portion thereof onto the reflector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and receives the light reflected back from the reflector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> at the light receiving portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> This turns on the photosensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which then transmits data advising to the controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the effect that the color heat-transfer ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operate as media for transcription. If the color heat-transfer ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are media other than those for transcription printing, no reflector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is provided on the lateral surface of the color heat-transfer ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that the photosensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is maintained in the off-state thus enabling the medium to be identified as a medium other than the medium for transcription printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A memory <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> stores the digital input signal as selected by the switching unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and reads it out at a pre-set timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> controls the heat-transcription printer and is constituted by a CPU. The controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> reads out data from the memory <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and converts digital signals by a D/A converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into analog signals which are sent to a monitor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> When effecting printing on the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> under application of a pressure of the heat-transcription ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> against a thermal head under heating, the &ggr;-correction circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> effects &ggr;-correction for optimizing the concentration of the transferred image. This &ggr;-correction is carried out in such a manner as not to affect coloration characteristics of the media for transcription printing made up of the color heat-transcription ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the preset case, characteristics of the &ggr;-correction are changed depending upon whether the color heat-transcription ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are the media for heat-transcription printing or media other than those for transcription printing, and also upon whether or not the input signal is a signal in need of left/right reversal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> After &ggr; correction performed by the &ggr;-correction circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a manner suitable for the printing medium, the digital input signal is fed to a thermal head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via a thermal had driver <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The thermal head <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> heats a color heat-transcription ink ribbon <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for printing an image on the printing sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Although the ink ribbon employed for the video printer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is optional, such an ink ribbon may be employed in which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, plural pigment-containing layers with different coloration <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed in parallel in a pre-set sequence on a strip-shaped substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and in which a lubricant is contained in the pigment-containing layer printed for the last time, for thereby improving transcription characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The pigment-containing layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are comprised of pigments, such as yellow, magenta or cyan, contained in optional resin materials. For example, yellow pigment containing layers Y, magenta pigment containing layers M and cyan pigment containing layers C are repeatedly arrayed in this order in parallel on the strip-shaped substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. With the present ink ribbon, a lubricant for smoothing the surface of the printing sheet is contained in the cyan-color pigment containing layer C, which is printed last among the three pigment-containing layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> That is, with the present ink ribbon <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the pigment containing layers Y, M and C ate stacked on the printing sheet in the arraying sequence and the pigment-containing layers and the printing sheet are partially heated and pressured for printing an image so that he yellow pigment, magenta pigment or the cyan pigment will be transcribed on required portions on the printing sheet in accordance with the image information captured into the video printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, on which an image is transcribed by this ink ribbon <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, is comprised of a substrate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a reception layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> into which the pigments are transcribed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> On heating and pressuring the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the pigment-containing layers of the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the respective pigments <highlight><uline>y</uline></highlight>. <highlight><uline>m</uline></highlight> and <highlight><uline>c</uline></highlight> from the pigment-containing layers are transcribed in superimposition on the reception layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> If now a lubricant is contained in the cyan pigment containing layer C, printed for the last time, when the cyan pigment containing layer C is stacked on the printing sheer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and pressured under heating, the lubricant contained in the cyan containing layer C is transferred and deposited to the surface of the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for imparting lubricity to the surface of the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> With the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, to which lubricity has been imparted as described above, air bubbles entering the space between the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the support for transcription during the time the sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is superimposed on a support for transcription, such as mag-cup, for re-transferring the image, are liable to be discharged to outside, while creases are less liable to be produced. Thus an image of an excellent quality free of non-transcribed portions may be re-transcribed on the support for transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Although it may be contemplated to directly apply a lubricant on the surface of the printing sheet or the surface of the support for transcription, the number of steps is increased, while the operator&apos;s hand may be contaminated with the lubricant. With the present invention, the above-described advantages may be derived while avoiding such inconvenience, so that the method may be said to be highly meritorious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As the lubricant, those commonly employed without affecting pigment transcription or coloration are selected. For example, silicon oil is suitable. In addition, higher fatty acids, such as myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid or oleic acid, metal or amine salts thereof, esters of fatty acids and alcohols, alkyl-phosphoric acid ester, perfluoro polyether and modified products thereof, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> For protecting the substrates from heat devolved by the thermal head, it is possible to provide a protective layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> on the side of the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> opposite to the pigment containing layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, while it is also possible to provide a protective layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on the side of the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> opposite to the reception layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As for the ink ribbon, a lubricant containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> may also be formed next to the last-printed pigment containing layer, herein the cyan containing layer C, separately from the pigment containing layer, in place of containing the lubricant in the last-printed pigment-containing layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> With the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, provided with the lubricant-containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, a yellow-pigment containing layer Y, a magenta pigment containing layer M and a cyan pigment containing layer C are layered in this order on the printing sheet and pressured under heat application. Finally, the lubricant-containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is layered on the printing sheet and pressured under heat application. The lubricant contained in the lubricant containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is transferred to and deposited on the surface of the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for imparting lubricity to the surface of the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. If the lubricant is contained in the pigment-containing layer, it is feared that variation may be produced to more or less extent in the amount of the lubricant transferred to the printing sheet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, because pressuring and heating are local depending on the image information. If the lubricant containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is provided in this manner, pressuring and heating may be applied uniformly on the entire surface, thus enabling the lubricant to be smoothly transferred to the printing sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The lubricant contained in the lubricant containing layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is selected in accordance with the same guideline as described above so that silicon oil is again most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The ink ribbon is enclosed in a silicon cassette and handled in this state. The ink ribbon cassette has a pay-out reel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a take-up reel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, on which an ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is wound and which are built in a cassette shell <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The yellow pigment containing layer Y, magenta pigment-containing layer M and the cyan pigment containing layer C are repeatedly formed in parallel on the ink ribbon, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Silicon oil is contained in the cyan pigment containing layer C which is printed for the last time among the three pigment containing layers. With the present ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a ribbon head locating mark <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is provided directly before the first-printed yellow pigment containing layer Y, while color locating marks <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are accorded between the yellow pigment containing layer Y and the magenta pigment containing layer M and between the magenta pigment containing layer M and the cyan pigment containing layer C. </paragraph>

The reel-containing portions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are formed on opposite side thereof with slits <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> a via which is passed the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The pay-out reel <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the take-up reel <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, about which the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is wound, are accommodated in the reel-containing portions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a direction of exposing the pigment-containing layer of the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> via the window of the cassette shell <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, built into the cassette shell <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, is run with the ribbon head locating mark <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> as an index, until the firstly located yellow pigment containing layer Y is exposed via the entire surface of the window <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the cassette shell. The yellow pigment containing layer Y thus exposed via the window <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the printing sheet set in register with the window <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are stacked together and a thermal head is applied to the back surface of the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for thermally transferring the yellow pigment of the yellow pigment containing layer Y onto required portions of the printing sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> After transcription of the yellow pigment in this manner, the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is run, so as to be stacked on the printing sheet, with the color locating mark <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as an index, until the secondly located magenta pigment containing layer M is exposed via the window in its entirety. The magenta pigment of the magenta pigment-containing layer M is thermally transcribed on a required area of the printing sheet by the thermal head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Finally, the ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is run, with the color locating mark <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as an index, until the thirdly located cyan pigment containing layer C is exposed via the window <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in its entirety so as to be stacked on the printing sheet. The cyan pigment of the cyan pigment containing layer C is thermally transcribed on a required area of the printing sheet by the thermal head for completing the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Since the silicon oil is contained in the cyan pigment containing layer C of the present ink ribbon <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the silicon oil, contained in the cyan pigment containing layer C, is transferred to the printing sheet at the time of thermal transfer of the cyan pigment containing C for according lubricity to the printing sheet surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It is seen from Table 1 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> that the transcription efficiency is improved with the use of the acrylic resin for the reception layer (reception layers B, C and D), such that, even with the pressurizing and heating for two minutes, transcription proceeds sufficiently as evidenced by the transcription concentration of not less than 1.55 in terms of D<highlight><subscript>MAX </subscript></highlight>as measured with a Macbeth densitometer. Conversely, with the reception layer A in which only the epoxy resin is used, the transcription concentration falls short with heating and pressuring for two minutes, while sufficient transcription is achieved only with heating and pressuring continuing for longer than three minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The respective reception layers were also checked as to weatherability. For checking weatherability, the mag-cup was crushed to suitable size and ultrasonically washed for ten minutes in pure water and in 99% ethanol for 10 minutes. The mag-cup was then directly immersed in ethanol for one hour and changes in the reception layer were checked. The results are shown in Table 2.

<heading lvl="1">Bonding the Transparent Film </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> After transcription of the image as described above, a transparent film may be bonded to the surface of the reception layer. In such case, an acrylic resin film having a thickness of 5 to 100 &mgr;m, preferably 5 to 20 &mgr;m, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is bonded to the reception layer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and bonded thereto under application of heat and pressure. In the present Example, an acrylic film containing UV ray absorber, manufactured by KANEGAFUCHI KAGAKU KOGYO CO. LTD. was used as the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thermally fused in position at approximately 140&deg; C. for two seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For thermally fusing the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is bonded on the image of the sublimable dye transcribed on the surface of the mag-cup <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For prohibiting the dye from being transferred back to the press used for thermal fusion, a re-transfer prohibiting sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably stacked on the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The mag-cup, thus prepared, with the image transcribed thereon, is significantly improved in weatherability and resistance against solvents and chemicals and is safeguarded against fading or discoloration due to UV rays.

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Although the surface of the mag-cup <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is smoothed for improving the transcription efficiency of the image of the sublimable dye, the surface of the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be embossed by using an embossed re-transfer prohibiting sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> If a support for image transcription having a crease pattern is formed on the mag-cup <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, it is sufficient if a re-transcription prohibitive sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having an embossed pattern corresponding to the desired creased pattern is used and the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is thermally fused via this sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>If it is desired to form a support for image transcription having a meshed pattern on a tile <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, it is sufficient if a re-transcription prohibitive sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having an embossed pattern corresponding to the desired meshed pattern is used and the transparent film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is thermally fused via this sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
