<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for transporting, checking, filling and sealing a bag which is comprised of a bag body that can be spread out to form a rectangular cross section, said bag body being made up of two wider first and two narrower second bag walls, a bag bottom sealing the bag body at the bottom, a bag opening bordering the bag body at the top, and an opened bag seal, whereby the bag seal itself comprises first sealing flaps which are connected to the first bag walls respectively and stick out horizontally from the bag opening outwards, and towards the first bag walls at right angles, second sealing flaps which are connected to the second bag walls respectively and which lie&mdash;especially when folded inwards onto the bag opening&mdash;horizontally so that the first sealing flaps and the second sealing flaps form a frame-shaped sealing collar lying on a horizontal level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The bag is designed in particular to be filled with pulverized filling products. The process of filling pulverized filling products into bags and the subsequent sealing of the bag seals brings to light several problems which will be covered in the following. In this connection, particularly for paper bags, hot melting glue is usually applied to the sealing surfaces for the purpose of sealing, and glued together or, in the case of bags made from thermoplastic foils, sealing surfaces lying on top of each other are thermally welded together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One problem is presented by the formation of dust which is difficult to suppress during the filling process leading to the soiling of the plant and working place stress and even to the risk of dust explosions. This formation of dust must therefore be kept as low as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to keep the formation at a bearable level valve bags are widely used in which a valve sleeve is glued in one end of a cross bottom element. The disadvantage of such bags lies in the reduced filling speed which is limited by the valve cross section in which a filler neck with a diameter of few centimeters is integrated. In addition the manufacturing and recycling is more costly due to the use of additional valve sleeves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When open-mouthed bags are being used the filling speed can be increased however the entire sealing surfaces are dust covered after the filling process so that the sealing is not always effected faultlessly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A second problem lies in the fact that the area of the bag seal is inevitably covered by a layer of dust. A dust covered surface impedes the gluing process using hot melting glues as well as the welding of the surfaces of thermoplastic foils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further problem arises in that bags filled with pulverized filling products which are sealed after the filling process for example by folding over, have micro openings at the folding corners which in turn are connected to the bag interior via channels out of which filling products can spill and through which -insect pests can gain access especially in the case of food stuffs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This being the basis it is the aim of the present invention to provide a method for transporting, testing, filling and sealing a bag which can be conducted with a most extensive suppression of formation of dust and allows a sealing of the bag which is not influenced by the formation of dust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The solution for this lies in the properties of the independent procedure and device claims. These are based on a bag which is comprised of a bag body that can be spread out to form a rectangular cross section, said bag body being made up of two wider first and two narrower second bag walls, a bag bottom sealing the bag body at the bottom, a bag opening bordering the bag body at the top, and an opened bag seal, whereby the bag seal itself comprises first sealing flaps which are connected to the first bag walls respectively and stick out horizontally from the bag opening outwards, and towards the first bag walls at right angles, second sealing flaps which are connected to the second bag walls respectively and which lie&mdash;especially when folded inwards onto the bag opening&mdash;horizontally so that the first sealing flaps and the second sealing flaps form a frame-shaped sealing collar lying on a horizontal level. A preferred embodiment and method for manufacturing such a bag is described in the patent application of Chronos Richardson GmbH lodged at the same time. An essential feature of the aforementioned method is the fact that the first sealing flaps are held in place by propelling conveying means during transport, testing, filling and sealing of the bag so that the bag can be kept suspended freely by these. This applies especially to the filling of the bag. Inside the transport means which is particularly comprised of conveyor belt pairs, guide profiles or guide beads can support the parts of the aforementioned sealing collar which are positioned horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A procedure and a device for testing a bag stands out because of the fact that the flattened bag body is kept in its flattened shape between large-surface air permeated angle brackets and that a pressure joint is tightly put onto the essentially horizontally positioned sealing collar with a clearance to the bag opening whereby compressed air is supplied for test purposes via the bag openings. If an excessive pressure drop occurs at the pressure joint the first sealing flaps will be released by the transport means and the faulty bag is ejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A new method and a special apparatus for filling operations are characterized by a filler neck which has sealing compounds running along the edge of the bag opening enclosing the opening which are placed on the sealing collar being positioned essentially horizontally before the filling products are transferred into the bag. Therefore the sealing collar is kept free of filling products and especially dust for the purpose of a later sealing process. A special procedure and a corresponding apparatus for sealing the filled bag in the first step is characterized in that a cover sheet which is to be glued onto the area previously kept dust free by the filler neck, or welded to the sealing collar, is placed on the essentially horizontal sealing collar. In this connection it is also essential that the sealing collar lies on a plain surface whereby a cover sheet having been placed for example in such a way that it can be unrolled, or in a level configuration, is &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; circumferentially with the dust free area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The final folding of the bag seal can be effected in further steps using further sealing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the following details of the devices and the method according to the invention are described in more detail using the description of embodiments.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a feeder station of an apparatus according to the invention is shown in which a bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is held in a first configuration. This bag comprises a flattened bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whose lower part, in particular its closed bottom part is not illustrated. The bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms a slot-shaped opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the top and on both sides towards the opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are visible strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; which are still part of the bag body. These strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; protrude at a right angles from the flattened bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to both sides. They are limited by a binding edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which lies on a plane forming a rectangle separating the parts of the bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the parts of the bag seal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. This is formed by first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; which are situated outside the binding edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and protrude at a right angles away from the plane of the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;, as well as by second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; which are situated inside the binding edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and are folded onto the plane of the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. Outside the binding edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> final gussets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; which also represent part of the bag body, follow the second seal gussets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;. The parts of the bag seal <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, i.e. the first and second sealing flaps, together form double-layered sealing rails <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; which are limited on the outside by a crease border <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at the crossover of the first seal gussets <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the second seal gussets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. At each of the four corners there are sealing gussets <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and crease borders <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The parts of the feeder station <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be described in the following are just like the parts of the following stations also essentially symmetrical to the plane area defined by the flattened bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are manufactured in double, in particular, with the exception of some functional parts lying above the bag opening. The feeder station <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of guide profiles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime; which support the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bag body by means of upper surface sections. Below the profiles which jointly guide the bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a pair of conveyor belts <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown each consisting of pairs of deflection rollers which are not individually designated and continuous loops which for the deflection rollers vertical axes of rotation affect the bag body below the guide profiles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and enable the feeder process of a bag into the feeder station and the forward feed of a bag out of the feeder station to the following station. In the testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> following the feeder station, a bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with essentially matching configuration to the one in the feeder station is shown however the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are each folded towards the outside into the plane area of the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus a horizontally positioned circumferential sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is created which is formed by the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; and the seal gussets <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> encloses the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime; which is still closed by the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime;. Within this sealing collar both strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; are still lying on both sides of the slot-shaped opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as the final gussets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; outside the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The station comprises angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; made from perforated plates and grills which are in turn positioned in pairs symmetrically such that their horizontal shanks support the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the vertical shanks enclose the flattened bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between each other. The vertical shanks also here are not displayed in their complete form like the bag body. They are however developed downwards to the extent that they support the entire bag body. The transfer of the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from the vertical into the horizontal position can be effected by the stationarily installed deflection shoes which are located between the two stations. The testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> comprises furthermore pairs of conveyor belts on both sides of the angle brackets of which only lower conveyor belts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; respectively are shown which are located directly below the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, whereby the not denoted deflection rollers are arranged on a horizontal axis. In addition to the conveyor belts shown, complementary pairs of conveyor belts situated above have to be assumed which are each placed immediately above the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the pairs of conveyor belts can affect the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; in pairs on both sides of the support profiles in such a way that a bag is fed into and then moved out of the testing station. As an additional element which is not shown here the testing station comprises a pressure joint which has essentially the shape of a cuboid-shaped box open at the bottom, and to which compressed air can be supplied from the rear side. The lower open, rectangular area is equipped with a sealing edge which can be placed along the following filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> according to the line of contact situated inside the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for a filler neck. Once the compressed air supply has ceased the bag is held essentially in shape by the angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Leakages in the bag body would be recognizable by a pressure drop in the pressure joint. In such a case the marginally more movable pressure joint would be raised, and the angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and conveyor belts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> symmetrical to the bag would be separated from each other horizontally, and the respective upper and lower conveyor belts of the pairs of conveyor belts would be separated from each other on both sides in perpendicular direction so that as a result the bag would be discharged downwards from the testing station under the influence of its own weight. A pair of the discharge rollers affecting the bag of which only one discharge roller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is visible, can support this action as an additional safety measure. After the completion of the testing process faultless bags are then transported further towards the indicated filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by means of the conveyor belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown in a modified embodiment in comparison to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> feature transfer sections at their rear ends seen in conveyor direction which separate from each other in a y-shaped manner. The angle brackets are completed by grills which are only indicated under the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the bag and on both sides of the bag body. The conveyor belts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; are situated on both sides of the angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and are provided in double in pairs whereby the axes of their deflection rollers are positioned horizontally. In this respect the arrangement and functionality corresponds to the conveyor belts described in connection with the testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, only the respective lower conveyor belts of the pairs of conveyor belts are shown. The bag has the same configuration as in the testing station according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> therefore the description there is referred to. Details are not denoted here. Above the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which shows a drawn contact and sealing line a pressure joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> shown in an elevated position, with a compressed-air piping. From the position of the sealing line <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> it can be seen that the seals provided at the pressure joint are supported from below, and the pressure joint surrounds the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for the pressure test with a clearance. Subsequent to the testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; a filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is shown in conveyor direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b; </italic></highlight>this station features guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; being separated by a certain clearance which are located immediately inside the conveyor belt pairs <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime; and which have the same clearance from each other as the conveyor belts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; of the testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The conveyor belts are therefore again affecting the first sealing flaps. The guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which are located on the inside of these only support the inner sections of the first sealing flaps. Inside the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bag positioned inside the station a contact line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is drawn which matches the circumferential line of a filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> belonging to filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This filler neck is shown as being away from the sealing collar overly far in a vertical direction while in actual fact only a marginal lifting motion of the filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is possible. In the position designed for the filling process the lower joint edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is also placed onto the contact line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> while the filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is lifted by a small margin from the sealing collar for transport purposes so that a filled bag can be transferred to the following first sealing station <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a further bag can be fed from the testing station <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime;. The filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is only shown in principal and comprises a feeding hopper <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an essentially cuboid-shaped nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> being open above and below whereby flap mechanisms can be positioned between the two parts mentioned. By releasing a filling quantity into the filler neck or from the filler neck/s the slot-shaped opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is opened completely and at the same time first side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second side walls <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are being shaped at the bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whereby the bag body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> takes on a rectangular cross section shape and the bag is fully spread out. On the conveyor belts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> upper conveyor belts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>o </italic></highlight>are partially shown apart from lower conveyor belts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u </italic></highlight>so that it becomes clear here how bag is guided and held between the pairs of conveyor belts. The retention forces of the pairs of conveyor belts are preferable designed in such a way that during and after the filling process the bag can be held suspended freely in the filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, i.e. the bag bottom does not need to be supported. This offers the advantage that bags of different lengths can be filled in the same filling station. Within the contact edge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which places itself onto the contact line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the sealing collar, the nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> features a sealing edge being separated from it by a certain clearance, which is placed on a sealing line immediately at the opening edge of the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thereby it is ensured that the area of the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the contact line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is kept free from filling products during the filling process, i.e. particularly free from the formation of dust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Following the filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> a first sealing station <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is shown in conveyor direction which features guide beads <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime; and pairs of conveyor belts <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>&prime; in the same configuration as in the filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. On the conveyor belts <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> upper conveyor belts <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>o </italic></highlight>partially working together with lower conveyor belts <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u </italic></highlight>are also shown here. A cover sheet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is placed onto the bag opening, on which a sealing edge <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is marked which essentially comprises the area previously kept free from dust, between the sealing edge on the bag opening and the contact line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. After the first sealing station <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> a second sealing station can follow whereby deflection shoes can be provided between the sealing stations which can transfer the sealing flaps into the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and can even fold these on top of each other subsequent to a gluing process, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a cross section through the testing station is shown while the bag is still flattened as is the case for testing. The pairs of angle brackets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; and the pairs of conveyor belts <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>o, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>o, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>u </italic></highlight>are visible as components of the testing station already mentioned previously. The angle brackets support with their upper shanks the inner parts of the first sealing flaps and the strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the bag body. The vertical shanks of the angle brackets hold the bag body close together. From the pressure joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> first longitudinal seals <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> being positioned along the contact and sealing line are visible which therefore lie in the approximate center on the sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; which continue until between the conveyor belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>an longitudinal section through a bag in the testing station is shown whereby the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; pointing inwards are cut. At the pressure joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> longitudinal seals <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; are visible which are located immediately inside the contact and sealing edge of the pressure joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> both support elements <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; belonging to a filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> together with the respectively associated lifting and pivot pins <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; are shown with respect to the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of a bag shown broken off and which is inside the station in different positions. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) the cut through support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of half-washer shape is situated above the sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and above the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) the support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is lowered in such a way that the cut through support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of half-washer is positioned lower than the level of the sealing collar <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, i.e. with its upper side in the plane area spread out by the guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;. By turning the support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by 180&deg; after lowering it, it is shifted under one of the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Although the bag is shown here in its already completely opened position the positioning of the support elements by lowering and turning by 180&deg; has already been effected in the configuration, shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the bag, in which the bag is transferred to the filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; are thereby only being pushed slightly downwards without incidentally changing the shape of the bag essentially. Onto the cross web <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) a seal edge is lowered from above to come in contact with the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> situated in between. The embodiment in half-washer shape allows it to be screwed in from the position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to the support position according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). However, for the appropriate blade-shaped embodiment the lowering and horizontal shifting motion of a support element is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a cross section through the filling station is shown for a bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> already completely spread out as it is shaped during the filling process. The pairs of guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; and the pairs of conveyor belts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>o, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>o, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>u </italic></highlight>are visible as components of the filling station already mentioned previously. The guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> support with their upper shanks the inner parts of the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. The conveyor belts <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> press and hold the outer areas of the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. From the filler neck <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> the essentially parallel sided nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> with its contact edge is visible. In cut-away areas, longitudinal seals <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which position themselves on the areas of the sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; being supported by the guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, are shown located immediately next to the edge of the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The parts of the first sealing flaps are therefore sealed against admission of filling products during the filling process. The nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is double-walled as shown so that the free inner cross section of the nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> corresponds to the cross section of the bag opening. Furthermore the support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> with the trunnion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown in the position lowered underneath the second sealing flap as known from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) whereby the surface lies on the same level as the surface of the guide profile <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) a longitudinal section through a bag is shown in the filling position whereby the double-walled nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as well as the bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the inwardly pointing second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; can be seen. On the double-walled nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> transverse seals <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>&prime; are visible which run immediately outside and essentially parallel to the edge of the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In the left half of the drawing the support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is shown in the position known and described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in which it supports the sealing flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from below against the nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> pressed on from above. In the right half of the drawing, the support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; is shown in the position known and described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in which it is guided out of the bag area due to a rotating action of 180&deg; and lifting of the trunnion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. By lifting the nozzle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> marginally the bag can be transported further. The area of the sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> lying outside the seals <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>&prime; is again being kept free from filling products, i.e. in particular is dustfree. The transverse seals <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> connect to the longitudinal seals <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> such that a circumferential sealing line is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> further details from the area of a filling station <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are shown whereby for orientation purposes only the guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; are shown not however the pairs of conveyor lying sideways outside the guide profiles. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a bag is shown in a configuration as it is fed into the filling station, i.e. in particular with bag walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; lying closely together, so that the body is flattened. The first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; are supported from below by the guide profiles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;. The areas of the sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; protruding beyond are retained by the conveyor belts not shown here. Beneath the visible second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> a support element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&Prime; is shown whose underside is preferably slightly conically truncated. The strips <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bag body which are essentially still located on the level of the sealing collar are thereby slightly pushed in whereby they are supported from below by deflectors <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> being arranged in pairs. The deflectors <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; feature a rotatable bearing arrangement around trunnions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>&prime; with horizontal rotational axes running in the direction of the guide profiles <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The movement of the deflectors is dampened by the damper <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>&prime; which act upon the free ends of the deflectors by means of their piston rod <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>&prime; via pivot pins <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>&prime;, and which feature a swiveling bearing arrangement using pivot pins <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>&prime;. If the entire filling quantity is released into the feeding hopper in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and falls onto the wall sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; no tearing or destructive action can occur due to the support shown by means of the deflectors because the impact of the filling quantity is first of all captured by the deflectors <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>&prime; softly giving way so that the filling product can only increasingly spread out the bag in a controlled fashion from top to bottom until the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is reached. For this the deflectors are perpendicular and lie parallel to the first bag walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. The filled bag can be transported further from this position towards a sealing station. A further bag which is still flattened can then be fed in. Afterwards the deflectors must again be returned to their original position by means of the damping elements <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, as well as the support elements <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> previously pulled back which must again be guided into the bag opening and positioned underneath the second sealing flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7 a</cross-reference> sheet stack <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of cover sheets is shown in a) of which a first cover sheet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is indicated in a lifted off position. Above the sheet stack <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> a holding frame <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is shown which can lift off a cover sheet and shift it sideways into a position in which a glue application can be carried out onto the cover sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In b) a station with a double jet <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and a single cover sheet which has glue on its underside is shown. The holding frame <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> can hold the cover sheet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the position shown. The double jet <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be guided in a rectangle along the edges of the cover sheet if its longitudinal axis is kept parallel to it, thereby creating first glue beads <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal edges and double-layered glue beads <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> along the traverse edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In c) a sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown which respectively form dual fold sealing corners <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the corners. The sealing collar <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> encloses the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the filled bag. With a slight clearance to the edge of the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the sealing line <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is drawn in, outside which the sealing collar is kept dustfree during the bag filling process. Already during the manufacturing process of the bag sealing rails folded in double at the cut are placed on the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> whose crease edge runs along the inside of the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and which open to the outside in a V shape. A lower strip of these sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is glued or welded to the corresponding second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an upper strip is placed against the crease edge and can be swung out opposite the lower strip. It can be seen that the essential part of these sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> lies outside the sealing line <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and is therefore kept dustfree during the bag filling process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In d) it can be seen that the cover sheet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is placed onto the bag opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The first glue beads <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> are essentially glued to the first sealing flaps <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The second glue beads <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are glued to the upper strips of the sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Outside the sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> the second glue beads <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are immediately connected to the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In e) a vertical cross section through a bag is shown for which the cross section is carried out in lengthwise direction of the bag opening and the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are folded inwards onto the bag body. Near the bag opening the twofold sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are indicated. First spline tools <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> can drive under the swung open upper strips of the sealing rails <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as shown in the left drawing, whereas upper spline tools <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which are especially shaped at the lower holding frame <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, can press the cover sheet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which is put on against them for gluing together the first glue bead <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. In order to press the second glue bead <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> to the second sealing flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the first spline tool <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> must pulled back. </paragraph>
