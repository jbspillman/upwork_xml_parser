<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to techniques for printing digital images and, more particularly, to techniques for printing remote images using a printer having communication capabilities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web (the &ldquo;Web&rdquo;), is increasingly being used to store and exchange information and to perform commercial transactions. Although the Web was originally only capable of storing and displaying textual information, the Web may now be used to store, display, and exchange a wide variety of textual, graphical, and audiovisual information such as digital images and full-motion video. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Digital photography, for example, is becoming increasingly popular, spurred in large part by the advent of low-cost, high-quality digital cameras. An increasing number of web sites allow users to upload digital photographs and other digital images to the Web, whereby such images may subsequently be viewed, shared, edited, and printed on conventional printers using computers connected to the Web using conventional Internet connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To print a digital image from the Web, a user must typically use a conventional desktop or laptop computer to establish a Web connection using a conventional modem or other network connection device. The user must then locate the digital image (such as a digital photograph) to be printed or complete a transaction that produces an image (such as a ticket) to be printed. The user must then typically download the located image from the Web site to the computer. To print the image, the user must typically issue a &ldquo;print&rdquo; command to the Web browser or other software executing on the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Such a process can be cumbersome for the user and may restrict the range of circumstances in which the user may print digital images from the Web. For example, the conventional method described above involves several discrete steps, each of which must be initiated by the user: locating the desired image, downloading the image to a host computer, and issuing a print command to print the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Locating the desired image may be difficult if the user does not know or remember the precise Web address of the image to be printed. Even if the user does remember, for example the address of the home page of the Web site on which the image is stored, it may be necessary for the user to perform several steps to navigate a Web browser to the precise image to be downloaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If the image to be printed cannot be printed directly from the Web page on which it is stored, it may be necessary for the user to download the image to the host computer. This may require the user to perform several steps, such as selecting the image, providing a filename for the image, and selecting a location on a local storage device (such as a hard disk drive) in which the image is to be stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Printing the image may also be problematic. For example, if the image has been downloaded to a local storage device, the user may have to locate the image on the storage device and open the image file using imaging software before issuing a print command. The print command may fail for a variety of reasons, such as a faulty connection between the host computer and the printer or the absence of an appropriate printer driver on the host computer. After printing the image, the user typically must manually delete the downloaded image file from the local storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In particular, it may be difficult and/or time consuming for a user to print images that are generated as a result of a non-Web transaction. Consider, for example, a user who purchases a ticket (such as a concert ticket or airline ticket) over the telephone. If such a transaction generates a ticket that is accessible over the Web for printing, the conventional system described above would require the user to connect the host computer to the Web, locate the image of the ticket using a Web browser, and print the image. Such a process requires the user to engage in a significant amount of post-transaction activity and may be particularly difficult for those users who have chosen to conduct the transaction (e.g., purchase the ticket) over the telephone because they are not familiar with using computers in general or the Web in particular. Users who are unable to print the resulting ticket may become dissatisfied with the associated service and fail to become repeat customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It should therefore be apparent that the process of printing images from the Web using a conventional computer connected to a conventional printer can be a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the requirement that the printer be connected to a host computer has a variety of disadvantages. For example, a mobile computer user who desires the ability to print images from a variety of locations (such as at home and at the office) must have access to a Web-connected computer in each such location. Using the techniques described above, even a small mobile printer must be connected to a computer to print images from the Web. As a result, a user who wishes to print such remote images may be required to travel with both a printer and a laptop computer, or may be limited to printing images from locations at which a Web-connected desktop computer is available. The requirement that the printer be connected to a computer therefore limits the mobility of the user and limits the range of locations from which images may be remotely printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> What is needed, therefore, are improved techniques for downloading and printing digital images. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Techniques are disclosed for coupling a printer to a communications network (such as a Plain Old Telephone Service network or wireless voice or data networks), downloading printing information (such as a digital image) to the printer over the communications network, and using the printer to print output based on the printing information. Downloads may be interrupted and subsequently resumed from the point of interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The printer includes a network communications device, such as a modem, that enables the printer to connect directly to the communications network. The printing information may be downloaded to the printer in any of a variety of ways. For example, the printer may establish a connection to a printing server that serves the printing information. A connection between the printer and the printing server may be established, for example, by using the printer to place a telephone call to the printing server over a Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) network. The printer may then download the printing information over the POTS network and print the image specified by the printing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the printing information may have previously been generated in any of a variety of ways. For example, as described in more detail in the above-referenced application entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer,&rdquo; the user may have previously conducted a transaction with a transaction server. The transaction may, for example, be a transaction for requesting or purchasing items such as tickets, maps, brochures, coupons, photographs, menus, or schedules or audiovisual information. Upon completion of the transaction, the transaction server may communicate with the printing server described above to produce the printing information to be printed (such as a digital image of the purchased item). The printing information may be transmitted to the printer by, for example, the printing server or the transaction server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Prior to transmission of the printing information to the printer, the printing server may process the printing information to tailor the printing information based on the capabilities of the printer. For example, the printing server may tailor the printing information to comport with the resolution and/or color depth at which the printer is capable of printing. The printer may, for example, transmit information descriptive of its capabilities to the printing server over any of the connections described above at any appropriate time. Additional details about ways in which the printing server may processing the printing information are contained in the above-referenced application entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The printing server and/or the transaction server may communicate with the printer using one or more printing protocols for communicating over the connections described above. The printer may be equipped with a controller implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof for communicating according to the printing protocol through a port on the printer that is coupled to the communications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, in the transaction server, the printing information (or the output information) is converted into a data structure that is designed to facilitate the printing (outputting) of the information. The information in the data structure format is then transmitted to the printing server. Once received at the printing server, the data in the data structure is processed, rearranged and converted into a form suitable for output. The processed, rearranged and converted information is then provided to the printer (output device) over a network (where the network can be a POTS network or a wireless voice or data network). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although the printer is described herein as a device for printing images, it should be appreciated that more generally the term &ldquo;printer&rdquo; is used herein to refer to any device for receiving input and producing output. Such input/output may include not only static images but also an audiovisual stream (which may include an audio stream, a video stream, or any combination thereof). It should therefore be appreciated that the term &ldquo;image&rdquo; (when referring, for example, to stored images and a printed image) may refer not only to a static image, but to any of the kinds of information that the printer may receive and output. The printer may, for example, be a CD drive (such as a CD-ROM, CD-R, or CD-RW drive), DVD player, or MP3 player that includes a network communications device and performs the other functions of the printer that are described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Additional aspects and embodiments of the present invention and advantages thereof will be described in more detailed below.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, techniques are provided for enabling a printer to download an image directly over a communications network (such as a Plain Old Telephone Service network or a wireless voice or data network), and for printing the downloaded image using the printer. The image may be downloaded over the communications network to the printer without using a host computer (such as a desktop or laptop computer) as an intermediary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown which may be used in one embodiment of the present invention to download a selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from an image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and to print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is connected directly to a communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through a data port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, without the use of an intermediate host computer. To enable the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to establish a connection over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may, for example, be equipped with an internal network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (such as a modem or network interface card) having an external data port <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Operation of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is now described in more detail. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> serves a plurality of stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is accessible over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is a web server that hosts a web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through which stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be accessed. In such an embodiment, image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may provide a convenient user interface through which users may upload, download, and view stored images. Examples of techniques for uploading images to such a web server are described in more detail in the co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/870,536, filed May 30, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Method and System for Remote Utilizing a Mobile Device to Share Data Objects.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a separate application server (not shown) provides the primary content and functionality of web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for uploading, downloading, and viewing stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The application server may also manage other information such as user profiles and user usage statistics. In such an embodiment, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may perform the limited tasks of storing and retrieving stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as instructed by the application server. As a result, in such an embodiment the combination of the application server and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provide a coherent user experience in which the user may upload, download, and view stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The functions performed by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be further subdivided into additional servers and/or applications as may be convenient for a particular purpose. It should be appreciated, therefore, that the single image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is described herein as performing all functions related to web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> merely for ease of illustration and explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To download a selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from among the stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a connection is first established between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Either the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may initiate the connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For example, consider one embodiment in which the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) network and the network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is a modem. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may initiate a connection with the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over the POTS network by dialing a predetermined telephone number associated with the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be equipped with a corresponding modem that answers the telephone call placed by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may then negotiate and establish a connection over the POTS network in any of a variety of ways that are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may call a predetermined toll-free telephone number to connect to a computer that may provide the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with a telephone number or other address of the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Techniques for locating the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in this manner are described in more detail in the copending application Ser. No. 09/842,754, filed Apr. 26, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Remote Processing and Sharing of Digital Images,&rdquo; hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may initiate a connection with the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the POTS network by dialing a predetermined telephone number associated with the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (in this case, a modem) inside the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may answer the telephone call placed by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may then negotiate and establish a connection over the POTS network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The connection between the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be initiated in response to any of a variety of events. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the user may press a &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button on the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to instruct the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to establish a connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and to download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is designed to dial a telephone number associated with the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> when the &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button is pressed, thereby initiating a connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the connection between the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be establish through a wireless data network or a wireless communications network as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/870,538. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once a connection is established between the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may download the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> over the established connection. Image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may communicate with each other using messages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> transmitted over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As described in more detail below, messages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be defined in accordance with an image printing protocol designed to facilitate performance of functions such as downloading the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the download of the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the printer is interrupted, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may terminate its connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. For example, if the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is connected to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over a POTS telephone line that has call waiting enabled, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may terminate its connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in response to receipt of an incoming call on the telephone call during a download. The user may then answer the phone and engage in a voice telephone call over the telephone line. A connection between the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be re-established upon termination of the voice telephone call to complete the download of the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the printer. Techniques for performing such interruption and resumption of downloads are described in more detail in the co-pending application Ser. No. 09/842,754, filed on Apr. 26, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Remote Processing and Sharing of Digital Images.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described in more detail in the above-referenced application entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer,&rdquo; the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may perform various kinds of processing on the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to produce a processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may then transmit the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, rather than the original selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. It should therefore be appreciated that any references herein to downloading of the selected image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may be understood to refer to the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in cases where the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and that any references herein to downloading of the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may be understood to refer to the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in cases where the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> does not perform any processing on the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Once the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has downloaded the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may print the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on an output medium (such as plain paper) using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring now to data flow diagram <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an example of a process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that may be used to download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is now described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates actions performed and messages transmitted by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. More specifically, diagram <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes two columns, corresponding to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, respectively. An action performed by one of these components is indicated by a rectangle in the corresponding column, and a message transmitted by the component is indicated by a non-rectangular parallelogram in the corresponding column. A message transmitted by a first component to a second component is indicated by a parallelogram describing the message in the first component&apos;s column, connected to an arrow ending in the second component&apos;s column. Diagram <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a time axis which runs downward, indicating the sequence in which actions are performed and messages are transmitted. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> below will further clarify the diagram <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Prior to initiation of the process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> user has selected the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The user may select the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by, for example, using a web browser <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> executing on the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to browse to a web page in web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through which the stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> served by image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be accessed. The web page may, for example, be a web page having a user interface that simulates a page of a photo album. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described in more detail in the co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/870,536, filed May 30, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Method and System for Remote Utilizing a Mobile Device to Share Data Objects,&rdquo; users may create an account on the web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. When a user creates such an account, information about the user, such as the user&apos;s login name, password, and cell telephone number (obtained using caller ID), are recorded by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a database. Creation of such an account enables personalization of features provided by web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, such as creation of personalized photo albums to which the user&apos;s digital photographs may be uploaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Upon navigating to the web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the user may log in to his account using the web browser <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may then display a personalized web page to the user, such as by displaying the user&apos;s personalized photo album to the user. For example, the stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be divided into directories corresponding to different user accounts and/or different photo albums. If the user has not previously created an account, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may prompt the user to create a new account. It should be appreciated that the use of user accounts is described herein merely for purposes of example and does not constitute a limitation of the present invention. Rather, printing and downloading of images may be performed without the creation or use of user accounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After browsing to the web page containing the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user may select the image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for printing. The selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be any of the stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The user may perform such a selection by, for example, clicking on a thumbnail of the image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The user may then issue a &ldquo;print&rdquo; command to print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The user may issue such a command by, for example, clicking on a &ldquo;print&rdquo; button on the web page containing the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The print command may be transmitted by the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> using techniques that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In response to receipt of the &ldquo;print&rdquo; command (step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extracts the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) and optionally processes the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to generate processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may, for example, maintain an individualized print queue (not shown) for each user who has an account on the web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. After generating the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may add the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to an individualized print queue associated with the current user. If, as described above, the user selected the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> while logged in to the user&apos;s account on the web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may use the user&apos;s account information (e.g., the user&apos;s login name) to identify the individualized print queue that is associated with the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> next initiates a connection to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may initiate this connection in any of a variety of ways. For example, if the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a POTS network, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may initiate a connection to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by placing a telephone call to the printer&apos;s network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (in this case, a modem). If, as described above, the user selected the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> while logged in to the user&apos;s account on the web site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may obtain the telephone number for the network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> from the user&apos;s account information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After initiating a connection to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> transmits the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (and, if applicable, any other images that are in the user&apos;s individualized print queue) to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using the image printing protocol (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). Printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> then prints the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the techniques described above have a variety of advantages. For example, it is not required that printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> be connected to image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through an intermediate computer, such as host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The ability to connect the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> directly to the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> without the use of an intermediate host computer increases the user&apos;s mobility when printing, particularly if the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is a portable printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring now to data flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an example of another process <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that may be used to download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> using the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is now described. Prior to initiation of the process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> user has selected the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> After selecting the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user may issue a &ldquo;print&rdquo; command to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may, for example, be equipped with a &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button that the user may press to instruct the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In response to receipt of the &ldquo;print&rdquo; command (step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>), the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> initiates a connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using any of the techniques described above. If, for example, the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a POTS network, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may place a telephone call to the server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over the POTS network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using the network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (in this case, a modem) to initiate a connection to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may obtain the telephone number for the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in any of a variety of ways. For example, upon pressing the printer&apos;s &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may prompt the user for the image server&apos;s telephone number, which the user may then enter through a keypad on the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, for example, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may allow the user to pre-configure the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with the telephone number or Internet address of the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may automatically connect to the image server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> without having to prompt the user for such information each time the printer&apos;s &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button is pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Once a connection between the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is established, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extracts the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) and optionally processes the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to generate processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that was previously selected by the user in any of a variety of ways. For example, as described in more detail in the above-referenced application entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer,&rdquo; the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may use caller ID messages (not shown) to identify the telephone number associated with the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may then identify the user&apos;s account based on the identified telephone number. The user&apos;s account may store a record of the particular image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that was previously selected by the user for printing. Alternatively, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may store and transmit information about the user, such as the user&apos;s login name and password, to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the particular image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that was previously selected by the user for printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For example, as described above, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may maintain individualized print queue for different users. When a user selects an image for printing, or otherwise generates an image to print, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the user&apos;s individualized print queue and add the image to the identified print queue. When a connection is subsequently established between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for purposes of printing one or more images, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the particular print queue from which images are to be printed in any of a variety of ways. For example, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may have a unique serial number. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with a particular user by storing the printer&apos;s serial number with the user&apos;s account information. Upon the establishment of a connection between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may transmit its serial number to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, whereby the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify the user&mdash;and thereby the individualized print queue that is associated with the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may use caller ID messages <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to identify the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and thereby to identify the user and individualized print queue that is associated with the print queue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After extracting the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and performing any processing to generate processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> transmits the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (and, if applicable, any other images that are in the user&apos;s individualized print queue) to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using the image printing protocol (step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). Printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> then prints the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/870,538, the user could utilize a printer and a model device to download and print a selected image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the techniques described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> have a variety of advantages. For example, the user may select selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for printing and cause the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be printed simply by pressing a &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button on printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A connection is then automatically established between printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> then downloads and prints selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without requiring the subsequent involvement of the user. This process is much simpler from the user&apos;s point of view than the conventional process in which the user must manually download the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a local storage device, locate the downloaded image, print it, and then delete the selected image from the local storage device. The process shown and described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> instead allows the user to simply select an image and hit the printer&apos;s &ldquo;Print&rdquo; button to print it. Furthermore, since is not required that printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> be connected to image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through an intermediate computer, such as host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the user may select the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at one time and location using the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and subsequently print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at a different time and location using the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> even if the host computer is no longer accessible or available. The ability to connect the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> directly to the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> without the use of an intermediate host computer increases the user&apos;s mobility when printing, particularly if the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is a portable printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated, however, that the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be used to send the &ldquo;print&rdquo; command to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). For example, upon selecting the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the user may issue a &ldquo;print&rdquo; command using the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In response, the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may transmit a &ldquo;print&rdquo; command to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over a connection such as a parallel or serial cable, instructing the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;print&rdquo; command transmitted by the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may include a variety of information&mdash;such as the telephone number or Internet address of the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the Internet address of the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the user name and password of the user&mdash;to enable the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to successfully download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In response to receiving the &ldquo;print&rdquo; command from the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, however, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may download and print the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without the subsequent involvement of the host computer, as described above with respect to steps <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments described above, the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is one of a plurality of stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as digital photographs, served by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated, however, that the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be generated and stored in any manner prior to being downloaded and printed by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In other words, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is not limited to downloading and printing any particular kind of information or to printing information that has been generated in any particular manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in one aspect of the present invention, techniques are provided for using the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to print a transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> associated with a transaction. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> data flow diagram of a process <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that may be used to download and print the transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> using the system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A user may use a telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to place a telephone call to a transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> over communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). The communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a POTS network. Alternatively, and as described in more detail in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/870,538, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer,&rdquo; the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may be a cellular telephone and the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be a cellular voice or data network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be any transaction server, such as a service for purchasing event tickets or a service for requesting and/or purchasing information, such as maps, brochures, coupons, photographs, menus, or schedules or audiovisual information. The user completes a transaction (such as purchasing a ticket) with transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> using a user interface provided by the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the transaction, transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> transmits a transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>). Transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be any image associated with the transaction, such as an image of the ticket purchased by the user. Transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may transmit transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over any network <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>),such as the Internet, and using any protocol. Transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may also transmit other information about the transaction (not shown) to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to enable the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to identify the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and/or the user of the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. For example, the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may transmit the telephone number of the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, as obtained using caller ID messages (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After completing the transaction with transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may process the transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to produce processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>). The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may process transaction image <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> in any of a variety of ways, as described above with respect to processing of the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As described in detail in the above-referenced application entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer,&rdquo; the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may identify features of the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and process the selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so that processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is suitable for printing by printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> then initiates a connection to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using any of the techniques described elsewhere herein (step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). It should be appreciated that the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may communicate with each other over a different network than that used by the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to communicate with each other. For example, the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may communicate with the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> over a wireless voice network, and the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may communicate with each other over a POTS network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Upon initiation of the connection between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> transfers the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (and, if applicable, any other images in the user&apos;s individualized print queue) to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>), which may then print printed image <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>). Image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may communicate with each other over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using image protocol messages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As described above with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment of the present invention, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be used by the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for the image processing and printing capabilities provided by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The particular example illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is only one example of a manner in which the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be used, and does not constitute a limitation of the present invention. More generally, capabilities of the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&mdash;such as the ability to produce processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in accordance with particular capabilities of the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the ability to transmit processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for printing over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&mdash;may be used by other services in a variety of ways. Examples of such techniques are described in more detail in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/870,538, entitled &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Printing Remote Images Using a Mobile Device and Printer.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The image printing protocol may define any of a variety of messages for enabling communication between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment, the image printing protocol defines messages including the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> INIT. This message is transmitted from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to notify the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is requesting the initiation of communication between the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may, for example, transmit this message in response to receipt of the &ldquo;print&rdquo; command from the user (e.g., after step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> REQUEST_SPECS. This message is transmitted from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to request information about the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The manner in which this information may be used is described in more detail above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> TRANSMIT_SPECS. This message is transmitted from the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in response to the REQUEST_SPECS message. Included in the message are the specifications requested by the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> TRANSMIT_IMAGE. This message is transmitted from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The message includes the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to be printed. The TRANSMIT_IMAGE message may, for example, be used to implement step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> END. This message is transmitted from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at the conclusion of transmission of the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (e.g., after step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). After receipt of the END command from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may print the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (e.g., step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that messages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> defined by the image printing protocol (such as the examples provided in the list above) may be encoded in any manner. It should be further appreciated that particular implementations of the image printing protocol may involve additional messages not shown here. For example, messages transmitted by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (such as the INIT command) may have-corresponding acknowledgement (ACK) messages which are transmitted in response by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as a method of handshaking. As another example, the TRANSMIT_IMAGE message may be transmitted from the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as a plurality of messages, each of which contains a portion of the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The image printing protocol may also include provisions for error detection and/or correction. Such implementation details of particular embodiments of the image printing protocol are not described here for simplicity of explanation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a system for enabling the printing of images from an image server using a network enabled printer where the images are transaction images associated with a transaction is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the printing information (or the output information) is converted into a data structure that is designed to facilitate the printing (outputting) of the information. One embodiment of the data structure designed to facilitate printing is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ (Atty. Docket No. 8524), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The information in the data structure format is then transmitted over network <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to the image (output or printing) server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Once received at the image (output or printing) server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the data in the data structure is processed, rearranged and converted into a form suitable for output. One embodiment of method of rearranging and converting the data in the data structure and into a form suitable for printing (output) is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/067,442 Atty. Docket No. 8528), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The processed, rearranged and converted information is then provided to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (output device) over the network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (where the network can be a POTS network or a wireless voice or data network). One embodiment of a protocol for communicating between printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ (Atty. Docket No. 8532), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the various embodiments described above are provided merely for purposes of example and do not constitute limitations of the present invention. Rather, various other embodiments are also within the scope of the claims, such as the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is described herein as performing various functions, such as communicating in accordance with the image printing protocol and printing the printed image <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. It should be appreciated that such functionality may be implemented within the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in any manner, such as by using hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. In general, a printer &ldquo;controller&rdquo; refers herein generally to any such subsystem(s) of the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that perform the functions described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Although the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is described herein as a device for printing images, it should be appreciated that more generally the term &ldquo;printer&rdquo; is used herein to refer to any device for receiving input and producing output. Such input/output may include not only static images but also an audiovisual stream (which may include an audio stream, a video stream, or any combination thereof). It should therefore be appreciated that the term &ldquo;image&rdquo; (when referring, for example, to the stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the printed image <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>) may refer not only to a static image, but to any of the kinds of information that the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may receive and output. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a CD drive (such as a CD-ROM, CD-R, or CD-RW drive), DVD player, or MP3 player that includes the network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and performs the other functions of the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that are described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be any device that is capable of establishing a connection to the Internet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For example, the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be a conventional desktop or laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or Internet appliance. A user of the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may establish a connection between the host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the Internet using techniques that are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may connect to the Internet or other network using any suitable network connection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is described herein as an &ldquo;image server,&rdquo; it should be appreciated that more generally the server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is a printing server that may serve any kind of information&mdash;referred to herein as &ldquo;printing information&rdquo; suitable for transmission to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Similarly, stored images <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may contain information other than images, and selected image <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be information other than images. As used herein, the term &ldquo;printing information&rdquo; refers to information including but not limited to images, text, audiovisual streams, web pages, and any combination thereof. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may further process the printing information that it receives (such as processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) to produce printed image <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> used by the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may be any communications device, such as a conventional analog modem, cable modem, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modem, or network interface card (NIC). The network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> may be either internal to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or external to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, as long as the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes a controller suitable for using the network communications device <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to communicate over the communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be any network or combination of networks. For example, the communications network may be a POTS network, wireless network, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or an internet such as the public Internet. The printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, host computer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> need not all communicate over the same network. For example, the telephone <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> may communicate with the transaction server <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> over a wireless network, while the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may communicate with the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> over a POTS network. The single communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference> merely for ease of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the term &ldquo;connection&rdquo; as used herein (e.g., a connection between printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) refers to any kind of connection that enables communication between or among two or more devices. For example, a &ldquo;connection&rdquo; may be a physical and/or logical connection enabled by any combination of wired and/or wireless networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Although the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is described above as transmitting the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> directly to the printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may transmit the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the transaction server <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, which may in turn transmit the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> over communications network <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The transaction server <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may communicate with printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> using the image printing protocol described above. As a result, the user may interact solely with the user interface provided by the transaction server&apos;s web site, and the capabilities (e.g., generation of the processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) provided by the image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be provided transparently, without any interaction by or knowledge of the user. The image server <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may therefore act as an application service that is used by the transaction server <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to produce processed image <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in a format that is suitable for printing by printer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Although examples are provided above in which images are printed in response to actions performed by the user, this is not a limitation of the present invention. Rather, images may be automatically printed without any prompting by the user. For example, a coupon or advertisement may be automatically printed when a user navigates to a particular web site, without the initiation of any particular action by the user at that web site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In general, the techniques described above may be implemented, for example, in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. The techniques described above may be implemented in one or more computer programs executing on a programmable computer including a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including, for example, volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. Program code may be applied to data entered using the input device to perform the functions described and to generate output information. The output information may be applied to one or more output devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Elements and components described herein may be further divided into additional components or joined together to form fewer components for performing the same functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Each computer program within the scope of the claims below may be implemented in any programming language, such as assembly language, machine language, a high-level procedural programming language, or an object-oriented programming language. The programming language may be a compiled or interpreted programming language. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Each computer program may be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device for execution by a computer processor. Method steps of the invention may be performed by a computer processor executing a program tangibly embodied on a computer-readable medium to perform functions of the invention by operating on input and generating output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that although the invention has been described above in terms of particular embodiments, the foregoing embodiments are provided as illustrative only, and do not limit or define the scope of the invention.
