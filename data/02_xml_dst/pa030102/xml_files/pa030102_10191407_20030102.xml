A sensor adjusting circuit for adjusting an analog input signal inputted from a sensor and outputting it as another analog output signal in accordance with a physical quantity to be sensed, comprises: a first analog-to-digital converter having an analog integrator (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for integrating the analog input signal, a comparator (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) for comparing an output of the analog integrator with a predetermined value, and a D/A converter (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) for outputting an output of the comparator as the input signal; and a second digital-to-analog converter (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) for converting the output of the comparator and outputting it as the analog output signal. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a circuit which is assembled in each of various sensors for sensing a physical quantity as an electric signal and processes the output signal and, more particularly, to a sensor adjusting circuit suitable for use in a capacitive acceleration sensor or a hot-wire air flow sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a sensor such as a capacitive acceleration sensor for sensing a physical quantity as an electric signal, it is necessary to adjust so that the scale of the physical quantity to be sensed and the scale of the output signal have a desired relation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A process necessary for satisfying the desired relation is called scale adjustment (calibration) and a circuit assembled in a sensor for the process is a sensor adjusting circuit. Plainly speaking, the sensor adjusting circuit is nothing but a converting circuit for giving predetermined input/output characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The contents of the process carried out by the sensor adjusting circuit are generally span adjustment and offset adjustment. In this case, the span adjustment corresponds to sensitivity adjustment, and the offset adjustment corresponds to zero point adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A sensor adjusting circuit which uses a memory in which data necessary to be outputted is stored in a predetermined address and makes the address of the memory correspond to the level of an input signal, thereby outputting data to be read out as an output signal is conventional employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 3-51714 discloses a PROM (programmable read only memory) of a Zener zapping system and a method of selecting a leading part of a resistor array in accordance with the contents of data of the PROM, thereby adjusting a sensor output. There is disclosed another method of adjusting an sensor output by changing a circuit constant of a switched capacitor circuit on the basis of information written in the PROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-62010, a method of adjusting a sensor output by using an A/D converter (analog-to-digital converter) and a CPU (central processing unit) is proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As will be described hereinbelow, some of the conventional techniques do not consider limitation of expansion of the adjustment range and improvement in the accuracy. The other conventional technique does not consider that suppression of increase in the circuit scale is limited and has a problem with improvement of the cost performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With respect to the conventional techniques such as the method of selecting the leading part of the resistor array and the method of changing the circuit constant of the switched capacitor circuit, the circuit structure is easily formed on a chip. When expansion of the adjustment range and increase in accuracy are attempted, however, exponential increase in the circuit scale is accompanied so that the expansion of the adjustment range and the increase in accuracy are limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As for the conventional technique of the method using the A/D converter and the CPU, the expansion of the adjustment range and the increase in accuracy can be relatively easily realized. When general A/D converter and CPU are used, however, there is an overlapped function part (overhang). Consequently, an unused part in the circuit is large, the circuit scale is increased due to the unused part, and the suppression of increase in the circuit scale is therefore limited. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a first object of the invention to provide a sensor adjusting circuit which can easily obtain a wide adjustment range and high accuracy with a small circuit scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a second object of the invention to provide a signal generating circuit for sensor output adjustment which does not have a functional overhang part and has a sufficiently small circuit scale while maintaining the wide adjustment range and high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The first object is achieved by a sensor adjusting circuit comprising an analog-to-digital converter, an operational unit for processing an output of the analog-to-digital converter by a prestored program, and a writable memory for holding data for adjustment, wherein the analog-to-digital converter is constructed by an oversampling analog-to-digital converter comprising an analog integrator, a comparing circuit, and a digital-to-analog converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By using the oversampling analog-to-digital converter, the number of bits of a digital signal necessary for holding the adjustment range and the accuracy can be reduced. Thus, the circuit scale can be suppressed to be small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The second object is achieved by a digital sensor adjusting circuit for adjusting an output of a sensor which senses a physical quantity by processing the output of the sensor by using prestored data for characteristic adjustment, comprising: an analog integrator for integrating outputs of the sensor and outputting resultant data; a comparator for converting and outputting the output of the analog integrator into a digital signal of level 1 or level 0; a 1-bit D/A converter for converting the output of the comparator into an analog signal and outputting the analog signal; and a subtracter for subtracting the output of the 1-bit D/A converter from an input of the analog integrator, wherein the output of the comparator is processed with the prestored data for characteristic adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With the above construction, the output of the sensor for physical detection can be digitized without using a first stage amplification circuit and an A/D converter, so that the functional overhang can be eliminated.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The sensor adjusting circuit according to the invention will be described in detail hereinbelow by embodiments shown in the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of the invention, in which reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes an analog integrator; <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a comparator; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> a digital integrator; <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> an operational unit; <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> a D/A converter (digital-to-analog converter); <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> an LPF (low pass filter); <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> a D/A converter; and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> a PROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The level adjusting circuit according to the invention is mainly divided into three kinds of functional parts. The functional parts are constructed as described hereinbelow in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The first functional part is constructed by the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The difference between an input signal from a sensor S and an output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is subjected to integration of the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The output of the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where the output is compared with a predetermined voltage every predetermined cycle and converted into a signal of level 0 or 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, an output of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supplied to the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and is subjected to integration and a resultant signal is outputted as a time series digital signal of a predetermined number of bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The output of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also supplied to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is converted into an analog signal which is subtracted from the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By the above operation, the first functional part has the function of outputting the time series digital signal having the number of bits equal to that of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and whose average value changes according to the input signal from the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> By setting the operation cycle (inverse number of the frequency) of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a value as small as, for example, {fraction (1/10)} or smaller of the operation cycle (a large value of ten times or larger in terms of frequency) determined from the response speed requested to the sensor as an object, the first functional part displays the function as a so-called oversampling A/D converter. As a result, even when the number of bits of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is set to the minimum of 1 bit, principally, the necessary adjustment range and accuracy can be assured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This is because that the sensor adjusting circuit of the invention realizes necessary adjustment by an operation of the average value. Even if the number of bits of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is 1 bit, the average value of the output signal can be obtained. In this case, the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is unnecessary and it is sufficient to supply the output of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as it is to the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It cannot be said that the case of setting the number of bits of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to 1 bit is very practical since a problem as will be described hereinlater occurs. Nevertheless, according to the invention, the number of bits such as 4 to 12 bits which is much smaller than the number of bits estimated from the required accuracy can be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The second functional part is constructed by the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The signal outputted from the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and digital data read from the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is calculated by the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby varying the average value of the output signals obtained from the first functional part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By the operation, the second functional part has the function of substantially adjusting the zero point and the span of the output signal from the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this case, since the number of bits of the signal outputted from the first functional part is set to a small number of bits as described above, the circuit scale of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be accordingly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Since the digital operational process is executed, unlike adjustment by an analog circuit device, there is not feared that an influence by a device variation and a change in temperature is exerted. Consequently, very accurate adjustment can be easily performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Lastly, the third functional part is constructed by the D/A converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The digital signal outputted from the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is converted into an analog signal by the D/A converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the analog signal outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is smoothed by the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the third functional part has the function of converting the digital signal obtained from the second functional part into the analog signal, averaging the analog signal, and outputting an adjusted sensor signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this case as well, as described above, since the number of bits of the signal outputted from the first functional part is reduced, the circuit scale of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be made small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the oversampling A/D converter comprising the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is used in the embodiment. As a result, even if the number of bits of the digital signal is reduced, the necessary adjustment range and accuracy can be assured and the circuit scale is not enlarged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Since the adjusting process is carried out by a digital signal, there is not feared that an influence by variation of the circuit device for adjustment and a change in temperature is exerted, so that high accuracy can be easily maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The number of bits can be reduced to 1 bit as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The number of bits has the trade-off relation with the number of input signals necessary for averaging in order to assure a desired accuracy. When the number of bits is reduced, the number of input signals for averaging has to be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The time to obtain the average value is limited by the response speed of the sensor as an object. Consequently, with increase in the number of input signals, it is necessary to increase the operational speed of the sensor adjusting circuit itself. As a result, a heavy load is placed especially on the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Since high performance is required, the costs increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, when the number of bits is set to as large as 16 bits, although the operational speed of the sensor adjusting circuit itself can be low, the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have to proceed a large number of bits and the circuit scale is therefore increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In consideration of the above, in the embodiment of the invention, it is decided that 4 to 8 bits is appropriate for the number of bits of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When the number of bits is set to 4 to 8 bits, the operating speed of the sensor adjusting circuit itself is within a practical range and the circuit scale is also within a proper range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the invention will be described more specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the first functional part can be integrated into a sensor circuit of the sensor to be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Such an embodiment will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment when a capacitive sensor is applied as a sensor to be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The capacitive sensor denotes a sensor for sensing a physical quantity to be sensed as a change in capacitance. A capacitive acceleration sensor is typical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, reference numerals <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> denotes analog switches; <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a sensor capacitor; <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a capacitor for feedback; <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> an operational amplifier; and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a reference capacitor. Other elements are the same as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Each of the analog switches is constructed by a known semiconductor switch or the like. The analog switches are divided into two groups A and B and controlled. The analog switches <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> belong to group A and the analog switches <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> belong to group B. When the group A is controlled to be on, the group B is controlled to be off. On the contrary, when the group A is turned off, the group B is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constructed so that its capacitance changes according to the physical quantity to be detected. In this case, if the sensor is the acceleration sensor, the capacitance of the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> changes according to the acceleration acting on the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The operational amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> operates as an integrator by having the capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for feedback, thereby displays the same function as that of the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is charged with an output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and feeds back the output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The operation of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will now be described. In the embodiment, by repeating first and second operations for turning on and off the analog switches of groups A and B alternately, the capacitance value of the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The cycle for repeating the first and second operations can be set to the same as the operational cycle of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the first operation, the analog switches <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of group B are turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Then the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is discharged by the analog switches <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the reference capacitance capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is charged with the output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> via the analog switch <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the second operation, the analog switches <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of group A are turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are connected in series via the analog switches <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the power source voltage Vcc and the ground. The contact point between the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected via the analog switch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to an inversion input of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged with the power source voltage Vcc and the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is discharged. The difference current between the charged current of the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the discharge current of the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is charged into the capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for feedback via the analog switch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As a result, a voltage according to the terminal voltage of the capacitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for feedback appears on the output of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The voltage appeared on the output of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is supplied to the D/A </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>D&equals;CsVcc/CrKda </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> via the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and serves as a value of the charge current to the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the first operation of the next cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the average value as an output of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is obtained by the following equation (1). &emsp;&emsp;(equation 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> where, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> D: average value of outputs of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Cs: capacitance value of the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Vcc: power source voltage </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Cr: capacitance value of the reference capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Kda: conversion coefficient of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As obviously understood from (equation 1), as an output of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> digital signal indicative of the capacitance value of the sensor capacitor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is derived. According to the embodiment, it is therefore understood that the first functional part of the sensor adjusting circuit also serves as the sensor circuit of the capacitive sensor which should be assembled into the sensor adjusting circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, therefore, the sensor adjusting circuit can have the function of the sensor circuit which should be assembled into the sensor adjusting circuit. As a result, the wide adjusting range and the high accuracy can be assured and the circuit scale as a whole including the sensor circuit can be sufficiently reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, a detection error can be also reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the sensor adjusting circuit and the first functional part are separately provided, errors of the respective circuits are added. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, the sensor circuit of the sensor is assembled into the first functional part, so that the error can be reduced by the feedback effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an embodiment when a hot wire type air flow meter used for controlling an engine of a vehicle or the like is employed as the sensor to be assembled. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, reference numerals <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> denote hot wire resistors and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> indicates a differential amplifier. The other component elements are the same as those of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The four hot wire resistors <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> construct a bridge circuit. A voltage when the bridge circuit becomes unbalance by an air flow is detected by the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is outputted as a detection signal of the air flow rate. In this case, by using the output of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a current source of the bridge circuit consisting of the hot wire resistors <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, both of the sensor circuit of the hot wire type air flow meter and the first functional part of the sensor adjusting circuit are constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as well, the sensor adjusting circuit can have the function of the sensor circuit which should be assembled to the sensor adjusting circuit. As a result, the wide adjustment range and the high accuracy can be assured. The circuit scale as a whole including the sensor circuit can be sufficiently reduced and, further, errors can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The operation of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment will be described with reference to the operational block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a circuit for adjusting the zero point and the span of an output of the sensor as an object by executing addition and multiplication using a predetermined value to the average value of input signals (time series digital signals as outputs of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The adding operation for adjusting the zero point is executed as follows. A digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which has been preliminarily written in the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and has the same bit number as that of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and whose average value is an adjustment value as an object is read out and is added to the input signal. By simple performing the addition, the addition to the average value of the input signals can be carried out without changing the number of bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> If an overflow occurs, however, a process for correcting it is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The multiplying operation for span adjustment is executed by reading out a digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and multiplying the input signal by the line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is similarly preliminarily written in the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and has the same number of bits as that of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The average value of the digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is an adjustment value as an object. The frequency characteristic of the digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is set so as not to be overlapped with a frequency distribution of the input signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this case as well, it is sufficient to execute the simple multiplication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Although the number of bits is doubled by the multiplication in this case, since only the initial bits are effective, by cutting off the bits of the lower half, the same number of bits as that of the input signal can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The reason why the frequency distributions are arranged so as not to be overlapped as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When it is assumed that the frequencies of the input signal and the digital processing signal line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are overlapped, a signal in the overlapped frequency band is converted to a direct current signal by the multiplying operation and there is the possibility that the average value goes wrong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> An embodiment in which the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are constructed by an MPU (microprocessing unit) will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The MPU shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> comprises a RAM <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for temporarily storing data, a PROM <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) for storing adjustment data, an accumulator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, an operational unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for executing arithmetic operation, a controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for storing programs. The operational unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a data bus are controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in accordance with a program written in the RAM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and processes necessary for the operations as the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, the ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for storing programs is directly accessed by an output of the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and output data of the ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is directly outputted to the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The instruction system in this case is one word per instruction. A backward branch instruction cannot be accepted and the maximum counting value of the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the number of words of the ROM <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for storing programs are equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in the embodiment, the program correctly operates without performing a reset, so that a reset upon the turn-on of the power source, that is, a power-on reset process is made unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If a reset is not executed upon turn-on of the power source, the counting value of the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> becomes unstable and the program does not know from which address to start. Since there is no backward branch instruction in the program in the embodiment, when the program is started, the counting value of the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is always increased. When the counting value reaches the maximum, it returns to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As a result, it is guaranteed that the program operates by always passing the 0 address and, therefore, the reset process is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, as a matter of course, the program is limited to a so-called cyclic program in which the address is cycled from 0 to the maximum counting value of the program counter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As the program is used only for realizing the operations of the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment, the fact that only the cyclic program can be used is not a limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, it also denotes that the program is not much affected by a runaway of the MPU. Even if the MPU runs away, the destination address of the runaway is always an address of the program and the program is a cyclic program, so that the operation is returned to the normal process eventually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As it is known, it is typical that a general MPU is provided with monitoring means such as a watch dog timer in order to certainly assure the reset operation and deal with the runaway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, however, the resetting process is unnecessary and no problem occurs at the time of runaway of the MPU. Consequently, the monitoring means is made unnecessary. The circuit scale can be reduced and the reliability of the MPU can be improved more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the construction of a memory cell which is a unit of the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment, the unit memory cell is constructed by three PROM memory cells <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and data read from them is outputted via a majority logic circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Generally, the PROM is easily influenced by temperature and the reliability deteriorates at high temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Especially, in case of a sensor for use in an engine room of a vehicle, space, and the like, it is used at high temperature, so that the reliability easily deteriorates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, therefore, data from a plurality of memory cells is used and the majority logic is obtained, thereby realizing an error correction logic and an error detection logic. Thus, erroneous data is eliminated and high reliability is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the invention. As shown in the diagram, a single MPU <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided commonly for a plurality of sensors, for example, three sensors A, B, and C and functions as the digital integrator and the operational unit for the sensors by a time division process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are analog integrators each of which is the same as the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Similarly, each of <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C corresponds to the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, each of <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B corresponds to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, each of <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B corresponds to the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and each of <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C corresponds to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The MPU <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is the one described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As mentioned above, outputs of the sensors A, B, and C are sequentially time division processed in a predetermined order. Like the digital integrator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the MPU <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> operates so as to adjust the zero point and the span of each sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has therefore an advantage that the circuit scale can be reduced more than the case where the digital integrators <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the operational units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are provided for the plurality of sensors, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Since the outputs from the plurality of sensors can be associated with each other and processed, there is an advantage that the an output of a sensor is compensated by an output of another sensor and the embodiment can easily deal with cases where the ratio or difference of outputs of the plurality of sensors is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment of the invention as mentioned above, by using the oversampling analog-to-digital converter, the number of bits of a digital signal necessary to assure the adjustment range and the accuracy can be reduced. As a result, while maintaining the necessary accuracy and adjustment range, the circuit scale can be sufficiently reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The sensor adjusting circuit according to another embodiment of the invention will be described in details by the modes shown in diagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of the sensor adjusting circuit of the invention. The sensor adjusting circuit of the embodiment is constructed mainly by parts of the following three kinds of functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The first part is a part having both of the functions of a first stage amplifier and an A/D converter and comprises a subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; has the function of subtracting an output of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from a detection signal of a sensor (physical quantity sensing device) S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the function of receiving and integrating the difference between an output signal of the sensor S and the output of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from the subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the function of comparing an output voltage of the analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a predetermined reference voltage and converting to a 1-bit signal of level 1 or 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has the function of converting the output of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into an analog voltage and supplies the analog voltage to a negative (&minus;) input terminal of the subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As a result, an output signal (A) whose pulse density changes according to the signal sensed by the sensor S is obtained from the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> A circuit for generating an output signal whose pulse density changes according to an input signal is called a &Dgr;&Sgr; modulator. In the invention, the signal supplied from the sensor S is modulated by using the modulator, thereby enabling the number of bits of the output of the sensor to be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The second part is a part having the function of adjusting the span and the zero point and is constructed by the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is operated by an internal program and the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in which predetermined data has been preliminarily written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> calculates the average value of the pulse density modulated output signals (A) obtained by the first functional part and executes an arithmetic operation to the average value of the output signals and the data stored in the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thereby adjusting the span and the zero point of the output signal of the sensor S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, since the output of the sensor S is processed by the digital arithmetic operation, unlike the adjustment by the analog device, the influence by the variation in devices and the change in temperature is not exerted. Consequently, the adjustment with extremely high accuracy can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Since the signal supplied from the sensor S is modulated and the number of bits is reduced, the circuit scale of this part is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The operation for obtaining the average value of the modulated signal (decimation operation) is also executed by the internal program of the MPU <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the circuit scale can be also reduced from this point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The third part is a part having the D/A converting function and is constructed by a PWM (pulse width modulator) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; and the LPF (low pass filter) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The PWM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; outputs a signal whose pulse width is modulated according to the digital signal outputted from the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is, a pulse width modulation signal. The LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> averages the pulse width modulation signals outputted from the PWM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; and generates analog signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the D/A converting function is obtained by the PWM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; and the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an output signal is derived with high accuracy by performing the span and zero point adjustment to the output signal from the sensor S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> A specific example of the first part in the foregoing embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which the invention is applied to a pressure measuring apparatus using a piezoresistive pressure sensor SP as a physical quantity sensing device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which the invention is applied to an air flow rate measuring apparatus using a heat resistive air flow rate sensor SF as a physical quantity sensing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> will be described first. The pressure sensor SP comprises a bridge circuit constructed by four resistors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which are piezoresistive devices. The balance state of the bridge circuit changes according to a pressure acting on a pressure receiving part of the sensor, thereby obtaining an output voltage indicative of the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The operation of the embodiment will be explained. The circuit comprises six analog switches <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. By repeating two kinds of first and second operations, the switches are opened and closed. In the first operation, the analog switches <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are closed and the analog switches <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> By the operation, a capacitor (capacitive device) <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is charged up with a voltage appearing between the resistors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the pressure sensor SP and a capacitor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is charged up with an output voltage Va of a 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the second operation, the analog switches <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are opened and the analog switches <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> By the operation, the capacitor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is charged up with a voltage across the resistors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the voltage of the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is switched from the voltage across the resistors <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the voltage across the resistors <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The charge amount according to the change in voltage across both terminals of the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the capacitance value of the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is supplied to an operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> via an analog switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and an integrator constructed by the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is charged with the charge amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The capacitor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is charged with an output voltage Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, so that a voltage across the terminals of the capacitor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is switched from the voltage Va to the voltage Vb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> A charge amount according to the change in the voltage across the terminals of the capacitor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the capacitance value of the capacitor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is inputted via the analog switch <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the integrator constructed by the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is charged up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The integrator constructed by the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is therefore charged with charges according to the voltage of the bridge circuit of the pressure sensor SP and the difference between the output voltages Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The result is reflected in the output of the integrator constructed by the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The output is supplied to a comparator <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and is binarized. The binarized data is held by a DFF (D flip flop) <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> so that the result can be reflected upon the next charging operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> An output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is inputted to the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, so that the outputs Va and Vb are changed accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> For example, when the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is 1, the output Va of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> becomes a reference voltage V1 and the output Vb becomes a reference voltage V2. When the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is 0, the output Va becomes the reference voltage V2 and the output Vb becomes the reference voltage V1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> By repeating the first and second operations, the average value of the output voltages of the integrator constructed by the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is converged on 0. As a result, the average value of the voltages of the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> coincides with the output voltage of the pressure sensor SP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> When the average value of the voltages between the outputs Va and Vb is set to be proportional to the average value of outputs of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, by digitally obtaining the average value of the outputs of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, the output voltage of the pressure sensor SP can be derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The degree of change in the average value of the output voltages of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is determined how the voltages at the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are changed, namely, how each of the reference voltages V1 and V2 and the difference of the voltages are decided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> If the change amount of the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> with respect to the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is reduced, the change ratio of the average value of the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> with respect to the change in the bridge voltage of the pressure sensor SP can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Since the outputs of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> have levels of &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo; only, the range of the average value L is 0&gt;L&lt;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> If the sensitivity to the bridge voltage of the pressure sensor SP is increased, the measurement range is narrowed. Contrarily, when the change amount of the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is increased, although the change ratio of the average value of the outputs of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> with respect to the change in the bridge voltage of the pressure sensor SP is reduced, the measurement range is widened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In other words, the optimum change voltage can be applied to the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in accordance with the maximum change amount of the bridge voltage of the pressure sensor SP, so that the measurement range which cannot be changed and expanded by a general A/D converter can be easily changed and expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The input range of a general A/D converter usually corresponds to the power source voltage. On the contrary, the change in the bridge voltage of the pressure sensor SP is tens mV. When a general A/D converter is used, an amplification circuit is therefore necessary at the first stage as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, however, by applying a predetermined change voltage to the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the voltage level can be easily adjusted. Consequently, a preamplifier is made unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Since the input impedance of the circuit is determined by the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in the embodiment, a relatively high input impedance can be easily obtained. Consequently, from the viewpoint of the impedance conversion as well, the amplification circuit at the first stage can be made unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, the outputs Va and Vb of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> can also have a temperature characteristic. Temperature compensation can be therefore carried out in such a manner that the temperature characteristic opposite to that of the pressure sensor SP or that of the circuit is added to the output characteristics of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> to thereby offset the temperature characteristic of the pressure sensor SP or the temperature characteristic of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is different from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> with respect to the points such that the air flow rate sensor SF is used in place of the pressure sensor SP in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and a 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is employed instead of the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The other construction and operation are the same, so that their description is omitted here. Only the different points will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The heat resistive air flow rate sensor SF senses the air flow rate by measuring a radiation amount generated by the air flowing on the surface of a hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, thereby measuring the air flow rate. In practice, a current is flowed to the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is heated by Joule heat generated by the current and is controlled so that the temperature becomes constant, a radiation amount generated by the flow of air and the heating amount by the Joule heat generated by the current are balanced and the value of the current required for the heating is measured, thereby measuring the air flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, the air flow rate sensor SF comprises: a transistor <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for controlling the current supplied to the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>; resistive elements <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for forming the bridge circuit together with the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>; and a differential amplification circuit <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> for detecting the bridge voltage of the bridge circuit and controlling the transistor <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Like the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the resistive element <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is arranged in a passage of air to be measured, detects the air temperature by using the fact that a value of resistance changes according to the temperature of air, and is subjected to temperature compensation. The sensor output is generated as a signal between the connection point of the hot wire resistive element <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the resistive element <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the ground (common potential). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is basically the same as the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the output of the air flow rate sensor SF is generated as a signal which uses one of the levels as a common potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> generates the output Va of a predetermined voltage value when the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is at the level 1 but does not generate a signal when the output of the DFF <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is at the level 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one end of each of the analog switches <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to the ground and an earth potential is received as an output Vb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> as well, by applying a proper change voltage to the 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and generating the output Va of a predetermined voltage to the earth voltage (0 voltage), thereby enabling the amplification circuit at the first stage to be eliminated. The other advantages as those of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> can be also obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the second part will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the second part has the construction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and executes four kinds of tasks time divisionally as described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The first task is the task for decimation and interpolation. The decimation is a process for calculating the average value of the output signals of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The interpolation is a process for modulating a signal outputted from a sensor such as the pressure sensor SP or the air flow rate sensor SF to reduce the number of bits. The first task is executed with the highest priority. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The second task is the task for reading the contents written in the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, executing an arithmetic operation to the information and the average value of the output signals of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> obtained by the first task, and adjusting the span and the zero point of the signal outputted from the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The third task is a subroutine process of the second task and the task for executing multiplication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The fourth task is the task for executing a process which is activated when an external signal PROM_WRITE becomes at the low level, receives information from an SCI (serial communication interface), and writes the information to the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> At timing 2, the external signal PROM_WRITE is at the high level and the counting value of the PC <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> becomes larger than the preset value of the dip switch <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, so that the execution signal for the second task becomes true. At this moment, however, the bit <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the PCCR <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0&rdquo; and counting of the PC <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is stopped.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> At timing 4, similar to timing 2, the execution signal for the second task becomes true.

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> At timing 6, as shown in the diagram, the second task is executed in the beginning. Since &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written to the bit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the PCCR <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> by the second task, execution of the third task is started and is continued through timing 6 and until the start point of timing 7.

<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> At timing 11, the external signal PROM_WRITE becomes at the low level, so that the fourth task operates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> As shown in the diagram, therefore, the first task is executed in a constant cycle according to the counting of the PC <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> when the external signal PROM_WRITE is at the high level. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The operation of the program storing ROM address generator <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> will be described. The program storing ROM address generator <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> has the function of generating an address sinal of a program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is an address map of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. As shown in the diagram, the program of the first task is stored in addresses 000 to 0FF. Similarly, the program of the second task is stored in addresses from 100 to 1FF, the program of the third task is stored in addresses from 200 to 3FF, and the program of the fourth task is stored in addresses from 400 to 4FF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The program storing ROM address generator <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> generates address signals of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> from the execution signals for the tasks generated from the control unit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and the counting values of the PCs <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> as will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> When the execution signal for the first task is true, the upper three bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> are set to &ldquo;000&rdquo;. With respect to the lower 8 bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, the counting value of the PC <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is used as the address signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> When the execution signal for the second task is true, the upper three bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> are set to &ldquo;000&rdquo; and the counting value of the PC <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is used as the lower 8 bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> When the execution signal for the third task is true, the upper two bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> are set to &ldquo;01&rdquo; and the counting value of the PC <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is used as the lower 9 bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> When the execution signal for the fourth task is true, the upper three bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> are set to &ldquo;101&rdquo; and the counting value of the PC <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is used as the lower 8 bits of the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the address signal of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is generated from each of the counting values of the PCs <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and the execution signal for the task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> The operation of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In the bit structure of the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the 7th bit is for an instruction code and the 6th to 0th bits have the bit structure expressing the execution address. One word is used for one instruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> When the instruction code is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, an operation for transferring data from a device designated by the execution address to an accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is executed. When the instruction code is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, an operation for transferring data from the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to a device designated by the execution address is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the control signal of the internal bus and the signal of the address bus can be generated as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> As the signal of the address bus, data from bit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to bit <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> in the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is outputted as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> As the control signal (read and write signals), the data of bit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the program storing ROM <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight> is outputted as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, therefore, the control signal of the internal bus and the signal of the address bus can be generated only by the above operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The operational unit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> will now be described. The operational unit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> has the logic structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> and supports the processes of addition, AND operation, inversion, arithmetic right shift, and arithmetic left shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The adding operation is executed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> in such a manner that the contents of a register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> which is connected to the internal bus and has a predetermined address, and to/from which data can be inputted/read are added to the contents of the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> by an adder <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the result of the addition is supplied to an output port <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> which is connected to the internal bus and has a predetermined address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> For the adding operation, therefore, it is sufficient to transfer addition data to the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, transfer the data to be added to the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and read the output port <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. The addition result can be obtained only by the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The adder <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> deals the data with complement on two. When an overflow or underflow occurs, the maximum positive number or the maximum negative number is set. Consequently, overflow and underflow processes are made unnecessary in the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, therefore, although versatility for the data length is reduced, the number of steps of the program can be reduced and the execution time can be shortened for an application in which the data length is fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The AND operation will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In case of AND operation, similar to the adding operation, the contents of the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the contents of the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> are supplied to an AND operational unit <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and the result of the AND operation is outputted to an output port <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> For the AND operation, it is sufficient to transfer the AND data to the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, transfer data to be subjected to the AND operation to the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and read the output port <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The AND result can be obtained by the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In the inverting operation, the contents of the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are supplied to an inversion operational unit <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the result of the inverting operation is outputted to an output port <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. For the inverting operation, therefore, it is sufficient to transfer data to be inversion operated to the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and read the output port <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. The result of the inverting operation can be easily obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> In the arithmetic right shift operation, the contents of the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are inputted to an arithmetic right shift operational unit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> and the result of the arithmetic right shift operation is outputted to an output port <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. For the arithmetic right shift operation, it is therefore sufficient to transfer data to be subjected to the arithmetic right shift operation to the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and read the output port <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. The result of the arithmetic right shift operation can be obtained only by the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> In the arithmetic left shift operation, the contents of the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are inputted to an arithmetic left shift operational unit <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and the result of the arithmetic left shift operation is outputted to an output port <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. For the arithmetic left shift operation, it is therefore sufficient to transfer data to be subjected to the arithmetic left shift operation to the accumulator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and read the output port <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. The result of the arithmetic left shift operation can be easily obtained by the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The operation of a register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> When the contents of the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> are in a predetermined state or the state of the task execution signal is in a predetermined state, the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> is controlled to be write inhibited on the basis of the existence or absence of occurrence of a carry in the operational unit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. With the structure, a branching process necessary for the arithmetic operation can be falsely realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The condition of the write inhibition is not limited by the existence or absence of the carry. Similarly, writing can be inhibited by occurrence of an overflow, writing of predetermined data to a predetermined register, and the like. Consequently, the operation of a program counter accompanying the branching operation is made unnecessary and the logic scale of the program counter can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment will be described. The first characteristic is that a resetting operation is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In a case of a conventional technique using a regular MPU (microprocessing unit), the resetting operation is always required by the following reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In the conventional technique, the program storing ROM is connected to the same bus to which a data storing ROM, a RAM, an I/O are connected. Consequently, if the resetting operation is not performed, the initial value of the program counter becomes unstable. There is the possibility that the initial value of the program counter indicates the data storing ROM, RAM, or I/O. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> As for the instruction word lengths, there are instructions of one, two, and three words. The length is different according to an instruction code and an addressing mode. Consequently, even if the initial value of the program counter indicates the program storing ROM by chance, it does not always indicate the address including the instruction code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Since the backward branch instruction is generally supported, even if the initial value of the program counter indicates the instruction code of the program storing ROM by chance, there is the possibility to enter an endless loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Further, in the conventional MPU, the number of instruction codes is large and the number of addressing modes is large. Consequently, an instruction decoder itself for analyzing an instruction needs the resetting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> An application program is generally made on the premise of the initial process, so that the initial value of the program counter has to be set to a predetermined value. Consequently, the reset is indispensable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Due to the resetting function, however, a general MPU always has the danger of runaway. For an application which requires strict reliability, therefore, a watch dog timer or the like is provided as a countermeasure for the runaway. The cost of the countermeasure for the runaway is too high to ignore and increase in cost is unavoidable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The invention realizes the operational unit which does not require the resetting operation. Since the resetting operation can be made unnecessary, the danger of runaway is eliminated. The countermeasure for runaway such as a watch dog timer is unnecessary and the operational unit can be applied to a cheap product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The reason why the resetting operation is unnecessary in the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the invention will be described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> The program storing ROM is connected to a data bus which is different from the bus to which the data storing ROM, RAM, I/O and the like are connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> As a result, the possibility that the initial value of the program counter indicates the data storing ROM, RAM, and I/O can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The length of instruction word is fixed to one word, so that the initial value of the program counter always indicates the address including the instruction code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The backward branch instruction can be also eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Generally, since it is necessary to form a loop in an application program, the backward branch is always necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Since a repeating control is executed in the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of the invention as well, a loop is necessary. By using the fact that the counting value of the counter is returned to &ldquo;0&rdquo; when each of the program counters <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is overflowed, a loop for the repeating control is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, two kinds of instruction codes of a load (data transfer to the accumulator) and a store (data transfer from the accumulator) are used, only direct addressing is employed as the addressing mode, and only one accumulator is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> With the structure, the instruction decoder itself is made unnecessary and the logic can be simplified, thereby realizing a logic structure which does not require the resetting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, the application program is limited to adjustment of the zero point and the span of the sensor, calculation for the filtering process, and the like and does not require initialization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> No problem occurs if the application program can be executed from any part with respect to the adjustment of the zero point and the span of the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The second characteristic is that two kinds of instruction codes of loading (data transfer to the accumulator) and storing (data transfer from the accumulator) are used and the instruction decoder is not employed. Consequently, reduction in the logic scale can be realized and the above-mentioned resetting operation can be made unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the above is achieved by adopting the operational unit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> That is, by using the operational unit <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, even if there are two kinds of the instruction codes of loading and storing, the arithmetic operations such as addition, AND operation, inversion, arithmetic right shift and arithmetic left shift can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the branch process is falsely realized by adopting the register <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, so that the inherent branch process is unnecessary. Consequently, only two kinds of the instruction codes of loading and storing of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> The third characteristic is that four kinds of tasks are operated time divisionally with a simple circuit construction in the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the invention. The four program counters (PCs) <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are provided and the four kinds of tasks are executed by the four PCs, thereby enabling complicated processes to be executed with a simple circuit construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The first task can be regarded as a timer interrupting process. The third task can be regarded as a subroutine process. The fourth task can be regarded as an interrupting process by an external signal. Therefore, the complicated operation can be carried out with the simple circuit construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The operation as a decimator of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the function of the decimator. The decimator in the embodiment comprises an FIR filter <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, an IIR filter <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, and an FIF filter <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> each having unit delay circuits Z<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The FIR filter <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is a part having the function of generating 1-bit signals of levels 1 and 0 outputted from the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in a predetermined cycle every 8 cycles and supplying the signals to the IIR filter <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the above operation is realized by the counter <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) which is reset every 8 cycles and is counted up when the output of the comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The IIR filter <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the FIR filter <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> are realized by the first task of the application program of the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The IIR filter <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is provided with a significant digit cancellation compensating circuit <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> for compensating cancellation of significant digits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> The decimator is usually constructed by an FIR filter. The construction is, however, realized only by an extremely large-scaled logic circuit since the characteristic deteriorates due to the cancellation of significant digits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, however, by additionally providing the significant digit cancellation compensating circuit <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the deterioration of the characteristic occurred by the cancellation of significant digits can be reduced. Thus, as shown in the diagram, the decimator is easily realized by a simple logic circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the sensor adjusting circuit of the invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Although the signal process of the single sensor S is executed by the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a one-to-one corresponding manner in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the signal process for a plurality of sensors can be also carried out by a single operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> depending on its processing ability. In the embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> first pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a second pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a temperature sensor ST are controlled by a signal operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> An output of the first pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is modulated by a part comprising a subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, an analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, a comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, and a 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and is supplied as a signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Similarly, an output of the second pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is modulated by a part comprising a subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, an analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, a comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, and a 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C and is supplied as a signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> An output of the temperature sensor ST is modulated by a part comprising a subtracter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, an analog integrator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, a comparator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, and a 1-bit D/A converter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C and is supplied as a signal T to the operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The operational unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> sequentially receives the signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and T time divisionally and executes the following arithmetic operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> For the output of the first pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, correction data for the first pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is read from the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the span and the zero point are nonlinearly adjusted, a process for correcting the temperature by the output of the temperature sensor ST is executed, the processed signal is outputted to the PWM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, and an output <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained from the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A. For the output of the second pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, similarly, correction data for the second pressure sensor SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read out from the PROM <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the span and the zero point are nonlinearly adjusted, a process for correcting the temperature by the output of the temperature sensor ST is executed, the processed signal is outputted to the PWM <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B and an output <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is obtained from the LPF <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Consequently, according to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> as well, the same effects as those in the foregoing embodiment can be obtained. Even when the number of sensors is large, the characteristics of the digital system can be sufficiently utilized by hardly enlarging the hardware scale and the characteristics of the sensor can be adjusted with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment of the invention as mentioned above, the first stage amplification function and the A/D converting function are obtained by performing the &Dgr;&Sgr; modulation to the output of the sensor and the D/A converting function is obtained by the PWM and the filter operation. Consequently, the functional overhang is suppressed and the circuit-scale can be reduced. Thus, the digital signal processor having a very accurate characteristic which can be easily formed on a chip can be provided at low cost. </paragraph>
