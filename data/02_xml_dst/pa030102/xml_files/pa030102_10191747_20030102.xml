<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the art of papermaking, and particularly to a method for conditioning fibrous webs such as paper and paperboard webs on a papermaking machine after the web is dried to improve the properties of the web. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The conventional process of papermaking involves formation of a web of fibers on a papermaking machine using a moving porous foraminous support wherein water is drained from a dilute slurry of fibers deposited on the support with further water removal from the web in a press roll section and final removal of water in a dryer section of the machine. In a typical papermaking process, the fibrous web from the press roll section contains about 32 to 45 wt. % solids. The solids may include wood pulp and/or synthetic fibers along with various additives such as sizing agents, binders, fillers, pigments and the like. The wet web is then passed through a series of internally heated rolls or steam-filled cylinders in the dryer section where the web is dried to about 94% to about 99% solids content by weight. The number of drying cylinders in the dryer section is determined by the amount of water to be evaporated based on a typical evaporation rate of about 3 to about 5 pounds per hour per square foot of total dryer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the dryer section of the paper machine, water is removed from the web mainly by evaporation. Typically, the wet web is alternately contacted on its opposite sides in serpentine fashion with a series of heated co-rotating cylinders to heat the web to a temperature sufficient to evaporate water from the web to the desired dryness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Once dried, the paper or paperboard is often further treated to improve various properties such as smoothness, gloss, wet strength and folding endurance. This further treatment may include adjusting the moisture content of the dried-web, densification on high pressure rolls, calendering and/or heat-treating the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various problems have persisted in the drying and calendering of paper webs on large, high-capacity paper machines. For example, drying and calendering of the products remains a high energy, capital intensive operation. Hence, the industry is challenged to develop newer and more energy efficient drying and calendering techniques. Such techniques include high-intensity drying methods where high temperatures and mechanical pressure is applied to the web during drying. Examples of currently used high-intensity drying techniques include press drying, impulse drying, and thermal/vacuum drying. However, the use of high temperature dryers and/or impulse dryers has led to additional problems such as delamination of multiply board products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the presently used drying and calendering processes, the paper may shrink in width by as much as 5 to 6% which can lead to a significant reduction in the overall production rate, and adversely affect product quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, even with modern, state-of-the-art drying and calendering techniques, there remains a need to further improve the drying and calendering of paper and paperboard products to reduce energy costs and limit paper shrinkage without adversely affecting the physical properties of the finished product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Uneven drying and streaking are other problems which have persisted in production of paper and paperboard webs. The weight and moisture irregularity of the fiber web before drying and calendering, irregularities in the heat transfer from the cylinders, edge effects and variations in the ventilation of the papermaking machine all tend to cause nonuniform drying in the cross-machine direction of the product. Such nonuniformity of drying can lead to further adverse effects on paper quality and increased waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,639 to Walker and U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,643 to Lindblad propose a solution to the problem of uneven drying across the width of the web by periodically spraying water on the web in selected areas across width of the web where low moisture or dry streaks have been detected. Because the water sprays are intermittent and used only when necessary to prevent streaks, such techniques do not effectively increase the drying rate of the web and can introduce nonuniformity in the web surface properties. These and other such approaches also present problems in that the spray nozzles can drip onto the web or otherwise tend to wet the paper in spots or unevenly, resulting in poor efficiency and surface discontinuities in the rewetting, drying and calendering steps, as well as other operational problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention is to improve the efficiency, uniformity and product quality of drying and/or calendering steps in a papermaking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a more effective method for conditioning paper and paperboard products prior to rewetting the products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to increase the drying efficiency of a papermaking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a method for conditioning a paper or paperboard product for calendering which reduces operational problems associated with prior methods, and improves surface finishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an efficient means of cross-directional moisture profiling of a paper or paperboard product on a papermaking machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With regard to the foregoing and other objects, the present invention provides, in accordance with its more general aspects, a method for treating an elongate moving web which comprises conditioning the web by applying a flow of moistened gas to a surface of the moving web across its width and along at least a portion of its length from a plurality of substantially overlapping flow zones wherein the flow in each zone is sufficient to create a combination of suction and pressure forces on the surface of the web to promote convective heat transfer and thereby decrease its surface temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;moistened gas&rdquo; means a carrier or motive gas, such as air, which has an absolute humidity of 0.01 or higher. The state of the water in the moistened gas may be vapor, or more preferably primarily liquid in the form of a relatively fine dispersion of small droplets such as a mist combined with evaporated water in the form of gas. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, it is a feature of the invention that the water droplets are, by virtue of the flow regime used to deliver the moistened gas, propelled against the surface of the web so as to make contact therewith in a relatively even and highly dispersed manner to thereby achieve uniform and rapid cooling and moisturizing of the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the method comprises treating a fibrous web proceeding from a dryer unit of a papermaking machine, the web having a moisture content below about 8 wt. % and a temperature of at least about 80&deg; C., which comprises conditioning the web by applying a flow of moistened gas having a temperature in the range of from about 10&deg; to about 65&deg; C. to a surface of the moving web across its width and along at least a portion of its length from a plurality of substantially overlapping flow zones wherein the flow is sufficient to create a combination of suction and pressure forces on the surface of the web to enhance convective heat transfer and thereby decrease its temperature. Depending on the amount of water applied to the web via the moistened gas, the conditioning may, in addition to decreasing the temperature of the web, increase the moisture content of the web. After the conditioning treatment, the web may be further treated in a process such as calendering, coating and the like. If desired, the web surface, after conditioning may be further moistened using a steaming device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, moistened gas is applied to the web in the aforementioned manner of overlapping flow zones using one or more arrays of radial jet reattachment nozzles. The nozzles are configured and spaced relative to each other and to the surface of the web to cause the moistened gas to be delivered relatively evenly across the web surface in flow patterns which create a combination of suction and pressure forces on the web. This enables the desired rapid surface cooling and moisturizing effect on the web as it proceeds from the dryer unit to any subsequent steaming and/or calendering steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides a papermaking process which comprises depositing an aqueous slurry of cellulosic and/or synthetic fibers at a consistency of from about 0.2 to about 1.5% by weight on a moving web former screen thereby forming a layer of slurry on the screen. The slurry is dewatered on the moving screen to form a fibrous web which is passed from the screen and then pressed with one or more wet press nips to provide a pressed web having a solids content in the range of from about 32 to about 45% by weight. The pressed web is then dried such as on a series of drying cylinders or other suitable drying equipment to provide a dried web having a moisture content of from about 0.2 to about 6% by weight. Thereafter, the dried web is conditioned by applying a flow of moistened gas to the web surface using a plurality of radial jet reattachment nozzles placed in close proximity to the web on one or both sides of the web to provide a conditioned web having a moisture content which is substantially uniformly increased across its width by at least about 0.2% relative to the moisture content prior to conditioning. The conditioned web may then be further rewet, if desired, by steaming or other means, and subsequently smoothed in a calendering unit or such operation. Alternatively, the conditioned web may be coated, which conditioning provides improved coating holdout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> One advantage of treating a web on a papermaking machine according to the invention is that the web may be uniformly and efficiently moisturized and cooled substantially below the temperature of the dried web proceeding from the dryer unit, preferably reducing the surface temperature to less than about 80&deg; C. using an even application of moistened gas so that any subsequent rewetting of the web occurs in the absence of deleterious effects associated with rewetting higher temperature product before calendering. For example, adverse effects on the cross directional shrinkage of the paper or paperboard product may be limited and desired density, tensile strength compression and caliper in the cross machine direction of the finished product may be achieved more readily and consistently with improved control over these and other properties of the finished product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of conditioning a web according to the invention in the papermaking context is that the resulting web thickness and stiffness after calendering to a desired smoothness may be improved as compared to webs conditioned using conventional techniques. Accordingly, the paperboard product can be made with increased bulk for a given basis weight and a product having a reduced basis weight will still meet caliper specifications. The more efficient surface cooling and moisturizing of the web obtained by use of the invention also enables increased spring back properties during calendering since the moisture is retained by the surface fibers of the web more efficiently than with other moisturizing techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In some applications, it may be desirable to cool the web surface without significantly increasing the moisture content of the web. To this end, it will be appreciated that the invention may be practiced to cause emanation of a mist of minute water droplets from an array of radial jet reattachment nozzles wherein the water droplets have sufficient momentum to penetrate the boundary layer of hot, dry air attached to the moving web so that they impact the web surface. The moisture impacting the web surface rapidly cools the surface by acting as both a latent and a sensible heat sink. The applied surface moisture flashes to vapor upon contact with the hot web, thereby cooling the web. By use of an appropriate amount of moisture in the gas, the web surface is cooled without significantly increasing the moisture content of the web. Very high shear rates are attainable using the reattachment nozzles in a reattachment zone of the nozzle flow pattern which provides high convective heat transfer and high mass transfer coefficients to effectively &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; the web surface resulting in more efficient heat transfer from the web surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In applications requiring both cooling and moisturizing, higher mist loadings may be applied to the web surface with the reattachment nozzles resulting in substantial retention of moisture on the web surface. Hence, the web is both cooled and moisturized. This limits or avoids entirely the need to apply moisture to the web using conventional water spray nozzles or other means. If additional surface moisture application is desired, existing methods of applying surface moisture become more effective because of the cooling effects provided by this invention. Furthermore, the reattachment nozzles have fewer moving parts than water spray nozzles thereby reducing the maintenance costs associated with cooling and/or moisturizing a web.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference characters designate like or similar parts throughout the several views, features of various radial jet reattachment nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in practicing the invention will now be described. With initial reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> preferred nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate cylindrical sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which includes an outwardly flared, trumpet-shaped head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> supported on an elongate cylindrical rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is coaxially centered in sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide an annular flow space <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends out of circular open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and, at its widest point or base, has a slightly greater diameter than that of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As will be hereinafter described in greater detail, sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be supported on a plenum or manifold (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) along with a plurality of other like nozzles to provide an array of nozzles for conditioning web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> across its width as the web moves past the array of nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Moistened gas <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, preferably air containing a fine water mist, is directed along annular space <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that it exits the nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through sleeve open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Moisture may be added to the gas by a variety of atomization techniques well known to those of ordinary skill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At the prevailing gas velocities in the annular space <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the shear rate provided by the flowing gas stream will be sufficient to break liquid contained in the air stream into fine droplets, resulting in a turbulent mist emanating radially outwardly from the nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The shape of head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in conjunction with its spacing, dimension and arrangement relative to open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> creates a turbulent flow regime which has the effect of causing flows of gas both toward the web surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as indicated by flow arrows <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and away from the surface of the adjacent web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as indicated by flow arrows <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> near the center of the nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while providing a cushion of gas which limits contact between the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a minimum of fluttering or other undesired movement of the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a direction normal to its surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The relative positions of flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be fixed, or they may be adjustable relative to one another. It is preferred that the position of flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> be adjustable relative to the sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by axial movement of rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the distance between the head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be increased or decreased. By adjustment of the position of the flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in this fashion, the velocity and/or flow rate of moistened gas impinging on web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be varied as well as the flow pattern. In an alternative design, flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be fixed and sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be supported for axial movement relative to head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the distance between the head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be increased or decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that both sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be also supported for movement as a unit in a direction normal to the surface of web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, whereby the spacing between head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and open end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adjusted as well as the spacing of head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the surface of web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Combinations of adjustments in the positions of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and flow director <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> therefore may be employed to adjust the mass flow rate and/or velocity of moistened gas impinging on the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the pattern of flow onto and across the web and the spacing between head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the surface of the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A combination of appropriate nozzle design and adjustment of the distance between the head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and sleeve opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will provide a nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a wide range of operating conditions. By way of example, and not for purposes of limitation, sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have an inside diameter of from about 25 to about 75 millimeters and an outside diameter of from about 26 to about 80 millimeters, and rod <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have a diameter of about 4 to about 5 millimeters so that annular space <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a radial dimension of about 10 to about 35 millimeters. Head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may have a diameter at its widest point within &plusmn;10 percent of the outside diameter of sleeve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this example, the separation space between head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and sleeve opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be varied between operation limits of from about 2 to about 7 millimeters. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Deflector plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably a circular disc as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and preferably contains a circular, cone-shaped upwardly projecting portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for improved formation of fine liquid droplets resulting from the impact of the liquid on deflector plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; and to promote radially outward flow into a turbulent flow regime and the inwardly swirling flow pattern as shown by arrows <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The sloped side walls of portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> form included angles with respect to the planar surface of plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; of about 45&deg;. The apex of portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is preferably axially aligned with orifice <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and spaced therefrom a distance of from about 4 to about 12 millimeters. Head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; preferably has a configuration and is dimensioned corresponding substantially to that of heads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&Prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, respectively, as well as a corresponding adjustable separation distance from sleeve opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;.

In an alternative embodiment, portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is dome shaped rather than conical to aid in droplet generation and distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As with the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the flow of moistened gas as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; provided by nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> causes flows of moistened gas both toward and away from the adjacent surface of moving web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, while providing a cushion effect which limits contact between web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; and head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; with a minimizing of fluttering or other undesired movement of web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; in a direction normal to its surface facing head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. All the while, by virtue of the relatively high velocity flow produced by the various nozzle designs described herein and the swirling turbulent flow regime, the moistened gas effectively &ldquo;scrubs&rdquo; away the flow boundary of relatively high temperature air adjacent the surface of the web enabling water droplets in the moistened gas to be carried into contact with the web surface, whereby rapid evaporative cooling and moisturizing of the web may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As long as sufficient turbulent air flow is maintained for the moistened gas exiting the nozzles, they do not need to be heated to avoid condensation of the mist on the nozzle surfaces. However, if desired, a heating system may be used to maintain the nozzle temperature above the dew point of the moisturized gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The nozzles described herein may be made from a variety of materials appropriate for use in the environment of a papermaking machine. Suitable materials include non-oxidizing or corrosion resistant metals such as stainless steel, nickel, titanium, alloys of iron and nickel, alloys of titanium and aluminum and the like. Other materials may be used provided they are resistant to moisture, stable under high temperature conditions and resilient enough to withstand thermal and mechanical shock such as may occur as a result of a paper web break during production as well as periodic adjustment or maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In contrast to conventional air nozzles, the nozzles used in practicing the present invention provide a highly effective turbulent gas flow adjacent the surface of the web which creates a negative force on the web urging the web toward the nozzle rather than away from the nozzle which is determined to be particularly effective in application of moistened gas to the web. In particular, the gas flow rate and ejection angle of the moistened gas exiting the nozzle induces unusual eddy currents creating areas of reduced pressure between the nozzle and the surface of web urging the web toward the nozzle. However, the flow of moistened gas between the nozzle and the web effectively prevents contact between the web and the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As the web is urged toward the nozzle, moist gas flowing from the nozzle contacts the web radially in substantially all directions. Such gas flow rapidly lowers the surface temperature of the web and, in certain embodiments, increases the moisture content of the web. Some or all of the added surface moisture may flash from the web surface, depending on the web temperature, the weight of the web and the moisture loading of the gas, thereby cooling the web and in some cases increasing its moisture content to within a desired range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the practice of the invention, a plurality of nozzles are used and are arranged in spaced apart fashion in an array spread across the width and along a portion of the length of the web supported in close proximity to the surface of the web, preferably on both sides of the web. The actual number and arrangement of nozzles across the width of the web will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on factors such as the paper basis weight and width, machine speed and the like. In order to achieve optimum web conditioning with the fewest nozzles, the nozzles are preferably arranged in a staggered pattern as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> so that adjacent rows of nozzles are offset from each other both in the cross machine direction and in the direction of web movement as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Many other nozzle arrangements may be used provided the number and arrangement of nozzles is sufficient to effectively condition the web across its width <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The inlet end of each nozzle is preferably connected to an inlet gas plenum for providing a high velocity gas stream to the nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By reason of the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> employing one or more arrays of nozzles according to the various embodiments thereof (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), moistened cooling gas is caused to flow against the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> simultaneously from a plurality of spaced-apart locations across the width <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and along a portion of the length of the web as it moves past the nozzle arrays. The gas flow creates a plurality of overlapping zones of influence on the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> characterized by a combination of vacuum or suction forces as well as pressure forces on the web surface which, along with the turbulence and eddy currents created thereby, penetrates, strips away or significantly disturbs the boundary layer adjacent the web surface for enhanced heat and mass transfer. Furthermore, small water droplets in a fine water mist delivered through nozzles have sufficient momentum to penetrate the boundary layer of hot dry air carried along the web surface from a dryer unit so that a significant portion thereof can readily reach and be absorbed by the web surface. The result is a highly efficient, uniform and rapid moisturizing and cooling effect on the web across its width even at relatively high machine speeds in the order of about 1200 to about 1500 meters per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> preferred sequence of steps according to the invention for conditioning a paper web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on a papermaking machine is illustrated. In this embodiment, nozzles according to the nozzle design <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are illustrated in use, but it is understood that the nozzle designs of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as well as other functionally equivalent designs may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> proceeding from the wet press section (not shown) is conducted in a conventional fashion through any of several papermaking unit processes and ultimately through a dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> comprising a plurality of internally heated dryer cylinders (illustrated diagrammatically as two cylinders, for sake of simplicity) where its moisture content is decreased to about 0.2 to about 6% by weight. Web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> proceeds from dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> at a temperature which may range from about 80&deg; to about 170&deg; C. past one or more arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> above and below the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to condition the web in the aforedescribed manner, lowering its surface temperature in this embodiment by at least about 20&deg; C. and increasing the web moisture content to at least from about 0.2 to about 1.0 percent over the moisture content of the web emerging from dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. However, it will be appreciated that by adjustment of the nozzle configuration and their spacing relative to the surface of the web, as well as the water loading of the moisturized gas, the invention may be practiced so that there is essentially little or no increase in the moisture content of the web while its temperature is nevertheless decreased substantially in a relatively short length of time. It will also be appreciated that the invention may be practices by treating only one surface of the web, depending on manufacturing and product requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is preferred to place the nozzle arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the production line outside of the dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which is typically an enclosed or hooded structure containing a series of stacks of rotating cylinders. Because the nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are not located in the dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, fewer operational problems are likely to occur due to, web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> hanging up on the nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when a break in the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> occurs in the dryer unit. Furthermore, replacement, maintenance or adjustment of the nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be accomplished without having to enter the dryer unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The nozzle arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted on retractable/adjustable support units illustrated diagrammatically at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that the nozzles can be retracted away from the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> automatically when a web break occurs. The retractable nozzle arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> also provide for easier maintenance and movement of the nozzles toward and away from web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Units <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably also provide a plenum or manifold function for directing gas and liquid delivered into units <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as by conduits <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and conduits <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, respectively, wherein individual flows of gas and liquid may be directed to the separate nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the gas and liquid pre-mixed in units <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or even prior to delivery to units for being directed onto the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as moistened gas in the aforedescribed manner. Suitable fans or pumps are employed as necessary to develop the pressure required for the desired flow velocities and flow patterns of moisturized gas from nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> From nozzle arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be further treated in a steaming unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> containing a plurality of steam nozzles <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> wherein steam is applied to the web to increase its moisture content to desired degree which may be an increase of from about 0.3 to at least about 2% by weight over and above that of web proceeding from nozzle arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to a final moisture content of from about 1.5 to about 8% by weight. It will be understood that multiple steam nozzles <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in multiple rows along the machine direction may be used to effectively rewet the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, however, for simplicity, only a single steam nozzle <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After the steaming unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is preferably then processed through one or more calender units <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for enhancement of the web surface smoothness and caliper uniformity and other purposes. Typically, one or more rolls in the calendering unit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are heated and are arranged relative to one another to nip the product proceeding therethrough at pressures ranging from about 100 to about 1500 pli, although the pressure can vary outside these limits depending on the product being processed and the effect to be produced on the web. The web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> emerging from calendering unit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> typically has a moisture content below about 7 wt. % and a substantially uniform thickness and smoothness across its width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in contrast with conventional practice, use of arrays <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of radial jet reattachment nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention effectively conditions the web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by cooling the web with moist gas resulting in more effective rewetting of the web with steam in the steaming unit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Because the nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provide relatively uniform conditioning of the web prior to rewetting the web with steam, the efficiency of web calendering is also improved without adversely affecting other properties of the web such as strength, dimensional stability, streaking, shrinkage in the cross machine direction and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As an exemplary embodiment involving the production of 180 lb/3000 ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>basis weight paper having a width 72 of 100 inches at a machine speed of about 800 ft/min., a nozzle array believed to be effective for conditioning the web prior to calendering includes 100 nozzles arranged in four staggered rows (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) with 25 nozzles per row across the width of the web. Adjacent nozzles are preferably uniformly spaced a distance of 4 inches measured from the centers of the adjacent nozzles. The ends of the nozzles are preferably spaced from about 0.5 to about 2 inches away from the surface of the web, which spacing is adjustable to achieve optimum effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Gas delivered to the nozzles is air and liquid delivered to nozzles is water and the gas is moistened by atomized water droplets to an absolute humidity of at least about 0.01 at a temperature of about 32&deg; C. In this exemplary arrangement, moistened gas is emitted from the nozzles at flow velocities in the range of from about 100 to about 300 feet per second.
