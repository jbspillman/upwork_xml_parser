<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and device for monitoring blood pressure. In particular, such method and device is non-invasive to the human body and the device is preferably portable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Hypertension is a silent killer. According to the National Health Survey, 1998, about 27.3% of the Singapore population between the ages of 30-69 years are hypertensive. This translates to about 600,000 hypertensives based on the 2.2 million people in this age group, of whom about half have not been previously diagnosed. The prevalence of hypertension and its related complications are on the rise, with: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. one new hospital admission for stroke every hour; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. 25% of stroke patients are &lt;45 years old; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 3. one heart attack every 3 hours as recorded by the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 4. more and younger patients requiring renal dialysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Such facts are not unique to Singapore. Many developed countries have comparable, if not higher, statistics. In other words, hypertension is a global problem of epidemic proportions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In Singapore alone, there is at least one person coming down with stroke every hour. The numbers are rising year after year. Moreover, death from stroke in Singapore accounts for more than 12% of all deaths since 1996. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Together with heart ailment, it accounts for more than 32% of all deaths since 1996, i.e. more than one-third of all mortalities in Singapore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, every year there are about 27,000 to 30,000 pregnancies leading to successful deliveries. Of these, thousands of pregnant women suffer from a condition called pre-eclampsia. This is a condition whereby the mother suffers from a rise in blood pressure during pregnancy. The blood pressure can rise to dangerous levels without warning and it can lead to convulsion and brain damage to the mother, and sudden intra-uterine death of the baby. The morbidity and mortality of pre-eclampsia is directly related to the level and control of blood pressure of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The central event linking the 3 major ailments is blood pressure. In fact, in many instances of strokes and heart attacks, the usual and final pathway is a sudden and dangerous rise in blood pressure before catastrophe strikes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the detection and prevention of further rises or falls in the final pathway holds the key to the prevention and reduction of strokes, heart attacks and eclampsia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Currently, patients who suffer from the above illnesses are monitored either as outpatients or in-patients in a hospital. The majority of these are outpatients. When one visits a doctor, be it monthly or fortnightly, the blood pressure reading is obtained by using a blood pressure cuff sphygmomanometer. They use occlusive methods, i.e. air is pumped into the cuff to occlude the artery and is slowly released to finally allow the blood to overcome the resistance and flow through. A flow turbulence is thus set up and picked up by the doctor listening to it. The blood pressure is then recorded. The self-monitoring devices that are available on the market generally all use occlusive methods, the difference being the turbulence are picked up by various methods, such as via a microphone. In other words, the number of readings is totally dependent on the number of times that the artery is being occluded, whether it is manual or pre-set electronically. The monitoring is therefore not continuous, in the sense of having beat-to-beat readings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To make matters worse, whenever the doctor detects a normal or &ldquo;good&rdquo; blood pressure in his clinic, he usually makes 3 assumptions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 1. the patient&apos;s blood pressure from the last test must be &ldquo;good&rdquo;; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 2. his blood pressure until the next test will be &ldquo;good&rdquo;; therefore, he will not have a stroke, heart attack or convulsion as in the case of a pre-eclampsic woman. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, these assumptions are far from the truth as the above incidents have revealed. Casual blood pressure measurements taken in the doctor&apos;s office or by the patients themselves are not necessarily representative of a person&apos;s 24-hours blood pressure. Therefore, it would be advantageous to be able to catch the &ldquo;final pathway&rdquo; of sudden changes in blood pressure/pulse, by being able to monitor a person&apos;s blood pressure continuously and be able to sound the alarm at the right time to prevent a catastrophe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> One method of continuously monitoring blood pressure is suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 5,485,848. That patent purports to disclose a non-invasive and non-intrusive portable device for monitoring a user&apos;s arterial blood pressure. However, that device has the disadvantage that it needs to fix a nominal or base pressure by fixing the strap tension. The calibration is also user-specific. It assumes that base pressure can be maintained constant for the calibration to work. It is not practically possible to fix the base pressure of a moving wrist by the methods described. At most, it only keeps the strap circumference constant, instead of keeping the pressure constant. By fixing the circumference of the strap, pressure changes are even greater with movement and changes in position of the hand. Thus, the wrist position cannot change. In practice, it is difficult to keep the pressure constant as a slight change in wrist pressure and sensor position affects readings to an appreciable extent. Furthermore, the calibration involves extrapolation and interpolation of readings. Therefore, user conditions must remain uniform, since one has to show a linear relationship which may not exist if user conditions are otherwise. In accordance with the described formula for calculating blood pressure, the pressure sensed by the piezoelectric film transducer is dependent on the area of contact, distance from the artery and source of the signal. These are factors which cannot practically be fixed with the described device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To provide continuity in monitoring, the blood pressure must be measured on a beat-to-beat basis, as in intra-arterial monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The time-keeping function of a watch should be integrated with the blood pressure data, as this will provide a meaningful interpretation of the trend or pattern of blood pressure seen or recorded over a period of time. The downloading of data over time may become important in an unfortunate event of the death of a wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the collection of data by the sensor, the position of the sensor and the fixation of the sensor must be considered. In order to accurately collect data from every beat of the heart, the sensor compartment must be able to receive reliable data with the wrist in different positions. In the prior art, the data can only be reliably collected when the hand is held fixed at a certain position, i.e. with restrictions. The prior art may try to overcome the movement of the strap by increasing the strap pressure. Usually, this is not only impractical, but undesirable as the compression of veins will cause significant congestion in the hand distal to it in just a few minutes. This can lead to numbness and further medical complications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The Median Nerve at the Carpal Tunnel would be compressed causing numbness of the finger in a few minutes. As a result, the hand or fingers will swell, causing further congestion. This not only greatly affects the signal, but is harmful to the wearer. Therefore, the challenge is to be able to design the strap system that is comfortable to the wearer over a long period and holds the sensor in position well so as to allow for natural movement of the hand/wrist and collects the data accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The donning and doffing of the wrist monitor and the whole calibration has to be simple and user-friendly for it to be of value for a person who is not medically trained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> However, there is overwhelming evidence in the past 3-4 years that demand us to take a new look at blood pressure monitoring. According to Professor Eoin O&apos;Brien from the Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, different individuals fall into distinctly different blood pressure patterns, which can only be identified by 24-hours tracings of the blood pressure (as opposed to single, momentary clinic/office reading). The 9 (not exhaustive) main blood pressure patterns identified are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 1. Normal Blood Pressure; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 2. Borderline Hypertension; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 3. Isolated Systolic Hypertension; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 4. Isolated Diastolic Hypertension; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 5. Systolic &amp; Diastolic Hypertension with night time dip; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 6. Systolic &amp; Diastolic Hypertension without night time dip; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 7. Nocturnal Hypertension; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 8. White Coat Hypertension; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 9. White Coat Normotension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Naturally, each individual pattern has its own risks and implications that require its unique management, which may or may not require pharmacological intervention. Without 24-hours blood pressure tracings, White Coat Hypertensive patients may unwittingly be put at increased risk due to unnecessary treatment. On the other hand, certain blood pressure patterns may predispose an individual to increased risk of a stroke or heart attack and early recognition of these patterns allow appropriate treatment to be given to arrest or slow the progression of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Against this medical background and clinical deficiency, the object of the present invention is to provide an improved device and method for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, there are several major components in the design of the device. They are the sensor system to measure the blood pressure, a housing for the sensor, the strap system to secure the sensor relative to an artery and electronic processing unit housed in the watch head for calibration and other interfacing purposes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Measuring of Blood Pressure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The principle behind the design of the present invention is to mimic the intra-arterial measurement of blood pressure. This intra-arterial method of blood pressure measurement is at present invasive to the human body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an illustration of an intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the prior art. The intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generally comprises an intra-arterial cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, that is inserted into the radial artery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a patient&apos;s wrist <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the radial artery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is adjacent to the radial bone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The intra-arterial cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a fluid interface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, containing a fluid column. The fluid <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> interface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected by a tube to a microprocessor and sensor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor and sensor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> detects changes in the blood pressure in the radial artery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and this information is transmitted to a pressure display unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the intra-arterial blood pressure measuring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the blood pressure in the radial artery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is sensed, beat-to-beat by the blood column in the inducting cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This beat-to-beat change acts on the column of fluid, which is incompressible and will faithfully relay the pressure change to the microprocessor. The electronic change in signal is then converted to a digital form and displayed on a graph on the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the systolic being the pressure value when the heart pumps, and diastolic, the pressure of the column at rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The primary disadvantage of the intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is that it is invasive. The patient feels discomfort and pain as the intra-arterial cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inserted into his skin <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and artery <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also not portable, such that it is normally only used in a hospital environment. It is not possible to monitor a person&apos;s blood pressure continuously when he is going about his normal daily activities. Intra-arterial measurements cannot be taken with any movement of the wrist. Therefore, the whole wrist must be immobilised, as during an operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> This present invention utilises the principle of Applanation Tonometry to capture the arterial pulse waveform, from which the blood pressure patterns and other medically relevant parameters are derived. Unlike currently available devices, this breakthrough method is neither occlusive nor invasive, and is capable of continuous, 24-hours beat-to-beat monitoring </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the design of the present invention, the whole system including the strap, the sensor and the wrist head have to be considered together in order to appreciate the similarity in principle to the intra-arterial cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Components of the Sensor System </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side view of a sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the invention. An alternate variation of the sensor is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which produces a voltage output according to pressure changes acting on its diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is affixed next to the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a dome shaped or hemispherical head. The plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sits on the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to give a constant resting force on the transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is able to float freely in a vertical direction due to a pre-determined gap between the base of plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an effective length which is the depth of the applanation, corresponding to a preferred range of 3 mm to 10 mm. The diameter of the plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably between 3 mm to 8 mm which correspond to the physiological diameter of an artery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In use the plunger 16 pushes into the wrist and partially occludes the radial artery. The hemispherical shape of plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> ensures comfort over long hours of wearing and also enables pulsation to be faithfully transmitted to the transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, it enables the transmission of the pulsation of the radial artery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be picked up even though the wearer&apos;s hand may be at various positions as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A layer of gel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> sits between the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the gel layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> filters out interference and sharp changes due to unnatural movement. The gel layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also dampens the noise to signal ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in that embodiment the senor is fitted within a housing. The housing has an outer cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and an inner carrier portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The housing will be described further on with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. In this form the sensor includes a pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> which produces the voltage output according to pressure changes acting on its diaphragm <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. A plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> has a domed head <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>. The domed head <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> protrudes through a circular aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in the housing <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. It is free to move towards the pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. When not pressed toward the pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> there is a slight gap between the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> of pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. The pressure transducer is thereby free floating. This ensures there is no preload of the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> against the pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> the plunger depth is selected so that in most normal wrists (e.g.: wrist <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), the plunger can occlude not more than half the diameter of the radial artery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the strap is comfortably worn. This will enable full and faithful transmission of the arterial pulsation to be picked up, including the expansion of the arterial walls, the turbulence of the flow and the vibration transmitted along the artery wall from the heart. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Sensor Housing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate the preferred housing. The housing includes an outer cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and an inner carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The outer cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a smooth convex outer surface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a pair of side guards <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> the purpose of the convex outer surface and side guards will be set forth later with reference to the padding and anchoring system. The inward face of cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a receptacle <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> for receiving the transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. A set of protruding legs <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> extend from the inward face of cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> toward the carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes a generally circular recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> for receiving the body of the transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. The circular recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> includes a series of concentric terraces ending at a circular aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The circular aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> opens between the recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> through the inward face <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> of the carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> has a flattened cylindrical main body <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> and an flanged upper end <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> rests on second terrace <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> within the recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The flange of the flanged upper end <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> rests on first terrace <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. A pair of locating members <highlight><bold>927</bold></highlight> extend downward from the cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The locating members <highlight><bold>927</bold></highlight> press against the flanged upper end <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> of the transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> and locate the transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> against the terraces <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> has an annular retaining flange <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> at its end distal from its domed end <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight>. The retaining flange <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> seats on third terrace <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight>. Third terrace <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight> appears as a lip surrounding aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. This lip retains the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> to the housing. The spacing between terraces <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> of pressure transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> are all such that when the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> is urged toward leaving the housing through aperture <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, but retained by terrace <highlight><bold>929</bold></highlight>, a narrow space or gap <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> lies between the plunger <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. As referred to earlier this gap ensures there is no preload on the transducer <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes locating holes <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> in its outer surface, which receive the legs <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The carrying portion includes a notch <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in the wall of recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The notch <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> provides an opening to recess <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> with the cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> located on the carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. This opening permits wiring connections to the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes a pair of connection legs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> extending from either end. Each pair of connection legs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are adapted to receive and retain a spring loaded watch strap retaining bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a side view of the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> used on the wrist <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a wearer and placed adjacent to and partially occluding the radial artery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the wearer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an illustration of the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> placed next to the radial artery wherein the user&apos;s hand is flexed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably placed adjacent to the radial artery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The radial artery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the wrist <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has been chosen because firstly, it rests on the radial bone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> dorsally. The radial bone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> allows for full transmission of the pulsation to be felt as it is rigid and would not allow for any significant soft tissue compensation. Vertically, the sensor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is locked in together with the watch straps and watch head as one immovable and un-stretchable unit. The plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is thus behaving similarly to the intra-arterial cannula <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the fluid column <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As the plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are the only moving units at each pulsation, the arterial pressure is accurately picked up as a waveform as each heart beat reaches the radial artery. Nevertheless, the advantage is that there is no need for the system to be invasive and it is portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The following reasons improve the functionality of the sensor system: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 1. For a change in pressure between 0 mmHg-300 mmHg, the displacement of the diaphragm against the pressure variation forms a linear relationship. The range of voltage change in the sensor for <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such an equation is between 0.5V to 4V, after amplification of the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> 2. The hemispherical plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> allows for faithful transmission in various wrist positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 3. The system does not require any fixation of strap pressure. Its main aim is to pick up the waveform of the pressure in the artery for calibration and calculation of blood pressure values in the software program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The housing is designed to house the transducer and the plunger and to effect a vertical applanation force against the radial artery when used with an elastic strap. This is achieved by having a smooth convex outer surface (casing cover) with a guard along the side. The smooth convex surface allows the strap to slide over the casing while the guard maintains the strap in place. The casing chamber houses the transducer firmly with the diaphragm surface facing inwards. The inner surface of the housing is designed with seating for the plunger while allowing a pre-determined gap between the plunger surface and the diaphragm. The plunger protrudes from the pre-determined aperture in the inner casing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The Strap System </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the housing enclosing the sensor is connected with a watch head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and with the wrist of a wearer by a system of straps and padding. The watch head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a first strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> extending from one side edge to connect with a first pair of straps securing legs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of the carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of the housing. The first strap portion <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> is preferably of a length set for a particular user such that with the watch head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> against the outer plane of a user&apos;s wrist the plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sensor will imponge against the radial aretary. This requires the housing to be skewed to one side of the inner face of the user&apos;s wrist. The first strap portion <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> will hereafter be referred to as the radial watch strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The watch head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> has a second strap portion <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> extending from its other side edge. The second strap portion <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> will be referred to as the ulnar strap. The ulnar strap <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> has an end <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> that passes outwardly through an oblong ring <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> and back upon itself. This outer end <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> fixes to the inner portion of the ulnar strap <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. This fixing is preferably adjustable, for example by a hook and loop fastener arrangement between the overlap of inner and outer portions. The radial strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> and the ulnar strap <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> are preferably substantially non-extensile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A second oblong securing ring <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> is secured to the radial strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. Preferably this securment is by a short connecting loop <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight> connected with the radial strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> and having an end <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> passing outwardly through the oblong ring <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> to double back on and be secured to itself. An elasticaly extensile strap portion <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is connected with the second pair of strap connecting legs <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of the sensor housing. The elastic strap passes outwardly through the oblong ring <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. An outward portion <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> doubles back over the inward portion <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and passes over the outside of the cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the sensor housing. The strap is constrained to sit over the convex outer surface by side walls <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The other end <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> of elastic strap <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> passes outwardly through the second oblong ring <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight> doubling back and being secured thereto to itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A cuff <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of padding material is provided within the circle of watch head <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, straps <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, carrying portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of the sensor housing and radial strap <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. The cuff <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of padding material includes an aperture fitting over plunger <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sensor. An annular double sided self-adhesive pad between the cuff and the sensor housing secures the cuff to the sensor housing with the plunger protruding through the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> With the device in place on a user&apos;s wrist and the straps appropriately tensioned the elastic strap <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> extending across the convex surface of the cover portion <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> results in a perpendicular applanation force. It has been found to provide a suitably constant force under a range of user movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> This consists of <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> segments, namely the sensor segment and the locking segment. The sensor segment has an elastic loop with one end attached to the watch head and the other end to housing, with the elastic portion positioned to slide over the convex surface of the outer casing. This will result in a vertical applanation force on the housing when the elastic loop is pulled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The convex shape of the housing allows an even spread applied axial force onto the plunger with the aid of the elastic strap portion. </paragraph>

Blood pressure readings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are taken by the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are amplified to a value that can be read by a microcontroller/microprocessor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. An example of the microcontroller/microprocessor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> suitable for use with the device may be the Motorola 68 series of microprocessor. Optionally, a temperature sensor as found in the art could also be included into the device to read the body temperature, and send the readings to the microcontroller/microprocessor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The readings are preferably stored into a storage component <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The microcontroller/microprocessor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may also be coupled to various alarms <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, such as blood pressure, body temperature and heart-beat alarms to warn the user if a pre-determined value is reached. The device is powered by a power supply. The readings, whether taken in real-time or stored in the storage component <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, can be downloaded into a personal computer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or other communication device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the preferred form of the invention these components, which comprise the electronic processing unit, are housed in the watch <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a schematic circuit diagram of a blood pressure monitor device designed according to the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. It demonstrates the circuit connection of the primary components of the device, including the pressure sensor input <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, body temperature input <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, liquid-crystal display module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for display on the device, the EEPROM storage <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, blood pressure alarm <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, transceiver <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, power supply <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and button switches <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor is programmed to perform certain data collection, data processing and data transmission functions. The data collection preferably occurs on a continuous basis. Data processing is preferably performed at least to calculate estimated absolute pressure readings from the electrical sensor readings. This processed data may be then directly uploaded or transmitted for further processing outside the device or may be further processed within the device for either discrete analysis, such as for graphing blood pressures over time, and for waveform analysis as will be described further on. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Data Collection </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a sample graph showing the voltage output produced by the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the described embodiment in response to a pressure applied to the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the sensor includes a transducer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The transducer is preferably one which provides a change in voltage that is directly proportional to the amount of pressure applied onto the transducer to produce a linear graph similar to the one illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. It was found that a suitable transducer is the Foxboro/ICT Model 1865 transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> With the sensor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used, and a microprocessor employed in the watch head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to calculate the readings produced by the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, up to 32 values per second were obtained during tests on the device. By varying the intervals of each detection, i.e. the number of values per second, the inventors have been able to obtain optimal waveforms at 32 readings per second. These waveforms correspond to the systolic/diastolic cycle of the heart when the readings were compared simultaneously with conventional Doppler machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a sample chart showing sensor readings of a wearer&apos;s blood pressure taken over 6 seconds. There are a total of 6 systolic and 6 diastolic values provided. These systolic and diastolic readings are averaged under the calibration procedure described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8 a</cross-reference> sample chart is shown being a Pressure v Time graph compiled using the continuous sensor readings rather than discrete readings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> the pressure waveform <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for a single arterial pulse can be seen to begin at a first diastolic trough <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and end at the next subsequent diastolic trough <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The waveform <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> includes the systolic peak <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the dicrotic notch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Calibration </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an auto-calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is connected to the blood pressure monitoring device (watch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) for calibration purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The auto-calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has been designed to give an absolute value of the blood pressure using a conventional occlusive method. The concept is that a separate wrist-band <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is strapped to the wrist <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> next to the watch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The wrist-band <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> uses a cuff system that is automated, self-inflating and measures the absolute blood pressure for reference by the blood pressure monitoring device (watch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Instead of a liquid crystal display on the said auto-calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the data read by the wrist-band may be immediately processed by its microprocessor (not shown) and downloaded to the watch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via a 3-pin outlet <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to calibrate the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The electronically operated cuff-type non-continuous blood-pressure monitor set at the wrist level is already available in the market. The inventors have designed a software program and a microprocessor to download the systolic and diastolic readings into the watch-head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Simultaneous with the calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> taking the systolic and diastolic reading, the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the watch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> takes the blood pressure readings and waveforms of the last 6 seconds. As mentioned, 10 readings are taken per second and 60 readings are therefore taken during the 6 seconds. A sample wave-form has been illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The average of the peak readings (systolic) are calculated after sampling to obtain greater accuracy. Sampling includes filtering readings that do not correspond to an expected wave-form (for example, muscle contractions produce a sharper and symmetrically-formed peak). Correspondingly, the average of the trough readings (diastolic) are also calculated. The values of the average systolic and diastolic readings respectively are compared to the systolic and diastolic readings from the auto-calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, to assign absolute values to the sensor readings with reference to a voltage level. It is then verified by the software program using the linear relationship of the pressure against voltage change characterized by the sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (a chart illustrating the linear relationship is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) as a guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can then be removed and continuous blood pressure monitoring commences. At any one time, the value of the blood pressure can be checked or verified by the calibrator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (which reading may be displayed on the watch-head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). This is useful when the alarm is sounded when, for example, the blood pressure is outside a pre-determined range, or reaches a preset value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The pulse rate may also be calculated simply by the time interval between 2 systolic or diastolic values divided by 60 seconds. Therefore, this gives a beat-to-beat heart rate and therefore allows verification of the regularity of the heart beat when the data is provided over a period of time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Steps in Calibration </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a flow-chart summarizing the steps involved in the calibration procedure. In brief, these are to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Put on the auto-calibrator adjacent to the watch in a neutral position of the wrist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> 2. Connect the calibrator to the watch through the physical interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 3. Switch on the calibrator to inflate and deflate the cuff automatically, thereby obtaining the systolic and diastolic readings. These readings are displayed on the watch-head and absolute values are assigned to the sensor readings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 4. Remove the auto-calibrator when calibration is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The processor is programmed to calibrate the arterial pulse waveform from the pressure transducer output using equations 6, 6(a) and 6(b). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In particular the instantaneous blood pressure Pj at a sample point is calculated as:

<heading lvl="1">Waveform Processing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A waveform is captured as a series of points from the continuous electrical signal generated by the pressure transducer. A complete arterial waveform including the dicrotic notch is captured. The peaks of the continuous waveform are isolated, the diastolic trough is located and the dicrotic notch is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The electrical sensor output is converted to pressure readings using the calibration set forth above with reference to equation 6. The electrical sensor output is also run through a peak gate providing a digital output. The peak gate has a predetermined threshold voltage. When the sensor output is above the threshold voltage the peak gate is &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;open&rdquo;. When the sensor voltage is below the threshold voltage the peak gate is &ldquo;off&rdquo; or &ldquo;closed&rdquo;. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the peak gate threshold is preferably chosen to be approximately in the middle of the pressure transducer range in normal pressure monitoring use. For example if under normal conditions the sensor output ranges between 100 mV and 300 mV then an appropriate peak gate threshold to choose would be 200 mV. The peak gate output is used in the preferred method of locating the systolic peak, diastolic trough and dicrotic notch. The peak gate logic could also be implemented in software, processing either the raw sensor signal or the calibrated pressure reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention the systolic peak, diastolic end point and dicrotic notch are located in accordance with the following method: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> 1. A series of sampling points is captured continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> 2. Each sampling point is compared with the status of the peak gate, either &ldquo;Peak gate Open&rdquo; (PGO) or &ldquo;Peak-gate Close&rdquo; (PGC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> 3. The highest sampling point taken during the &ldquo;PGO&rdquo; phase is assigned as the peak Systolic value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> 4. From this point, the sampled values will show a downward trend even as the peak gate remains open until the peak gate threshold is reached. After this point, the PGC phase will follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> 5. After the PGC phase resumes the first peak (a rise followed by a fall), is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> This peak is recorded as the &ldquo;Dicrotic Notch&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> 6. The process of detecting the diastolic end point begins when the next PGO is triggered at the peak gate threshold voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> 7. The sampled values are checked in the reverse direction i.e. comparing each point to the previous one, until the first rise is located. This indicates the diastolic end point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The sample pressure at this time point constitutes the end-diastolic pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> 8. The logic cycle is repeated for each arterial waveform in turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The recorded arterial waveform, and location of the dicrotic notch and diastolic end point are used to calculate certain characteristics. These characteristics include the mean arterial pressure, a mean systolic pressure and a mean diastolic pressure. These calculated characteristics are further used to calculate a mean systolic pressure index and a mean diastolic pressure index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In particular the microprocessor is programmed to perform calculations in accordance with the following equations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is computed using equation (1), as the area under the pressure waveform between 2 consecutive troughs.

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The mean systolic pressure the mean diastolic pressure the MSP index and the MDP index are believed to be useful quantified measures of the shape of the pressure waveform which will have clinical uses as indicators of one or more medical conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that final processing of waveforms to produce the MAP, MSP, MDP, MSP_index and MDP_index may be conducted either within the device or externally of the device, for example using waveform data downloaded from the device at intervals or continuously transmitted from the device to a receiving computer or other device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Another objective of the collection and storage of data is to be able to see trends in blood pressure readings and determine the danger-point of the change in blood pressure during a pre-determined period of time. Since blood pressure readings are stored in the watch memory module with respect to a time, such trends in change of blood pressure over a period of time can be monitored. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flow-chart summarizing the steps involved in taking blood pressure readings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The sequence of steps involved in taking discrete, pulse by pulse, blood pressure readings begins by executing a blood pressure reading loop of steps <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. This loop includes reading the date and time from the internal clock of the device at step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, taking an instantaneous blood pressure reading at step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and storing the date and time and associated blood pressure reading in memory at step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. This loop is executed at short intervals over a one half hour period. Until it has been determined at step <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> that the half hour period has elapsed the loop returns to step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor is programmed so that once it determines at step <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> that the half hour is up it proceeds to average and store the blood pressure readings for the just elapsed half hour interval. The microprocessor is programmed to calculate at step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> average systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings from the readings stored in memory. It is programmed to store at step <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> the current date and time and the average blood pressure readings calculated at step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> in memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor is programmed to determine at step <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> whether a full 24 hour time period has elapsed. If not then it returns to step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and the pressure reading loop. If the microprocessor determines at step <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> that a 24 hour time period has elapsed it is programmed to proceed to steps <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> the microprocessor reads the half hourly records for the immediately preceding 24 hour interval and averages these to a single record. At step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> the microprocessor stores the present date and time and the averaged 24 hour reading into memory. It will be appreciated that in most operating circumstances the device will be repeating the loop of steps <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. This loop may also include provision for setting or resetting a blood pressure alarm using buttons <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (e.g.: step <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Communication Tool </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The watch is preferably provided with an interface <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to connect to a personal computer to download data or to a printer to print data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a flow-chart summarizing the steps involved in the data transfer and communications aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> summarises the process that the personal computer software is programmed to implement according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In particular the software is programmed to begin by initialising the personal computer serial port at step <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. With the personal computer serial port initialised at step <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> the software proceeds to send a signal to the watch microprocessor at step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> the software determines whether the watch microprocessor has acknowledged the initial communication signal of step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. If the signal has not been acknowledged it repeats step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and continues to loop step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> until receipt is acknowledged. Once acknowledgement has been received from the watch microprocessor the software proceeds to step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and establish full communication through a handshaking process. The software then proceeds to perform a loop of steps <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to upload data. At each repetition of step <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> the software uploads a single dataset from the memory of the device. Each reading includes the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, date and time. At step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> the software determines whether the upload is complete. If not it returns and repeats step <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> for the next data set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Once the microprocessor determines at step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> that upload is complete the software proceeds to store the uploaded data in a database at step <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. The software provides the capability of printing out the data results, (e.g.: at step <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>) and plotting summary graphs such as blood pressure v time and blood pressure v pulse rate, (e.g.: at step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Although the watch may be connected directly to a personal computer by a direct cable connection such as IRS 323, Universal Serial Bus or other similar interface, the watch may advantageously be provided with wireless communication, particularly for the output of continuous waveforms. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Setting of Alarm </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> It is believed that many catastrophic events occur when the blood pressure suddenly increases or decreases drastically in a patient. This is true in some stroke patients and very evident in pre-eclampsia patients. The aim of the continuous monitoring is firstly to discover and help the control of blood pressure. Secondly, in some cases, a tragedy may be avoided if there is an alarm system to detect these sudden and drastic changes. The alarm thresholds can be preset at the factory or individually set using buttons <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and multiple alarms can be set for the blood pressure or pulse rates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a flow-chart summarizing the steps involved in setting the alarm in the watch to warn of potentially dangerous blood pressure levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In particular the microprocessor is programmed to perform a continuing loop in conjunction with its data collection loop of steps <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. This loop begins with a step <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> of comparing the presently read blood pressure with a value as presently set using the set alarm function of step <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The microprocessor proceeds to determine whether the blood pressure value is outside the set range at step <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. If the blood pressure is outside the set range at step <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> then it proceeds to end the loop, which will be repeated each time a blood pressure reading is taken. If the microprocessor determines at step <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> that the blood pressure is outside the set range then it proceeds to step <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> to activate an alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> While a particular embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications of the present invention may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects.
