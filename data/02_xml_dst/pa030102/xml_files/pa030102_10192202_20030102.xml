<heading lvl="1">INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to devices for delivering a liquid product. The invention has particular application in areas where long term and controlled release of a liquid product is required, the product being dispensed or dispersed by evaporation, such as in an air freshener or insecticide, or into a flow of other dispersing liquid such as in toilet systems, particularly systems which have an intermittent flow of the dispersing liquid. The invention is particularly concerned with delivering a liquid product such as a perfume, surfactant, bleach or disinfectant, particularly in the form of a solution, dispersion or suspension, and for delivering it to a toilet bowl under the action of water used to flush the toilet bowl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It has been known for a long time to provide so-called toilet automatics in the form of a solid or semi-solid product, a &lsquo;rim block&rsquo;, to be mounted within the inner rim of a water closet bowl where the flushing water will wash over the product and so dissolve or erode it to release active constituents into the water flow. Blocks may also be placed on top of the cistern, in Japanese style systems where water from a tap flows over the block and then into the cistern, and also may be placed within the cistern below the water level, where they slowly release constituents into the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> More recently, it has been proposed to use a liquid toilet freshening product in a similar manner, a so-called liquid rim product. For example, EP-A-0538957 describes a device that can be mounted on the inner rim of a water closet bowl to dose a liquid freshening product into the flushing water. In this device, the liquid product is dosed into the water flow from a porous substrate, a delivery plate, which is disposed in the path of the flushing water. The porous substrate is supplied with the liquid product from a container disposed above the substrate, a mouth at the bottom of the reservoir opening onto the upper surface of the substrate. Although this arrangement is simple in construction, it suffers from the drawback that the volume of liquid product that flows to the substrate between flushes is not consistent over the life time of the product, which is typically intended to be 3 to 4 weeks. Dosing seems to depend at least in part, on the head of liquid in the container, since this directly influences the rate of flow from the container onto the surface of the substrate. The container is sealed above the opening, and so a reduced pressure is created above the liquid as it flows onto the substrate. The result is an inconsistency in the dose of liquid product into the toilet bowl over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> EP-A-07853 15 describes a development of the device discussed above. The same basic principle of delivering a liquid product into a flow of water from a porous substrate is employed. However, liquid product from a container is deposited onto the upper surface of the substrate via a regulating channel. The liquid is metered into the channel through an orifice and a separate air opening to the interior of the container is provided. The sizes of the metering orifice and the air opening are strictly regulated to the viscosity of the liquid being dosed. This is described as having the effect of providing a substantially constant &lsquo;head&rsquo; of the liquid above the substrate, independent of the level in the container, although the height of liquid in the container necessarily reduces over time. Although this arrangement provides a more consistent flow rate of liquid product to the absorbent substrate, inconsistent delivery to the flushing water can still result, dependent at least in part on the duration of the periods between flushes. This is thought to be due to the reliance of this device on coagulation of the liquid product to stem its flow onto the substrate, a mechanism which is very dependent on the environment in which the device is operated. It is also thought that the head of liquid bearing down on the substrate can lead to &lsquo;supersaturation&rsquo; of the substrate, so it becomes over loaded with product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> WO 99/66139 and WO 99/66140 describe numerous variations of the liquid rim product, including different styles of delivery plate in place of the porous plate of EP-A-0 538 957, while WO 00/42261 describes yet another product using a grooved plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> All of the systems still use the same basic idea of delivering liquid directly from the container&apos;s mouth onto the delivery plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also well known are perfume delivery systems in which a container of liquid is open at its top, as described in EP-A-669137. A wick in the liquid feeds the liquid up to a felt or other porous pad to create a larger surface area of liquid, from which the perfume can evaporate into the ambient atmosphere. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is one object of the present invention to provide a device which can introduce a substantially consistent dose of a liquid product to the delivery plate as the container empties over time </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention provides a liquid delivery device comprising a container for the liquid, the container having an outlet at a lower end thereof, and a cup surrounding a mouth of the container outlet, the cup being open to the atmosphere, whereby in use liquid flows from the container into the cup until the container mouth is covered by liquid in the cup, a reduced pressure being created above the liquid in the container and preventing further flow of liquid into the cup, wherein dispersal means is provided to disperse the liquid from the cup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably the dispersal means comprises a capillary based arrangement for transporting liquid from the cup to a delivery plate. Liquid from the delivery plate may then evaporate into atmosphere, or be dispersed by a flow of other liquid over the plate, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The capillary may be in the form of a porous member or pliable wick such as a cellulosic or polyester wick used in air freshener devices, but preferably an arrangement of elongate capillary channels is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The cup will contain a relatively constant head of liquid. As liquid is dispersed from the cup, the liquid level in the cup falls below the level of the container mouth, at which point air can enter the container and liquid from the container flows down into the cup to replenish it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The cup may be formed as part of the container outlet. Thus another aspect of the invention provides a liquid delivery device comprising a container for the liquid, the container having an outlet at a lower end thereof, when the container is positioned for use, and a mouth of the container outlet extending upwardly, whereby the outlet forms a reservoir of liquid at the lower end of the container, and dispersal means is provided for dispersing the liquid from the outlet. Preferably the dispersal means is a capillary channel or channels for feeding the liquid to a substrate such as a plate or porous mass providing an enlarged, exposed area of liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect the invention provides a device for delivering a liquid product into a receiver in conjunction with a liquid flow into said receiver, the device comprising a substrate, which in use is exposed to said liquid flow, a cup disposed below the substrate for receiving liquid product from a container and having a free liquid level open to atmosphere, and means for transporting the liquid product from the cup upwardly to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It has been found that by supplying the liquid product in this manner, the product dose can be maintained substantially consistent, independent of factors such as the level of liquid product in the container and the time between flushes. The take-up of liquid product by the substrate is due substantially to the head of liquid in the cup and properties of the dispersal means. In particular, the supply of product to the substrate can be stopped or reduced to a negligible amount, when the substrate becomes saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The dispersal means may comprise at least one passage extending from the cup at or near its base, to the underside of the substrate. The liquid product in the cup then provides a hydrostatic head which serves to drive the liquid product at least part way up the passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The level of liquid in the cup, and hence the head it generates, may be controlled such that the product is urged upwardly through the passage up to, but preferably no higher than, its opening to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Desirably, the upward transport of the liquid product from the cup to the substrate relies at least in part on capillary action. For example, the dispersal means may include one or more capillary passages extending upwardly from the cup towards the base of the substrate, e.g. as discrete passages formed in the device or in the form of a wick extending upwardly from the cup. By relying on capillary action in this way, it has been found that the flow of liquid to the substrate is more surely stopped once the substrate becomes saturated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in a more particular aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for delivering a liquid product into a receiver in conjunction with a liquid flow into said receiver, the device comprising a substrate, which in use is exposed to said liquid flow, a cup disposed below the substrate for receiving liquid product from a reservoir and having a free liquid level open to atmosphere, and means for transporting the liquid product from the cup upwardly to the substrate, said transport means comprising one or more capillary passages opening onto the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, to rely solely on capillary action to lift the product to the substrate may be impractical, particularly if it is necessary to lift the liquid through anything other than a small height. This is because the small cross-sectional passage required to give greater capillary lift may reduce the flow rate of the product through the passage to such an extent that the porous substrate is not replenished fully between flushes. It is therefore particularly preferred to use a combination of hydrostatic pressure and capillary action to transport the liquid product to the substrate. In this way, the capillary rise required can be kept to a minimum, since it is only necessary to rely on capillary forces to lift the liquid to the substrate from the level it is taken to by the hydrostatic forces acting on it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Thus, in a preferred form of the invention, one or more passages are provided which extend from the cup, at or near its base, to the substrate, at least an upper portion of the or each passage having a cross-sectional area sufficiently small to create the desired capillary action. The actual cross-sectional area of this upper portion can be selected based on the properties of the liquid product and the capillary rise necessary to transport the liquid to the substrate.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is adapted for delivery a liquid product, such as a cleansing and/or deodorising product into the bowl <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a water closet, in conjunction with the flow of water F generated when the water closet is flushed. The device comprises a porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is supported on a generally horizontal platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to form a delivery plate in the path of the flushing water F. A container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, mounted on the device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> above the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, serves as a reservoir for the liquid product <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is fed under the influence of gravity to a cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> disposed below the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The liquid product <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is transported upwardly from the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to dose the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the device also includes a strap via which it can be suspended from the rim of the water closet bowl (much in the same way as a conventional &lsquo;rim block&rsquo;), and may be surrounded by a cage-like structure to offer some protection to the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Looking at the device in more detail, it has a base <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of polypropylene, for example, which includes the circular cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a rectangular platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which surrounds and extends outwardly from the mouth of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set centrally in the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in its lateral dimension, but is offset towards the front of the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in order that, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> substantial part of the rear of the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can protrude below the rim 20 of the water closet bowl 4 to deflect a greater volume of flushing water over the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As seen most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of generally radially extending channels <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed in the upper surface of the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which serve to encourage the flow of flushing water outwardly from the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, to carry the liquid product into the water closet bowl <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and to quickly drain excess flushing water away from the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the flushing flow ceases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> itself is annular in configuration and is supported on the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to surround and slightly overlap the open mouth of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Any of a number of different materials may be used for the porous substrate, the particular form of material being selected based on the application to which it will be put, to provide the desired absorption and flushing out of the liquid product whilst not retaining too great a volume of the flowing liquid into which it is dosed. For instance, where the flowing liquid is water, as in the embodiment described, a material with hydrophobic properties is preferred. One satisfactory material for use in a flow of flushing water has been found to be a high density polyethylene (HDPE) having a pore size of about 45-90 &mgr;m and a pore volume of about 40-50%, available from Porex Technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A cylindrical, tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is received snugly in the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the lower end of this insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> being butted against the base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and its upper end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> protruding from the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> protrudes radially outwardly from the wall of the insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, just above the mouth of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being trapped between this flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to secure it in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Supported concentrically within the insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a horizontal partition <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which forms an outlet of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, providing a conduit from above the partition <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to below the partition for a supply of liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the inner volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is circumscribed by the base 26 of the cup and the wall of the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the partition <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, surrounding the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, there are a plurality of through apertures <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) by which the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is vented to atmosphere. The delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> terminates in the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a position below these apertures or air vents <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An annular shoulder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed in the outside of the wall of the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at its base, so that when the insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located in the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> an annular gallery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed around the circumference of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Of course, the shoulder can be supplemented or substituted by a circumferential channel formed in the side wall of the cup to provide this gallery. The gallery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the inside of the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by way of a series of openings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through the wall of the insert, in this example in the form of notches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> around its base. Liquid product can therefore pass through these openings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the from the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the circumferential gallery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Extending upwardly from the gallery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, between the outer surface of the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are a series of passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, spaced circumferentially around the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. These passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> open at their upper ends, at the mouth of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, to the underside of the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have a cross-sectional area which, at least in upper portions thereof adjacent the mouth of the cup, is sufficiently small to create a capillary rise of the liquid product within the passage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. For reasons that will become apparent below, the capillary portion of each passage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends down at least as far as the level to which the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> protrudes into the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be formed, for example, by generally vertically extending channels formed in one or both of the opposed surfaces of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or helical channels if a longer length of passage is desired. Alternatively, rather than providing a series of discrete passages, it would be possible simply to rely on a predetermined annular spacing between the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Suitable projections could, for example, be formed on the one or both of the opposed faces of the cup and insert to maintain the desired spacing all around. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rigid, or at least semi-rigid, so that it does not collapse as it empties. It is separable from the tubular insert <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in order that it can be easily refilled, or more typically replaced; that is to say &lsquo;refill&rsquo; containers can be provided much in the same way as replacement &lsquo;rim blocks&rsquo; are provided for the &lsquo;toilet fresheners&rsquo; referred to in the introduction. The overall shape of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is largely immaterial, but a slim configuration is preferred so as not to project too far across the water closet bowl <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. If desired, the walls of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be transparent, so that the amount of liquid product remaining can be easily ascertained. The product may be coloured to make this determination of level even easier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in its bottom wall with a downwardly depending neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the container is, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, initially closed by a seal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> secured over the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. To mount the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the delivery device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pushed down onto the upper end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A recessed, circular central portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the seal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is contacted and broken by the upper end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is formed at an angle, so that the seal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is broken with a shearing action from one side of the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the other. The outside diameter of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the inside diameter of the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, with the remaining portion of the seal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> thereon, are selected to provide an effective seal between these parts. This type of construction is well known in liquid rim devices. Thus, the only path by which fluid can escape from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is through the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the device a clearance is maintained between the outer circumference of the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the wall of the insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order that the air vents <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the partition <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not blocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The device can be used for delivery of a variety of liquid products into a liquid flow. Typically, for the exemplary application described-cleansing and deodorising a water closet bowl-the product will include both surfactant and perfume components. The rheological behaviour of the material, in particular its viscosity, can be selected with regard to the physical properties of the substrate material, to ensure that the product can be absorbed quickly into and retained within the substrate, whilst at least a surface layer of the product can readily be flushed from the substrate by the liquid flow into which the product is dosed. Normally, the liquid product will be more viscous than the flowing liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The operation of the device will now be explained. When the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is initially installed on the device liquid product flows from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> down through the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Initially the liquid escaping from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be replaced by air, which enters the container via apertures <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When the liquid in the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> covers the lower end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the passage of air to the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is cut off. This in turn causes a drop in pressure in the free space <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> above the liquid in the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a small amount of liquid continues to flow into the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A state of equilibrium is rapidly reached in which the head of liquid in the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is exposed to atmospheric pressure via the vents <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, supports the liquid in the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the flow of liquid to the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> stops with the liquid level a little way above the mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. If the level of liquid in the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> drops below the mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, air can flow into the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the flow from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> commences once more. In this way, the free liquid level in the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is maintained substantially constant at or around the mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the delivery tube <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The liquid product flows from the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, through the notches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> around the base of the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, into the circumferential gallery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the base of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. From there, primarily under the influence of the hydrostatic forces, the fluid rises up the passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> between the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the tubular insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a level corresponding to the liquid level in the well <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The liquid is then dispersed from the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The liquid completes its upward passage to the underside of the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, through the upper, capillary portions of the passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by virtue of capillary forces. From the upper end of the passages the liquid is then absorbed into the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, spreading through the area of the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The liquid product continues to flow from the volume 14 into the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being topped up from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as necessary, until the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> becomes saturated. Once this happens, the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> ceases to draw liquid away from the top ends of the passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the capillary flow through the upper portions of the passages stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the water closet is flushed, water flows down onto and over the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> supported on it. The liquid product dose is flushed out of the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by this flow of water and delivered to the water closet bowl <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Once the flow of flushing water stops, and excess water has drained away, the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is refilled with the liquid product by the process described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A small amount of water tends to be retained on the surface of the substrate. As this water evaporates it has been found to release the perfume component of the liquid product, providing a deodorising effect between flushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Unlike the prior art described above, since with the device of this invention there is no head of liquid acting from above the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, no additional liquid is absorbed once the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is saturated. Consequently, the dose of liquid supplied can be relatively accurately and consistently controlled by selection of the properties of the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in particular its absorbency and its physical dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to inhibit the flow of flush water into the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as this will reduce the viscosity of liquid in the cup, and so affect the action dispersal mechanism, namely capillaries <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an upper end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which forms a protective collar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Various modifications can be made from the specifically described example without departing from the invention. For example, the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> supporting the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be dispensed with, or more preferably lowered, if the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is sufficiently rigid to support itself (or alternative support means are provided), the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being secured between the flange on the tubular insert and the top of the cup. In this way, flushing water can be directed over both the upper and lower surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which forms the delivery plate per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> show a second, preferred embodiment of the invention in which the porous substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment is replaced by capillary grooves formed in the upper surface of the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to form a delivery plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Various modifications are made to the cup arrangement <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in particular to enable the capillary passages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to deliver liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on to the upper surface of the plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown only at its outlet region, but is closed at its upper part as for the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is integrally formed with substantially flat delivery plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> forming an enlarged area adjacent the cup. A prong <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> extends up from the bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; to displace the seal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the closure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Closure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; has inner and outer walls <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which are joined by a web <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and embrace the neck <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a liquid tight seal. The closure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; has a connecting portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which extends away from the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to define a mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Seal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is held at lip <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; on the inner rim of web <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, prior to being displaced by prong <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> To form the capillary system for transporting liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the inner volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a grooved insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided. It can be seen that insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and connecting portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> perform a similar function to insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a side view of insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which comprises a circular cross-section cylinder wall <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with a radially extending collar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> at its upper end. Cylinder <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a snug fit in the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Smooth walled capillary grooves <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are formed in the outer surface of cylinder <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> around the complete periphery (only three are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). At the lower end of each capillary <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, notches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; extend completely through the cylinder wall <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, similar to notches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-section through the insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on a diameter. It can be seen that capillaries <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extend up into the collar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and across the underside <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Thus, referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the capillaries form a passage for liquid from volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, up between insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the wall of cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, to the upper surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&prime; of plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The upper surface of the collar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is recessed at <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to provide an air gap around the cap <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime;. It will be appreciated that a support or guide will also be provided to support container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in position and this may be in the form of a surrounding cage structure as known in the art. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the upper surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&prime; of the plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with capillary grooves <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in the surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&prime;, extending away from the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The operation of the device of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is similar to the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted over the prong <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to displace seal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> flows into volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, through notches <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; and rises up capillaries <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The liquid in volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> reaches a level L just above mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime;, when it is balanced by the partial vacuum created in container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, the liquid in capillaries <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will rise further, because of the capillary action, until it moves onto the surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> where it is conducted away in capillary channels <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As with the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it can be seen that the flow of liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on to plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is substantially independent of the amount of liquid remaining in container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is governed by the liquid level L in cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the capillary action generated by capillaries <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As level L falls below mouth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime;, air can enter container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to allow more liquid to fall into volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The cross-section of the capillaries <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can be modified to suit the viscosity of the liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a more viscous liquid requiring a larger capillary size as the rate of flow of the liquid through a given capillary is slower for a more viscous liquid. Also, the number of capillaries can be adjusted. It is desirable to ensure sufficient liquid flow to replenish the dosage delivered to porous member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or plate surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&prime; within about 30 seconds to 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An experiment was conducted to illustrate the effect of viscosity of the liquid on the vertical flow of liquid in a capillary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Two glass plates were spaced apart from an amount &ldquo;d&rdquo; and dipped into a typical formulation shown in Table 1, adjusted for viscosity. The height reached by the liquid after 10 minutes was noted, and the results are shown in Table 2.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> embodiment could be used to deliver liquid to a porous member, such as members <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, in place of a capillary system for delivering liquid upwards from, cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, liquid could be dispensed from the bottom of the cup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows schematically a system in which the bottom wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by a porous plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which extends beyond the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to form a delivery plate. Liquid will be drawn from the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the exposed region <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the plate, where flush water can wash liquid from the plate. A non-porous cover <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is provided below the region of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to prevent liquid dripping straight through the plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The head L of liquid above the plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will be substantially constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, The cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a conduit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The container is inverted over a vertical arm <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the conduit <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, resting on a flange <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Liquid flows into the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> until the horizontal passage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the conduit is filled, preventing air returning into the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An insert <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> forms a capillary passage <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with the wall of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, to conduct liquid <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> up to a porous substrate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which is supported at the mouth of the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on a plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The volume <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is open to atmosphere through a tube <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which also serves to inhibit the flow of flush water into the cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that insert <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> could also be used with this embodiment to deliver liquid on to the top of porous plate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or a grooved plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Various modifications will be apparent to those in the art and it is desired to include all such modifications as fall within the scope of the accompanying claims. For example, the porous substrate may be a self supporting plate, preferably substantially flat and providing an enlarged area adjacent the cup for dispersal of the liquid. In place of the capillaries and porous substrate or grooved delivery plate another wicking system may be used to disperse the liquid from the cup. </paragraph>
