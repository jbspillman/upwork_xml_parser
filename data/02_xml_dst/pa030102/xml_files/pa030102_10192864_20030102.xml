<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for a surface-protective film, more particularly to a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition employed for a surface-protective film for protecting metal surfaces, glass surfaces, coating surfaces, etc. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional methods for protecting surfaces of top coatings formed as finish coatings on the surfaces of vehicles include coating thinly with paraffin wax. However, this method involves a problem in that the paraffin wax coating does not exhibit sufficient protecting function and that it costs much time and labor when the paraffin wax coating is to be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, Japanese Patent Publication No. 74627/1993 discloses a method of applying a plastic film having a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer to an adherend. According to this method, the above problems can be solved. In this case, however, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is based on a hydrogenated block copolymer of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon, so that the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer exhibits poor adhesion and poor removability against adherends and that the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer leaves stains of the adherends or leaves thereon traces of the films removed, disadvantageously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the present invention is to provide a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for surface-protective films which is caused to exhibit excellent adhesion to adherends, not to smear the adherends nor to leave traces thereon when the films are removed from the adherends and can also impart excellent removability to surf ace-protective films. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for a surface-protective film, the composition comprising </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 40% by weight or more of a hydrogenated random copolymer consisting of 1 to 50% by weight of styrene and 99 to 50% by weight of a diene type hydrocarbon, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 60% by weight or less of a tackifier resin and/or a softener. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be explained below specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The hydrogenated random copolymer consisting of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon employable according to the present invention preferably has a styrene content of 1 to 50% by weight and a melt flow rate (ASTM D1238, hereinafter abbreviated as MFR) of 2 to 10 g/10 minutes at 230&deg; C. under a load of 2.16 kg. If the styrene content is less than 1% by weight, the resulting resin comes to have poor thermoplasticity, whereas if it is more than 50% by weight, the resulting copolymer comes to exhibit poor adhesion to adherends and to have an increased modulus of elasticity and reduced compatibility with the tackifier resin or the softener, so that such random copolymers having styrene contents not within the specified range are not preferred as components of pressure-sensitive adhesives for surface-protective films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The diene type hydrocarbon to be employed as a comonomer includes, for example, isoprene and butadiene, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Tackifier resins employable include petroleum aliphatic resins, alicyclic resins, rosin resins, terpene resins, etc., particularly preferably hydrogenated resins thereof in view of weathering resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Softening agents employable include oils, paraffin waxes, low-molecular weight polybutenes, low-molecular weight polyisoprenes, stearic acid, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition, if the amount of hydrogenated random copolymer consisting of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon is less than 40% by weight and the amount of tackifier resin or the softener is more than 60% by weight, the resulting composition comes to exhibit poor adhesion to adherends and smears them or leave traces thereon, unpractically, when surface-protective films are removed from the adherend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for surface-protective films of the present invention may, as necessary, be incorporated with a filler or a lubricant such as talc, stearic acid amide and calcium stearate; a pigment or a dye such as titanium dioxide; a reinforcing material, for example, inorganic hollow particles such as glass balloon and silica balloon; a microspherical polymer, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, an ultraviolet stabilizer, etc., so long as the objective of the present invention is not impaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Base materials employable in the surface-protective films having the pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention include known plastic films such as of a polyethylene film, a polypropylene film, a polyester film, nylon and polyvinyl chloride; or such films incorporated with a filler or a pigment such as talc, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide by means of kneading; and paper, fabric and printed matters thereof.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the case of the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition containing less than 40% by weight of the hydrogenated random copolymer consisting of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon like in Comparative Example 1, it showed poor adhesion to the adherends and it also smeared the adherends and left traces of the films removed, so that such pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions are not suitable as pressure-sensitive adhesives for surface-protective films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition containing the hydrogenated block copolymer consisting of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon as an elastomer component like in Comparative Example 2, it showed poor adhesion to the adherends and it also showed poor removability after the carbon arc irradiation, left stains of the adherends and left traces when the films were removed, so that such pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions are not suitable as pressure-sensitive adhesives for surface-protective films. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for surface-protective films according to the present invention is caused to exhibit excellent adhesion to adherends, not to leave stains of the adherends nor to leave traces thereon when the films are removed from the adherends, because of the hydrogenated random copolymer consisting of styrene and a diene type hydrocarbon incorporated as an elastomer component, and can also impart excellent removability to surface-protective films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In other words, since surface-protective films employing the pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention exhibit excellent adhesion to coating films, stainless steel sheets, glass plates, etc. and also show excellent removability after carbon arc irradiation, the films can be applied to and removed from adherends easily and can also be used repeatedly. In addition, these films have excellent properties as surface-protective films since they do not leave stains of adherends nor leave traces after they are removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, since the pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention are thermoplastic, they can be applied to base materials by means of melt extrusion using a T-die or extrusion coating as well as melt spread-coating. Further, if a base material of a thermoplastic composition is selected, a surface-protective film can be formed by a single step by co-extruding hot melts of raw material resins. Accordingly, the step of forming a film on the base material and the step of applying the pressure-sensitive adhesive to the base material can be carried out simultaneously. </paragraph>
