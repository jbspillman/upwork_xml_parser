<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a proton conducting polymer, a method for producing the same, a solid polymer electrolyte and an electrode. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, fuel cells have occupied an important position as next generation type clean energy sources. Above all, a solid polymer electrolyte type fuel cell is one in which both anode and cathode electrodes are each arranged across a solid polymer electrolyte membrane intervening therebetween. For example, in the case of a direct methanol type fuel cell (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;DMFC&rdquo;) in which methanol is used as a fuel, methanol is supplied to the anode side, and oxygen or air to the cathode side, thereby allowing electrochemical reaction to occur to generate electricity. Solid polymer electrolyte membranes having high proton conductivity have been developed for retaining the characteristics of their high output and high energy density, and for obtaining small-sized, lightweight fuel cells. The solid polymer electrolyte membrane used in the DMFC is required to have the barrier property to fuel methanol, that is to say, reduced permeability (cross-over) of fuel methanol from the anode side of the membrane to the cathode side thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Previously, hydrated membranes of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers such as Nafion (trade name) manufactured by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company) have generally been used as the solid polymer electrolyte membranes. The structure of Nafion is represented by the following general formula (I):

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned hydrated membranes of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers have high proton conductivity, and the proton conductivity is exhibited by the generation of a channel structure caused by hydration (conduction of hydrated protons). That is to say, the conduction of protons takes place through water as a medium in the hydrated membranes of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers, and a specified amount of water exists in the hydrated membranes. Accordingly, methanol having high affinity with water easily passes through the membranes, so that the hydrated membranes of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers have a limitation with regard to the methanol barrier property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Besides, as a polymer having proton conductivity independent of water, polybenzimidazole (PBI) doped with a strong acid such as phosphoric acid (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;acid-doped PBI&rdquo;) is known. Specifically, PBI includes poly-&lsqb;2,2&prime;-(m-phenylene)-5,5&prime;-bibenzimidazole&rsqb; represented by the following general formula (II):

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With respect to the conduction mechanism of the above-mentioned acid-doped PBI membrane, it is said that proton hopping occurs through acids coordinated to N&mdash;H groups contained in PBI, a base polymer, and that the proton hopping does not accompany movement of water. Then, the acid-doped PBI membranes have been expected to be significantly low in the cross-over amount of methanol, and excellent in methanol barrier property. However, the acid-doped PBI membranes have the disadvantage that elimination of dopants such as inorganic acids is liable to occur in an atmosphere of water/methanol (liquid fuel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have previously invented acid-doped PBI membranes in which dopant elimination is difficult to occur, and which are excellent in methanol barrier property by using diphenylphosphoric acid as a dopant in an amount of one molecule per N-H group in PBI (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-38472). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For improving the proton conductivity of the above-mentioned acid-doped PBI membranes, it is preferred that the N&mdash;H group density of the base polymers is increased and that the density of acid components coordinated to the N&mdash;H groups is increased. Further, for conducting protons in the solid polymer electrolyte membranes, the base polymers preferably have a low glass transition temperature (Tg) and a flexible molecular structure. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of chemical stability required for the solid polymer electrolyte membranes used in fuel cells, the proton conducting polymers are preferably aromatic polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> PBI that has hitherto been used as the acid-doped PBI membranes has imidazole rings, and two nitrogen atoms having unshared electron pairs exist in each imidazole ring. One nitrogen atom exists as an N&mdash;H group, and the other nitrogen atom constitutes a double bond. The unshared electron pair of the nitrogen atom constituting the double bond contribute to the formation of a &pgr; electron resonance structure of the imidazole ring. However, the unshared electron pair of the nitrogen atom of the N&mdash;H group of the imidazole ring is kept free. It is therefore presumed that the substantial electron arrangement of the nitrogen atom of the N&mdash;H group of the imidazole ring approximates to the electron arrangement of a nitrogen atom of an N&mdash;H group connecting two aromatic rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A polymer having such an N&mdash;H group connecting two aromatic rings is a polyaniline. The molecular structure thereof is simpler than that of PBI, and the N&mdash;H group density thereof is high. The polyanilines include a polyaniline in which aromatic rings are bonded at the para-positions (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;para type polyaniline&rdquo;), and a polyaniline in which aromatic rings are bonded at the meta-positions (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;meta type polyaniline&rdquo;). The para type polyaniline has a &pgr; conjugate structure, so that itself has electrical conductivity. Accordingly, although an acid-doped para type polyaniline obtained by doping the para type polyaniline with an acid component shows proton conductivity, it can not be used as a material for the solid polymer electrolyte membrane used in the fuel cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the meta type polyaniline can not have a &pgr; conjugate structure, so that it can not exhibit electrical conductivity as it is. Further, synthesis thereof is difficult, and therefore only a few examples of electrolytic polymerization of aniline under special conditions are reported for synthesis methods thereof &lsqb;T. Ohsaka et al., <highlight><italic>J. Electroanal. Chem., </italic></highlight>161, 399 (1984), A. Volkov et al., <highlight><italic>J. Electroanal. Chem., </italic></highlight>115, 279 (1980), and Onuki, Matsuda and Koyama, <highlight><italic>Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, </italic></highlight>11, 1801 (1984)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, the meta type polyaniline has proton selective permeability (proton conductivity). Accordingly, there is an example in which it is evaluated as a PH sensor usable in metal ion-containing solutions &lsqb;Onuki, Matsuda and Koyama, <highlight><italic>Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, </italic></highlight>11, 1801 (1984)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The meta type polyaniline has a flexible molecular structure, compared with the above-mentioned para type polyaniline. From the above, the meta type polyaniline having no electrical conductivity and having the flexible molecular structure is anticipated to exhibit the proton conductivity by acid doping, and to be applied as a novel solid polymer electrolyte material for fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as an electrode used in a solid polymer electrolyte type fuel cell, a so-called MEA (membrane electrode assembly) is known. In the MEA, electrodes are formed of fine noble metal catalyst particles supported on carbon, a solid polymer electrolyte component formed on surfaces of the fine catalyst particles, and a fluorine resin for adhering the fine catalyst particles to one another. The electrodes are each arranged on two main planes of a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, thereby constituting a fuel cell (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 5-36418). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is also conceivable that the above-mentioned acid-doped polyaniline (hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;acid-doped polyaniline&rdquo;), that is to say, the proton conducting polymer, is used as the solid polymer electrolyte component formed on the surfaces of the fine catalyst particles, when it is high in proton conductivity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The meta type polyaniline is produced, for example, by the following method. That is to say, aniline is dissolved in 1 to 100 parts by volume, preferably 5 to 50 parts by volume per part by volume of aniline of an organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and an oxidizing agent such as ammonium peroxodisulfate is added thereto in an amount of 90 to 130 mole percent based on aniline, at &minus;20&deg; C. to 50&deg; C., preferably at &minus;5&deg; C. to 0&deg; C., all at once or for 30 minutes to 72 hours, more preferably for 12 hours to 24 hours. The resulting solution is stirred overnight while gradually lowering the temperature of the solution to room temperature. Then, the reaction solution is poured into a large excess of deionized water to obtain a solid material.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The molecular weight of the meta type polyaniline obtained depends on the time taken to add the oxidizing agent. For example, when the concentration of aniline contained in the reaction solution is 6.7% by volume, addition of the oxidizing agent all at once gives a inherent viscosity (&eegr;<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>) of 0.07, addition thereof for 6 hours gives a inherent viscosity (&eegr;<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>) of 0.13, and addition thereof for 12 hours gives a inherent viscosity (&eegr;<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>) of 0.22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, the molecular weight of the meta type polyaniline also depends on the solution concentration. For example, when the oxidizing agent is added for 12 hours, a concentration of aniline in the reaction solution of 6.7% by volume gives a inherent viscosity (&eegr;<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>) of 0.22, and a concentration of 13.3% by volume gives a inherent viscosity (&eegr;<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>) of 1.14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When water is used in the polymerization reaction of the meta type polyaniline, the PH of the reaction solution is kept preferably at 7 or more (under neutral to alkaline conditions), and more preferably at 10 to 14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the PH of the reaction solution is less than 7, the formation of the para type polyaniline increases to generate electrical conductivity, therefore becoming inadequate for the solid polymer electrolyte membrane application. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The use of the organic phosphoric acid compounds as the dopants decreases the water absorption of the solid polymer electrolyte membranes comprising the proton conducting polymers of the invention lower than before the doping, resulting no occurrence of wrinkles caused by water absorption even in the presence of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Usually, the doping is carried out by the following three methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (1) A method of blending a polymer with a dopant (acid component) in a solvent in which the polymer, the dopant and an acid-doped polymer obtained by doping the polymer with the acid component are all soluble to conduct film formation and doping at the same time (solution blend method); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (2) A method of immersing a polymer film in a dopant solution (immersing method); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (3) A method of bringing a polymer solution into contact with a dopant solution at an interface to conduct film formation and doping at the same time (interfacial coagulation method). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For the doping for preparing the proton conducting polymers of the invention, the above-mentioned (1) solution blend method is particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the solvents used in the solution blend method are required to dissolve not only the polyanilines and the dopants, but also the acid-doped polymers produced. For this reason, the solvents such as NMP and DMSO used as the solvents for the polyanilines can not be used because of very low solubility of the acid-doped polyanilines (proton conducting polymers) produced therein. The acid-doped polyanilines produced are dissolved only in strong acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid. However, it is difficult to treat these strong acids after film formation. Consequently, the solvent used in the solution blend method is preferably trifluoroacetic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the solution blend method, the temperature at which the polyanilines are dissolved in the solvents is from room temperature to 200&deg; C., and preferably from 40&deg; C. to 120&deg; C. The concentration of the polyanilines contained in the solutions is form 1% to 50% by weight, and preferably from 5% to 30% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The solution blend method has the advantage that the organic phosphoric acid compounds, preferred-dopants in the invention, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the solution blend method, a polyaniline powder is dissolved in the solvent such as trifluoroacetic acid at the above-mentioned temperature, and then, a specified amount of the dopant is added thereto, followed by stirring at room temperature. After stirring overnight, the homogenized solution is cast on a sheet such as a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheet. Then the solvent is removed at 0&deg; C. to 100&deg; C., preferably at about 40&deg; C., at ordinary pressure, followed by vacuum drying at room temperature to 200&deg; C., preferably at about 80&deg; C. The thickness of the resulting polyaniline film is usually from 10 &mgr;m to 200 &mgr;m, and preferably from 30 &mgr;m to 150 &mgr;m. The dope amount can be calculated from the charged amount ratio of the polyaniline to the dopant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When the strong acids are used as the dopants, the immersing method can also be used. The strong acids have high affinity for water and methanol, so that highly concentrated dopant solutions can be easily prepared. For example, when PBI is used as the polymer and phosphoric acid is used as the dopant, a methanol solution having a phosphoric acid concentration of about 80% by weight is used as the dopant solution for conducting doping with 5 molecules of phosphoric acid per repeating structure unit of PBI. The immersing method requires such highly concentrated dopant solutions, so that it can not be employed as the doping method in the invention, except for the case that the strong acids are used as the dopants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For preparing polyaniline films used in the immersing method, polyaniline solutions are first prepared. Solvents for preparing the polyaniline solutions include, for example, NMP, DMSO, DMAc and DMF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The polyaniline solution is prepared usually at room temperature to 200&deg; C., preferably at room temperature to 120&deg; C. Usually, for homogeneously dissolving the polyaniline, the solution is heated below the boiling point of the solvent, stirred to dissolve the polyaniline, and cooled to room temperature. Then, the solution is adjusted so as to give a viscosity of 50 to 4,000 poises, preferably 400 to 600 poises, at 30&deg; C. The viscosity of the above-mentioned polyaniline solution depends on the temperature, and the degree of polymerization and solution concentration of the polyaniline. In general, when the viscosity of the polyaniline solution is less than 50 poises, film formation itself is difficult. On the other hand, exceeding 4,000 poises results in too high viscosity, which makes it difficult to prepare homogeneous films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The polymer solution thus obtained can be cast on, for example, glass plates, and the solvent is removed by an ordinary method to prepare polyaniline films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the resulting polyaniline film is usually from 10 &mgr;m to 200 &mgr;m, and preferably from 50 &mgr;m to 150 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Solvents for the dopant solutions include tetrahydrofuran (THF), water, methanol, ethanol, n-hexane and methylene chloride. In this case, the concentration of the dopant solution is from 10% to 95% by weight, and preferably from 50% to 90% by weight. When the concentration is less than 10% by weight, the dope amount is decreased to cause reduced proton conductivity of the resulting dope film. On the other hand, exceeding 95% by weight results in dissolution of the polyaniline film in the dopant solution. The dopant solution is prepared at room temperature, at which usually, the dopant is easily homogeneously dissolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the immersing method, the polyaniline films formed from the polyaniline solution as described are immersed in the dopant solution at room temperature for 5 to 72 hours, followed by vacuum drying at room temperature to 200&deg; C., preferably at 40&deg; C. to 80&deg; C. Then, the dope amount is calculated from an increase in weight from before doping to after doping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the organic phosphoric acid compounds are used as the dopants in the immersing method, the conductivity of the resulting acid-doped polyanilines (proton conducting polymers) is lowered, because the acid dissociation constant of the organic phosphoric acid compounds is low. Further, the organic phosphoric acid compounds are large in size as the dopants, so that diffusion thereof inside the polyanilines is anticipated to be difficult. Furthermore, different from the strong acids, the organic phosphoric acid compounds are low in the solubility in solvents, and it is therefore difficult to obtain the highly concentrated solutions required for the dopant solutions. In the invention, therefore, the solution blend method is preferably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described above, the proton conducting polymers of the invention are obtained by doping the polyanilines with the acid components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The proton conductivity of the proton conducting polymers is measured, using the vacuum-dried proton conducting polymer films as samples, as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Complex impedance measurements are made with an impedance analyzer &ldquo;YHP 4192A&rdquo; manufactured by YOKOGAWA-HEWLETT PACKARD, LTD. in a dried state at 750 mV, using four terminals or two terminals. The direct current component R is read from Cole-Cole plots, and the proton conductivity can be calculated therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The proton conductivity of a proton conducting polymer obtained by doping the meta type polyaniline with 0.75 molecule per repeating unit of diphenylphosphoric acid by the solution blend method is from 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2.5 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;1.8 </superscript></highlight>S/cm at 75&deg; C. to 126&deg; C. On the other hand, the proton conductivity of conventional acid-doped PBI obtained by doping PBI with 1.0 molecule per N&mdash;H group of diphenylphosphoric acid is from 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3.5 </superscript></highlight>to 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2.8 </superscript></highlight>S/cm at 75&deg; C. to 126&deg; C. As can be seen from above, the proton conducting polymer of the invention shows excellent proton conductivity, compared with conventional acid-doped PBI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The proton conducting polymers of the invention can be formed into the solid polymer electrolyte membranes used in fuel cells, particularly in DMFCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The proton conducting polymer films obtained by the above-mentioned solution blend method or immersing method can be used as the solid polymer electrolyte membranes for fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The methanol barrier property of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane is measured in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> That is to say, the solid polymer electrolyte membrane having an area of 9 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is incorporated into a fuel cell to partition the cell into an anode chamber and a cathode chamber, and the cell is sealed. Keeping the cell temperature at 70&deg; C., a 1 M aqueous solution of methanol pressurized to 0.5 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is supplied into the anode chamber at 0.5 ml/minute. Dry air is allowed to flow in the cathode chamber on the opposite side through an inlet at ordinary pressure, and a membrane-permeated material is collected with a cold trap of liquid nitrogen from a gas exhausted through an outlet. The permeation amount of methanol (g/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) is calculated from the weight of the collected material (membrane-permeated material) and the composition determined by gas chromatographic analysis, which is employed as evaluation results of methanol permeability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned permeation amount of methanol of the solid polymer electrolytes of the invention is far lower than that of the conventional Nafion hydrated membranes. That is to say, the membranes comprising the solid polymer electrolytes of the invention are excellent in methanol barrier property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The proton conducting polymers of the invention can also be mixed with fine catalyst particles carried on porous particles to use the resulting products as electrodes of fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The electrodes of fuel cells usually include ones obtained by directly applying electrode paste comprising the fine catalyst particles carried on the porous particles and an alcohol solution of the solid polymer electrolyte which is an ion conductive component, onto a gaseous diffusion electrode base material, and removing the solvent. The electrode paste can also be directly applied onto the solid polymer electrolyte membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The raw materials for the fine catalyst particles include platinum and an alloy of platinum and at least one selected from the group consisting of chromium, titanium and tungsten, and platinum is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The fine catalyst particles are used in the state that they are carried on the porous particles. As the porous particles, highly structured carbon particles having large average specific surface area, which are produced by the Ketjen process or the acetylene process, are suitably used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The fine catalyst particles carried on the porous particles include a platinum catalyst carried on carbon, which is prepared by allowing carbon to support 10% to 30% by weight of platinum by a conventional method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Methods for mixing the proton conducting polymers of the invention with the fine catalyst particles carried on the porous particles (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;platinum catalyst carried on carbon&rdquo;) include, for example, a method of mixing a polyaniline-diphenylphosphoric acid blend solution obtained by the solution blend method with the platinum catalyst carried on carbon to form electrode paste to be applied onto the gaseous diffusion electrode base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, the methods for mixing the proton conducting polymers (acid-doped polyanilines) with the platinum catalysts carried on carbon also include a method of mixing the proton conducting polymer and the platinum catalyst carried on carbon with a solvent to form electrode paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As the above-mentioned solvents used in mixing the proton conducting polymers with the platinum catalyst carried on carbon by stirring, any solvents can be used as long as they disperse the porous particles well and do not deteriorate the functions of the solid polymer electrolyte membranes. For example, ethylene glycol and a 50/50% (by volume) mixture of ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether and-isopropanol are suitably used. Further, solvents unreactive to oxygen such as water, ketones and esters can be added to and mixed with them to such a degree that Theological characteristics such as the kinematic viscosity of the electrode paste for formation of electrode catalyst layers are not impaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The order of mixing the proton conducting polymer powder, the platinum catalyst carried on carbon and the solvent may be any, and can be appropriately selected. The resulting electrode paste is applied onto the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials by conventional procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Here, the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials are so-called electron conductive supports, which include, for example, carbon paper and carbon cloth. In particular, the carbon paper is a porous base material, and particularly has many pores (voids) because it is produced by the papermaking method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The gaseous diffusion electrode base materials and/or solid polymer electrolyte membranes can be coated with the electrode paste by the conventional kiss coat method, doctor blade method and screen printing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Then, the electrode paste layers applied and fixed onto the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials are heated and dried in an inert gas atmosphere to remove the organic solvents contained in the paste, thereby forming the catalyst layers comprising the platinum catalysts carried ;n carbon and the proton conducting polymers on the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In this case, nitrogen or argon can be suitably used as the inert gas. First, alcohol components are removed at 50&deg; C. to 80&deg; C. at ordinary pressure, and then, organic solvents such as ethylene glycol can be removed by heating at the same temperature under reduced pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The catalyst layers formed on the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials, which are obtained according to the above-mentioned steps, can be attached to the solid polymer electrolyte membranes by thermocompression bonding. The attachment can be suitably carried out preferably at a temperature of 120&deg; C. to 150&deg; C. at a pressure of 20 to 200 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>by hot pressing. Under the conditions of a temperature of less than 120&deg; C. and a pressure of less than 200 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the attachment is insufficient. On the other hand, under the conditions of a temperature exceeding 150&deg; C. and a pressure exceeding 200 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, there is a fear of decomposition of the proton conducting polymers. Although the hot pressing time varies with the attachment temperature and pressure, it is usually from 30 to 120 seconds. A hot pressing time of less than 30 seconds results in a fear of insufficient attachment, whereas exceeding 120 seconds results in a fear of decomposition of the proton conducting polymers, or deterioration or deformation of the gaseous diffusion electrode base materials and/or the solid polymer electrolyte membranes. </paragraph>

The amount of the proton conducting polymers that have covered the catalyst particles can be evaluated by measuring the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) absorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The solid polymer electrolytes comprising the proton conducting polymers of the invention are excellent in proton conductivity and methanol barrier property, and also very high in dope stability in aqueous solutions of methanol. They are therefore very useful as solid polymer electrolyte membrane materials for fuel cells, particularly for liquid supply type DMFCs. Further, the electrodes containing proton conducting polymers of the invention and the fine catalyst particles carried on the porous particles are high in activity, so that they are very useful as electrodes of fuel cells. </paragraph>
