<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the non-invasive detection of certain medical conditions, particularly certain sleep-state conditions, in an individual by monitoring the peripheral vascular system of the individual. The invention also relates to methods and apparatus for aiding in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition, the cause of abrupt changes in the nocturnal glucose level of a diabetic patient, and/or other disorders or conditions in the individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> PCT Applications No. PCT/IL97/00249 published Feb. 5, 1998 (International Publication No. WO 98/04182); No. PCT/IL99/00292 published Dec. 16, 1999 (WO 99/63884), No. PCT/IL00/00307 published Dec. 14, 2000 (International Publication No. WO 00/74551), No. PCT/IL00/00403 published Jan. 18, 2001 (WO 01/03569), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describe non-invasive devices for measuring blood pressure and for detecting various medical conditions, including: myocardial ischemia, certain sleep state conditions, endothelial dysfunction (ED), and stress-induced myocardial ischemia. In the preferred embodiments described in those applications, the described non-invasive devices used volume-measuring sensors and optical sensors for measuring changes in the peripheral arterial bed volume of the individual, which changes were translated to changes in the peripheral arterial tone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present application is directed to detecting certain sleep-state conditions, particularly sleep disordered breathing in an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The broad area of sleep disordered breathing encompasses a number of recognized abnormal conditions, including: the obstructive and central sleep apnea syndrome, which results in complete cessations of breathing that occur repeatedly during sleep; obstructive hypopneas, which results in partial upper airway obstruction and reduced ventilation; and the upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), which results in subtle respiratory changes even though the airflow may appear to be normal. All the foregoing conditions produce frequent awakenings and sleep fragmentation which result in impaired sleep quality and daytime functioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Even with the comprehensive battery of measurements used in laboratory based polysomnographic evaluations, the diagnosis of UARS is extremely problematical due to the difficulty in visibly scoring the subtle respiratory changes. &lsqb;Guilleminault C, Stoohs R, Clark A, Cetel M and Maistros P, &ldquo;A Cause of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness. The Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome&rdquo;, Chest 104:781-787 (1993)&rsqb;. A proper diagnosis of this syndrome necessitates the insertion of an esophageal balloon to measure the patient&apos;s intra-thoracic pressure changes. This technique causes great inconvenience and is not well tolerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A possible measurable parameter for aiding in the diagnosis of UARS may be the occurrence of frequent cortical or autonomic arousals during sleep. This may be marked by bursts of changes in the electro-encephalographic (EEG) activity, or by bursts of increased sympathetic activation. In many cases, however, there is only increased sympathetic activity with no evidence, or insufficient evidence of cortical arousal in the EEG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A simple and robust method and apparatus, capable of being used outside the confines of the sleep laboratory for monitoring the sleep state condition, and particularly for marking arousals, would be a very important diagnostic tool in the identification of what might otherwise be an unrecognizable disease state, or in determining the cause of a detected disorder. An example of the latter application described below is in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition in an adult male. Another example described below is in diagnosing and/or treating diabetic conditions of children as well as adults. Further examples are described below particularly applicable to children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With respect to the impotence application, impotence is the inability of a male to produce or maintain a penile erection such as to enable the male to have sexual intercourse. The condition may stem from organic causes or psychogenic causes. The treatment, therefore, depends to a great extent on the cause. For example, organic causes, such as a small or deformed penis, can frequently be corrected by surgery, whereas other organic causes, such as disease or other disorders, generally require treatment of the disease or disorder causing the condition. On the other hand, where the impotence has a psychogenic basis, the treatment may require the services of a sex therapist or a marriage counselor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Penile erection, or the lack thereof, during periods of REM sleep have been used to determine whether a patient&apos;s impotence may be of an organic or a psychogenic cause. Thus, it has been found that during sleep, normal fluctuations in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates blood flow to the penis, result in periodic, transient penile erections. Such nocturnal erections are substantially unaffected by an erectile dysfunction of a psychogenic origin, but are affected by such a dysfunction which is of an organic nature. A number of penile tumescence and rigidity monitoring devices have been developed and are available for monitoring nocturnal penile erections, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,188; 4,848,361 and 4,515,166, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With respect to applications for diagnosing or treating diabetic conditions, it is well known that the risk of hypoglycemia is greater during sleep than during wakefulness. Although the mechanisms underlying this increased risk are unclear, it appears they may be related to blunted counter-regulatory hormonal responses during sleep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor has been shown to measure glucose levels accurately without causing sleep disruption and allows sampling every five minutes. The subcutaneous continuous glucose determination is however an invasive measurement that requires the surgical insertion of the sensor into the subcutaneous fat of the patient&apos;s abdomen. This process is uncomfortable and carries some potential risk. As will be described more particularly below, the novel method and apparatus of the present invention may be used as a non-invasive technique to determine if a diabetic patient is experiencing rapidly changing blood glucose levels during sleep and thereby facilitate the detection of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients during sleep, provided that the patient does not suffer from a concomitant sleep disordered breathing disorder. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of monitoring an individual for the occurrence of a particular condition during the sleep state of the individual, comprising: applying an external probe to an external surface at a peripheral location on the individual&apos;s body for monitoring the peripheral vascular bed volume of the individual at the peripheral body location while applying a predetermined pressure field to the distal end of the peripheral body location, including its distal-most extremity, so as to prevent the occurrence of venous pooling within the peripheral body location, and thereby to produce an output from the probe corresponding to changes in the peripheral arterial bed volume at the peripheral body location; while the individual is in a sleep state, utilizing the probe to detect changes in the peripheral vascular bed volume of the individual at said peripheral body location and to produce an output corresponding thereto; and determining the sleep state condition of the individual according to the output of the external probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the external probe used is one of the several non-invasive finger-probes described in the above-cited PCT applications for monitoring the peripheral vascular bed volume of the individual, and for translating the measurements to changes in peripheral arterial tone. Particularly described were volume measuring probes and optical measuring probes applied to a finger (or toe) of the individual. Such probes were found to provide numerous advantages in monitoring the individual&apos;s vascular system for changes in the peripheral arterial bed volume, particularly in the following respects: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 1) by applying near diastolic pressure over the surface of the finger, which is transmitted to the arteries within the finger, they reduce the transmural pressure within those arteries, thereby freeing the arterial walls of tension and increasing their compliance allowing them to move more freely; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 2) by providing such pressure, they are able to prevent the pooling of venous blood in the measured part of the finger, thereby avoiding the occurrence of venous distention and possible reflex arterial constriction as a result of the venous distention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 3) by providing a contiguous buffer region proximal to the measurement site, they are able to reduce the effects of retrograde venous pressure perturbations and to extend the effective boundary of the pressure field in the measurement portion of the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The foregoing features of the finger probes described in the above-cited patent applications have been found to enhance their performance for the many described uses of the probe. While such probes remain the preferred ones due to these advantageous characteristics, it will be appreciated that the invention described below can also be implemented by using other peripheral vascular bed volume monitoring devices for detecting the specific markers to be described below. Examples of other types of devices for monitoring the changes in the peripheral vascular bed volume include; segmental plethysmographs, circumferential strain gage devices, optical plethysmographs, Doppler or laser Doppler sensors, isotope washout devices, thermal washout devices, electromagnetic devices, and any other devices which are affected by a change in the geometry of the finger (or other peripheral body part, e.g. toe or ear-lobe) in response to blood volume changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Examples of different sleep state conditions detected in accordance with the invention described below include: arousals during the sleep state, apneas, hypopneas, UARS events, a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern, periodic leg movements syndrome (PLMS) and rapid eye movement sleep state (REM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing information helpful in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition in a male patient, comprising: monitoring penile tumescence of the patient while sleeping to detect nocturnal penile erections; monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping to detect frequency of awakenings, episodes of apnea, and/or REM sleep stages; and utilizing information obtained by the monitoring operations to aid in determining whether the functional impotence condition in the patient is more likely due to an organic cause or to a psychogenic cause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of indirectly monitoring the functional blood glucose level condition of a diabetic patient, comprising: while the patient is sleeping, monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient; and utilizing the results of the sleep state monitoring operation for indicating the probable occurrence of abrupt changes in the glucose level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for monitoring an individual to detect the occurrence of a particular condition during the sleep state of the individual, comprising: an external probe to be applied to an external surface at a peripheral location on the individual&apos;s body for monitoring the peripheral vascular bed volume of the individual at the peripheral body location; the external probe including a pressure applicator for applying a predetermined pressure field to the peripheral body location including its distal-most extremity to reduce venous pooling and thereby to produce an output signal from the probe corresponding to changes in the peripheral arterial bed volume at the peripheral body location; and a processor for processing said output signal from the probe and for producing a signal indicating the particular sleep state condition when a predetermined change in the output of the probe is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for producing information helpful in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition in a male patient, comprising: a penile tumescence monitoring device for monitoring penile tumescence of the patient while sleeping to detect nocturnal penile erections, and for producing an output corresponding to the detected nocturnal penile erections; a sleep state monitoring device for monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping to detect frequency of awakenings, episodes of apnea, and/or REM (rapid eye movement) sleep stages, and for producing an output corresponding to the detected sleep state condition; and a processor for receiving and processing the outputs of the monitoring devices, and for producing an output indicative of detected nocturnal penile erections with respect to the detected sleep state condition to aid in determining whether the functional impotence condition in the patient is more likely due to an organic cause or to a psychogenic cause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for monitoring the glucose level condition of a diabetic patient, comprising: a sleep state monitoring device for monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping, and for producing an output corresponding thereto; and a processor for receiving and processing the output of said monitoring device, and for producing an output indicating the probable occurrence of abrupt changes in the measured nocturnal glucose level of the patient. </paragraph>

It includes a pressure applicator for applying a near diastolic pressure over the surface of the finger or toe to reduce the transmural pressure within the arteries in the finger or toe, thereby freeing the arterial walls of tension and preventing pooling of venous blood in the finger or toe. The pressure applicator also extends the pressure field to the distal end of the finger or toe and thus provides a contiguous buffer region proximate to the detector site. In the finger probe illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pressure applicator is supplied from an external fluid pressure system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> More particularly, finger probe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a rigid tubular casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the form of a thimble-shaped end cap, closed at one end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and open at the opposite end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for receiving a patient&apos;s finger. A deformable membrane <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of tubular configuration is located within end cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and is similarly closed at one end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and open at the opposite end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Membrane <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is of a diameter to define a socket for receiving the end of the person&apos;s finger, and to produce between the membrane and the inner surface of casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a closed tubular chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which expands and contracts depending on the pressure inside the chamber. Chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected via a port <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to a pressurized fluid source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a source of pressurized air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The pressure from source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is controlled by a valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is measured by a pressure transducer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> upstream of the valve. The differential pressure on the opposite sides of valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is measured by a differential pressure transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A high pass filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> filters the output of transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> before applying same to an analogue-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, together with the output of pressure transducer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The analogue-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> feeds its output to a processor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which produces outputs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to a monitor circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and also to an alarm circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Probe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> further includes a pressure cuff <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> constituted of a rigid cylinder <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a membrane <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> defining a chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which can be pressurized via an inlet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> communicating via a tube <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the pressurized source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Another valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided upstream of the differential pressure transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to enable measuring the differential pressure across valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Reservoirs <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> within broken lines to indicate that such reservoirs are optional, may be provided to decrease the sensitivity of volume changes in the respective chambers to small volume losses of gas due to leaks or to elasticity of the respective conduit system, and also to reduce the size of the back pressure changes due to the pulse waves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to perform a diagnostic procedure, valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are first opened, and the chambers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the finger-probe are evacuated to allow the patient to insert a finger into the probe. Then, the pressure is raised to a near diastolic pressure, sufficient to unload the arterial walls and to prevent venous pooling. The pressure applied by source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is measured by pressure transducer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> upstream of valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the pressure in the pneumatic compartments is automatically raised to 70 mm Hg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At this point, valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are closed, so that the pressure in the right chamber of pressure differential transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is kept constant. On the other hand, the pressure in the left chamber of transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> varies depending on the pressure inside chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the finger-probe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Changes in the volume of the subject&apos;s finger which are due to arterial blood pressure pulse waves produce an expansion or contraction of chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the gas pressure within chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Since valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is closed, the pressure changes affect only the left chamber of differential-pressure sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The differential pressure sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> detects these pressure changes and provides an output corresponding to the pressure changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A/D converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives the analog outputs of pressure transducers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and converts them into digital form before introducing them into CPU processor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> processes the measured finger volume changes to produce output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the volume measurements, and/or output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the volume change measurements with respect to time. Either one or both measurements can be displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as well as recorded in a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If the displayed output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shows a change in the measured volume, indicating peripheral vasoconstriction, this will be immediately seen by the observer viewing monitor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The peak to trough amplitude of the signal is generally proportional to the arterial pulsatile volume changes, and will decrease or attenuate upon peripheral vasoconstriction. Therefore, when the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is used for detecting peripheral vasoconstriction, the observer would be interested in relative changes of the amplitude of the trough to peak values, as opposed to the absolute values of the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The annular pressure cuff <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coaxial with and contiguous to the end cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on the proximal (heart) side of the device. The main purpose of the pressure cuff is to extend the boundary of the constant pressure field beyond the borders of the sensing probe, so as to avoid edge effects. Chamber <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the pressure cuff is also filled with a pressurized gas via conduit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>; however, solenoid valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> isolates conduit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from transducer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Cuff <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thus extends the static pressure field for a distance in the proximal (heart) direction from the site of measurement of the finger volume changes accompanying blood pressure waves. The annular pressure cuff <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> acts as a venous tourniquet which, together with the pressure field produced in end cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, prevents venous pooling in the distal end (particularly the most distal phalange) of the finger. It also substantially prevents uncontrolled venous back flow. Further, it partially unloads the wall tension of, but does not occlude, the arteries in the distal end of the finger when the finger is at heart level. While the pressure in the pressure cuff may differ from that in the sensing chambers <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it should not exceed it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Further details of the construction and operation of the finger probe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and particularly the manner in which it may be used to detect various sleep state conditions of the patient including frequency of awakenings, episodes of apnea, and REM sleep stages, are described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,205. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates another finger probe, also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,205, similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> except that changes in the optical density are sensed and measured, rather than changes in volume, to provide a measurement of the changes in the peripheral vascular system, and thereby an indication of the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thus, the finger probe illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, therein generally designated <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, also includes a rigid housing <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> closed at one end <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and open at the opposite end <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, receiving a tubular membrane <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> also closed at one end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and open at the opposite end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. End <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the membrane is in contact with the open end <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the casing to define a fluid chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> between the two. Chamber <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is connected via a port <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> formed in the casing end wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to a pressurized fluid source (not shown), as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Probe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> measures changes in the finger by an optical device including a light source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be located on one side of the finger, and a light receiver or detector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to be located on the opposite side of the finger, such that pulsatile blood volume changes in the finger are detected as changes in optical density by the light detector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. This information is fed via conductors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to an amplifier <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, where the information is amplified and filtered, before being fed to the A/D converter (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for processing by the processor (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the probe illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the measurement site, namely the location of the light source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and light detector <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, is considerably inwardly of the open end of the rigid casing <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the probe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which applies the static pressure field uniformly around the outer end of the finger. Therefore the annular pressure cuff (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) need not be included. However, if it is desired to locate the light source and light detector closer to the open end of the rigid casing of the probe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the annular pressure cuff (corresponding to pressure cuff <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), may also be used in the probe illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further details of such probe construction and various modifications thereof, as well as methods of using the probe for detecting sleep state conditions of a patient, and for diagnosing various other medical conditions, are described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,205 incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Monitoring Various Sleep State Conditions (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While the descriptions in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,205 focus mainly on measuring blood pressure and detecting myocardial ischemia, the method and apparatus of the present invention are directed primarily to monitoring various sleeping conditions of a subject, particularly the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, sleep arousals, sleep apnea, sleep hypopnea, upper airways resistance, periodic leg movement syndrome, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and congestive heart failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Sleep staging, in particular the determination of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage sleep, is a vital tool for diagnosing sleep disorders and numerous other conditions. During REM sleep, altered control of breathing occurs with greatly reduced chemosensitivity resulting in highly irregular breathing patterns and the greatest declines in blood oxygen saturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Changes in REM latency have been reported in a plethora of affective illnesses including endogenous depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders as well as in narcolepsy, alcoholism, Alzheimer&apos;s disease and impotence. REM latency is important not only in the diagnosis of these conditions but also in therapy and follow up since it is a sensitive indicator of the patient&apos;s condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A robust association was found between REM stage sleep and the attenuation of the finger-probe output signal. This attenuation was of a substantial magnitude compared to the prior non REM period. Three representative examples showing the time-course of the probe-output signal and sleep hypnograms were shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> of U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,205. It is important to note that the attenuation of the finger-probe output signal amplitude was not triggered by REM sleep, but appeared to be related to an ongoing cycle that was synchronized with the sleep stages cycle in such a way that the nadirs of this cycle coincided with REM sleep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Currently, REM stage sleep is identified by polysomnography, which requires costly apparatus, considerable patient instrumentation and specialized staff. One simplified REM detector is the &ldquo;night cap&rdquo; disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,219 to Hobson et al. which relies on two channels of information to detect REM sleep; body movements and eye movements. However, this method requires substantial instrumentation which may be uncomfortable for the patient and detrimental to sleep. Another patented device (U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,791 to Lavie) employs a heart rate variability method. However, this method requires demanding signal analysis, and may not be as reliable as the method utilizing the output signal of the finger-probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> REM detection utilizing the above-described probe could be an extremely useful adjunct to existing ambulatory monitoring systems, since it yields important information with a minimum of patient instrumentation in a highly cost effective manner. It could be used to provide intensive, long term, follow up in the patient&apos;s own home, which would be a logistic impossibility in the sleep lab setting. The probe could be readily used in combination with oxygen saturation monitoring and ambulatory apnea screening. It could eliminate the need for subjective operator evaluation of sleep studies and the dependency on the specialized and expensive instruments needed for laboratory based sleep staging, such as EEG, EOG and EMG measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a set-up which may be used for performing these tests. In this illustrated set-up, the finger-probe <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (e.g., of the construction described above in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) provides one input, via an analog-digital converter <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, to a processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes additional inputs from a pulse oximeter <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, which measures the oxygen saturation level of the blood; from an actigraph <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which serves as a sleep/wake detector; and from a nasal-oral airflow sensor <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, such as a thermistor, which measures the nasal-oral air flow of the sleeping patient; and from at least a single electrocardiograph electrode dipole for registering the patient&apos;s ECG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The foregoing inputs are processed by processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which produces outputs to a monitor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a signal and/or alarm unit <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, a storage device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a post-processor device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates another set-up including a conventional polysomnograph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which includes the output from the finger-probe <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as one of the inputs, together with the other inputs <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> commonly provided in such apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> During numerous highly controlled sleep studies in elite sleep laboratories, it was also found that there was a highly robust association between the appearance of alpha wave encephalographic activity signifying awakening during sleep, and attenuation of the finger-probe signal. This attenuation was of a substantial magnitude and was tightly linked to the appearance of the alpha wave activity, with a consistent time delay between the two phenomena. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A representative example showing the time-course of the finger-probe signal and the patient&apos;s EEG signal associated with such alpha wave activity is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrating a compressed record of a series of K-alpha events. These are typical microarousals, each comprised of a K complex with a tail of alpha EEG activity. These events are the hallmark of the upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) and may therefore be used for detecting UARS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that the maximum attenuation of the finger-probe signal amplitude always occurred after the appearance of the alpha wave. The finger-probe signal may therefore also be used for detecting UARS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The same strong temporal linkage is clearly seen in the spectrum of the EEG signal which can also be considered as a marker of the alpha activity. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> wherein the upper waveform is the finger-probe output signal envelope, and the lower waveform is the EEG spectrum of the sleeping individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In addition to the highly consistent linkage between alpha activity and finger-probe output over time, it was found the attenuation of the finger-probe output reached its nadir (trough) several milliseconds after the peak alpha activity Thus, alpha activity leads the nadir attenuation. This delay has been consistently found in a large number of patients and normals and therefore can also be used as an indication of UARS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An additional finding of diagnostic significance is that it is possible to distinguish between arousals related to the periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS) and arousals related to disordered breathing events during sleep on the basis of the time interval between probe signal attenuation events. For example, the average time interval between probe signal attenuation events in PLMS is 24.8 seconds while respiratory related attenuation events related to hypopneas had a mean interval of 34.1 seconds. Based on the interval between attenuations it is possible to distinguish between the non-respiratory and respiratory related events with a very high degree of sensitivity of about 85%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Brief arousal detection by the finger probe could be an extremely useful adjunct to existing ambulatory monitoring systems, since it yields important information with a minimum of patient instrumentation in a highly cost effective manner. Furthermore, adding the finger-probe signal to existing sleep laboratory recordings can aid in the rapid identification of brief arotisals. Such a probe could also be used to provide intensive, long term, follow up in the patient&apos;s own home, as well as a means for assessing treatment effectiveness, which would be a logistic impossibility in the sleep lab setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Adding the probe to provide an input to the polysomnograph apparatus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, enables the probe to be readily used in combination with respiratory indices currently used for apnea screening, such as oro-nasal airflow and pulse oximetry. Such apparatus would better enable a differential diagnosis to be made between arousals related to obstructive sleep disordered breathing, non-obstructive sleep disordered breathing disorders, or arousal from sleep such as those occurring in the periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS). Generally speaking, such a probe would enable UARS, and the other respiratory and non-respiratory conditions which are associated with arousal, to be identifiable both under the sleep laboratory environment, as well as under circumstances in which contemporary sleep apnea ambulatory screening methods would be unable to detect the condition. Also, the conventional arousals scoring which is EEG based, is insensitive to non-cortical arousals and suffers from large inter and intra scorers variability. The analysis of the suggested add on signal to the polysomnography, can be readily done automatically with no such variabilities and, as mentioned before, can add the detection of arousals having non-cortical indices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above described sleep related breathing disorders, there exists a different class of breathing disorders which are not obstructive in nature but which are in fact related to aberrant central nervous system control of breathing during sleep. The phase relationship between the probe output and the alpha waves, as well as the phase relationship between the probe output and the variations in oxygen saturation, can provide important information about the type of the apnea as well as the associated hemodynamic changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example a characteristic intermittent breathing pattern, known as &ldquo;Cheyne-Stokes breathing&rdquo;, occurs in patients suffering from advanced congestive heart failure. In this condition the patients breathing is remarkable in that it consists of alternating crescendo and decrescendo patterns of breathing. The existence of this breathing pattern can be detected by the described finger-probe since a remarkable concordance has been found to exist between the periodic breathing and periodic changes in the amplitude of the finger-probe signal. An example of this is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It was also found that when the probe output signal, and the oxygen saturation level of the blood, are considered in this condition, the nadirs of the probe output signal coincide with nadirs of blood oxygen saturation levels in some individuals, while it coincides with peak values in others. These differences may be related to cyclic activation of sympathetic nervous activity in response to the accumulating respiratory debt. The probe output signal begins to attenuate at the start of the respiratory crescendo phase in some cases, whereas in other cases, the probe output signal may only begin to increase in amplitude with the onset of the crescendo breathing phase, possibly related to improving cardiac function with the improvement of ventilation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The probe output signal has also been found to be a highly effective in detecting disordered breathing in sleep based on the circulatory responses to what is primarily a condition of disordered breathing. For example, it is known that apneas terminate in brief arousals, which are associated with tachycardia and elevated blood pressure suggestive of sympathetic activation (Morgan, Crabtree, Puleo. et al., 1996; Pitson and Stradling, 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thus, using the probe for monitoring the pulse wave in patients with full-blown sleep apnea syndrome revealed that terminations of the apneas are associated with marked attenuation of the pulse wave amplitude and usually with evidence of an increase in pulse rate. The attenuations coincided with the rebreathing phase, maintaining a constant phase relationship with the associated electroencepalographic waking activity. It was found that maximal vasoconstriction was delayed by approximately 7 seconds with respect to the first sign of arousal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In about 10% of the patients with severe sleep apnea syndrome, using the finger-probe for monitoring the pulse wave during sleep revealed a different picture. In addition to the arousal-related attenuation in the probe output, in these patients the probe output was also profoundly attenuated during the initial stages of the apnea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>showing that each apnea was associated with two attenuations rather than with one: the first was associated with the onset of the apnea, and the second with the arousal response at the end of the apnea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the large arrows indicate periods of the probe signal attenuation associated with the apneic periods. The smaller arrows indicate attenuations in the probe amplitude associated with brief arousal which are also associated with renewal of airflow and increased pulse rate. This can be clearly seen in the ECG tracing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>where the distance between the individual ECG signals is noticeably smaller. Similar changes of the pulse rate are seen in the probe signal as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the probe attenuation is observed to occur at the termination of apnea as well as during each of the three periods of apnea as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. During one such apnea, a clear reduction in the arterial blood pressure was observed (area marked in black). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It can clearly be seen that when the attenuation of the probe signal occurs during the brief arousal at the end of the apnea (grey areas), an increase in the pulse rate, and a large increase in blood pressure also occur. The attenuation of the probe signal at such times reflects increased vascular resistance, which is associated with the increased blood pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It is possible to consider the relationship of blood pressure, vascular resistance and cardiac output as being respectively analogous to voltage, resistance and current in Ohm&apos;s equation, such that cardiac output is proportional to the ratio between blood pressure and vascular resistance. Thus the increased blood pressure and increased vascular resistance as depicted in the attenuation of the probe signal, could occur in the absence of a change in cardiac output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this situation, a decrease in the probe signal without increased blood pressure could indicate a reduction in cardiac output. A reduction in the probe signal associated with a reduction in blood pressure (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), would be reflective of an even more substantial decrease in cardiac output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> It is unlikely that the changes in probe amplitude would be related to thermoregulatory affects, or other local regulatory effects, since their duration and repetitive nature are matched to the apnea cycles. It is possible to use the time interval between the appearance of ECG features, such as the QRS complex or the R wave, and features of the pulse-wave such as the peak or start of the upstroke, as an index of pulse transit time (PTT) which is known to be a surrogate of blood pressure. By comparing the PTT during episodes of probe signal attenuation to the intervening periods, it will be possible to differentiate between attenuation episodes associated with increased blood pressure and those not associated with increased blood pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) is a known method for characterizing beat-to-beat variability for ECG heart rate pulses (Peng C-K, Hausdorff J M, Goldberger A L. Fractal mechanisms in neural control: Human heartbeat and gait dynamics in health and disease. In: Walleczek J. ed. Nonlinear Dynamics, Self-Organization, and Biomedicine. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999). The DFA method is described elsewhere (C.-K. Peng, S. V. Buldyrev, S. Havlin, M. Simons, H. E. Stanley, and A. L. Goldberger, Phys. Rev. E 49, 1685 (1994). The alpha value provided by this method represents an index related to variability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It has been shown that by applying the DFA method to the signal outputted by the finger-probe described above, both the variability in the beat-to-beat pulse wave amplitude, and the pulse period, can be used for the detection of CHF (using the scaling alpha exponent alpha, which is the result of the DFA method), and that the diagnostic performance can be improved when using both DFA results applied to both amplitude and period of the time series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a scatter-graph showing alpha values of interbeat period (pulse rate PR) plotted against alpha values of amplitude for CHF patients (stars) and for normal subjects (circles). It can be seen that the separation of the CHF and normal populations is enhanced when both values are considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> 64 subjects (30 normals, 34 CHFs) participated in the study. The area under the curve values for receiver operating characteristics defining the sensitivity and specificity at a range working points of the method for detection of CHF patients are listed in Table 1 below.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It has been shown that by applying the DFA method to the signal outputted by the finger-probe, either the variability in the beat-to-beat pulse wave amplitude, or the pulse period, can be used for the detection of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) using the scaling exponent (alpha), which is the result of the DFA method.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> illustrate a finger probe, generally designated <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, of a construction described in International Patent Application PCT/IL02/00249, filed Mar. 26, 2002, or in the earlier International Patent Application PCT/IL99/00292, published Dec. 16, 1999 as WO 99/63884. In the interest of brevity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> of the present application show only the probe construction illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, respectively, of International Application PCT/IL02/00249, but in the interest of completeness, the entire contents of the two above-identified International Applications are incorporated herein by reference. Such a probe includes a self-contained fluid system for applying the near diastolic pressure over the surface of the finger (or toe) to reduce the transmural pressure and also to provide a contiguous buffer region proximal to the detector site. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the probe including removable liners for facilitating the application of the probe to the patient&apos;s finger (or toe), as will be described more particularly below; whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates the probe after it has been applied to the patient&apos;s finger (or toe) and the liners removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Briefly, probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> includes a housing containing an inner casing <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of thimble shape to define a compartment closed at one end and open at the opposite end for receiving a subject&apos;s finger. Probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> further includes a first, inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> defining, with the inner surface of casing <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, an inner chamber C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>for receiving a fluid to apply a static pressure to the subject&apos;s finger when received within the compartment, and a second membrane <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> defining a second chamber C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>communicating with the first chamber C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>via openings <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> through casing <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As distinguished from the probe constructions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> further includes an outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> defining a third chamber C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>with the second membrane <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. This third chamber C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is vented to the atmosphere via an opening <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> formed in the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The provision of the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, together with its vent opening <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, provides a number of important advantages as will be described more particularly below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> further includes a restraining member, generally designated <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, which is located within the compartment defined by casing <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> for receiving the subject&apos;s finger. As described in the above-identified U.S. Patents and International Patent Applications, restraining member <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> restrains the inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> from expelling the subject&apos;s finger from the compartment when chamber C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is pressurized. Restraining member <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be of any of the constructions described in the above-cited patents and applications, to include an annular ring <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> at the open end of the probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a bar <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> extending to the closed end of the compartment defined by the inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and inner casing <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> further includes an optical sensor <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> for sensing changes in the optical characteristics of the finger inserted within the compartment of the probe. In this case, the optical sensor <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> senses the density of the light passing through the skin of the subject&apos;s finger inserted within the compartment, and therefore includes a light source <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and a light detector <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> staggered up to 180&deg; with respect to each other. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> they are shown as located on the opposite sides of the compartment such that the detector <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> is displaced 180&deg; with respect to the light source <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and detector <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> are externally connected to a measuring system by electrical leads <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is further provided with two removable liners <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> lining the inner surface of the compartment receiving the subject&apos;s finger. Each liner is of a low-friction sheet material to facilitate the insertion of the subject&apos;s finger into the compartment. Such liners are particularly useful in probes having a self-contained fluid for producing the near diastolic pressure applied to the finger. They facilitate the insertion of the subject&apos;s finger by providing low-friction surfaces between the finger and the inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> under the static pressure. The low-friction property of the liners, together with the manner in which each is disposed between the subject&apos;s finger and the inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, also facilitates the slidable withdrawal of each liner from between the subject&apos;s finger and the inner membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The two liners <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> line the two inner surfaces of the housing compartment to face the opposite sides of the subject&apos;s finger when inserted therein. Each liner <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> includes an external portion, as shown at <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively, extending externally of the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, and an inner portion including two (or more) folded sections <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, respectively, received within the compartment between the inner membrane <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and the subject&apos;s finger when inserted into the compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the externally-extending portions <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the liners are temporarily adherent to the outer surface of the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. This may be done by the provision of spots of adhesive <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, between the respective liner and the outer casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates the condition of the probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> after both liners <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> have been withdrawn. Providing the internal portion of each liner with the folded sections <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, facilitates the slidable withdrawal of each liner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Including the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> in probe <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> produces a number of advantages. Thus, the outer casing <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> provides a rigid surface for adhering the removable liner strips <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, e.g., at the adhesion points <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. In addition, since the outer casing <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> encloses the outer membrane <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, it provides protection for that membrane, both during the use of the probe, and also during its handling and storage before use and between uses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Diagnosing a Functional Impotence Condition (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating one form of apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention for aiding in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition in a male patient. Briefly, the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, and therein generally designated <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, includes a penile tumescence monitoring device, generally designated <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, for monitoring penile tumescence of the patient while sleeping to detect nocturnal penile erections. The illustrated apparatus further includes various sleep state monitoring devices, such as described above, for monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping, particularly to detect frequency of awakenings, episodes of apnea, and/or REM sleep stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The sleep state monitoring devices illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13 a</cross-reference> finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, which detects changes in the peripheral vascular system, particularly the peripheral arterial tone, of the patient while sleeping; a pulse oximeter <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> for detecting changes in the blood oxygen saturation level of the patient while sleeping; an actigraph <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, which serves as a sleep/wake detector for detecting the sleep/wake state of the patient; an airflow detector <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, for detecting changes in the oral or nasal airflow of the patient while sleeping; and an ECG electrode dipole <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> for detecting changes in the ECG signals of the patient. One or more of such monitoring devices <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may be used in any desired combination. The outputs from monitoring devices <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> provide information regarding the sleep state condition of the patient, which information is helpful, with the information from the penile tumescence monitoring device <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition, i.e., whether the condition is more likely due to an organic cause or a psychogenic cause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The penile tumescence monitoring device <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be any suitable device for measuring penile tumescence and/or rigidity, such as one of those described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,188; 4,848,361 or 4,515,166. The penile rigidity monitoring device commercially available under the trade mark &ldquo;RIGISCAN&rdquo; has been found particularly useful for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> included in the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is preferably one of the external finger probes illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the drawings in the present application, and more particularly described in the prior applications and patents identified in the description of the respective probe. Such probes provide, in a convenient and non-invasive manner, information as to the sleep state of the patient which information is very helpful in evaluating the information from the penile tumescence or rigidity monitoring devices <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in diagnosing the cause of a functional impotence condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The pulse oximeter <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> monitors changes in the blood oxygen saturation level of the patient. This information is also useful, together with that supplied by the finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, in indicating the sleep state condition of the patient. Pulse oximeter <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, if used, may be incorporated in the finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, or may be used as a separate monitoring device. The actigraph <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> or other similar patient motion detector, serves as a sleep/wake detector for detecting the sleep/wake state of the patient. This device may be of a type commonly used in sleep medicine. The oral/nasal airflow detector <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> may be a thermistor or the like, as also known in polysomnographs, to measure the oral/nasal airflow of the sleeping patient. Such a detector, which is also optional in the illustrated apparatus, would provide further information supplementing that provided by the finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for indicating the sleep state condition of the patient. Similarly, the ECG electrode dipole detector <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, as also commonly included in polysomnographs, detects the ECG signal of the patient, which information is also useful in determining the sleep state of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the outputs from the penile tumescence or rigidity monitoring device <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, together with the outputs from the other monitoring devices <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> for monitoring the sleep state condition of the patient, are converted to digital form by an A/D converter <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, and are fed to a processor <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. Processor processes this information and produces outputs to a monitor <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, a signal and/or alarm <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, a storage device <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, and a post-processor device <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Thus, penile tumescence or rigidity monitoring device <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> monitors penile tumescence and/or rigidity of the patient while sleeping to detect nocturnal penile erections, and for producing an output corresponding to the detected nocturnal penile erections. At the same time, finger probe <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and the other sleep state monitoring devices <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> monitor the sleep state condition of the patient while sleeping to detect frequency of awakenings, episodes of apnea, and/or REM (rapid eye movement) sleep stages, and produce outputs corresponding to such detected sleep state condition. Processor <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> receives and processes the outputs of these monitoring devices and produces an output indicative of detected nocturnal penile erections time-correlated to the detected sleep state condition, to aid in determining whether the functional impotence condition in the patient is more likely due to an organic cause or to a psychogenic cause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> For example, a patient suffering from frequent awakenings or apnea episodes (cessation of breathing) during sleep, or a patient not able to sustain long periods of REM sleep, may not be experiencing sleep, particularly REM sleep, of sufficient duration for erection to occur. Thus, where nocturnal penile erections are not detected both during frequent awakenings, frequent apnea episodes, and/or short REM sleep, and also during infrequent awakenings, apnea episodes, and/or relatively long REM sleep, this would indicate an organic cause for the impotence condition. On the other hand, where nocturnal penile erections are not detected during frequent awakenings apnea episodes, and/or short REM sleep, but are detected during infrequent awakenings infrequent apnea episodes and/or long REM sleep, this would indicate a psychogenic cause for the impotence condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It is thus seen that such apparatus, providing sleep state information in addition to the penile tumescence and/or rigidity information, would be helpful in making the above diagnostic distinction between the possible causes of the impotence condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Diagnosing Hypoglycemia at Night </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus is more common at night, but the reason therefor is not fully understood. One potential explanation is that sleep inhibits the counter-regulatory hormonal response to hypoglycemia, and therefore children do not have &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; signals when glucose levels decline during sleep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor has been shown to measure glucose levels accurately, at frequent intervals without causing sleep disruption. However, it is an invasive measurement associated with a traumatic insertion procedure and a degree of patient risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The above-described finger probe, based on measuring peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) can be used to measure the time-course of digital pulsatile volume. Since the digital arteries are primarily innervated by the alpha adrenergic receptors, the PAT probe indirectly reflects the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This method thus enables the detection of autonomic responses, including arousals during sleep, on a continuous basis without the need to draw blood or interfere with the natural sleep of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A study entitled &ldquo;Paradoxical Effects of Hypoglycemia on Sleep Regulation in Children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus&rdquo; by G. Pillar, G. Schuscheim, R. Weiss, A. Malhotra, A. Shlitner, N. Peled, N. Shehadeh was conducted to investigate the relationship between glucose concentrations as well as the rate of change of glucose concentration, sleep and adrenergic and arousal response to spontaneous nocturnal hypoglycemia. An abstract of this study appears in Journal of Sleep Research, 2002, 11 (Suppl. 1), 1-260, 359 O. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> From the above, it can be seen that in only 1 of 15 patients without rapid blood glucose changes had PAT detected arousals, while in 7 out of 15 patients with rapid blood glucose changes there were PAT detected awakenings. Thus, the occurrence of awakenings in a child with type 1 diabetes carries a high positive predictive value of 87.5% since seven out of eight cases of awakening occurred in patients with rapid blood glucose changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Monitoring the sleep state condition of a subject, particularly the peripheral arterial tone (PAT) during sleep as described above, can also be used as an aid in diagnosing or treating other medical conditions or disorders. Described below are several such diagnostic applications and their diagnostic relevance particularly, but not exclusively when the subject is a child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Children </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Growth and development of children is dependent on sufficient sleep. Poor growth rate associated with adequate caloric intake (failure to thrive) is a frequent consequence of OSA in children. Children with OSA demonstrate significant decrease in energy expenditure during sleep following treatment for OSA. They increase weight and height following treatment (without a significant change in caloric intake). Development of children requires alertness while awake, and neuro-behavioral consequences of OSA in children are well established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the pediatric population, OSA is estimated to occur in 1-3% of children, but even higher prevalence was reported, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Snoring is estimated to occur in 10% of all children and needs to be evaluated for potential OSA. Normal values in children are considered to be a Respiratory Disorder Index (RDI) of less than 1 event per hour, and oxygen saturation which does not fall to less than 92%. Since the RDI&apos;s in children can be low despite a potentially severe disorder, alternative clinically based severity criteria were suggested. According to these criteria, grade 0 indicates normal children, grades 1-2 indicate simple snoring and increased upper airway resistance, respectively, grade 3 reflects apneas/hypopneas without oxygen desaturations, grade 4 with oxygen desaturations, and grade 5 with complications (e.g. cor pulmonale, cardiomegaly, heart failure). In children, the peak occurrence of OSA is between the ages 2-5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Symptoms in children are similar to those seen in adults, with the exception of restlessness that is a more common symptom in children, while sleepiness is somewhat less of a problem compared to adults. In children with OSA it is common that despite sleepiness they paradoxically demonstrate symptoms of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). In fact, in a survey of 27 children with ADHD, 25% had OSA, and could have their ADHD eliminated by treating their sleep disordered breathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Clinical consequences of OSA in children include poor school achievements, failure to thrive, secondary enuresis, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, cor pulmonale, or congestive heart failure. Since childhood OSAS is usually associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, the majority of cases are amenable to surgical treatment. Adenotonsillectomy is the most common therapy for OSA in children. However, there is a substantial subgroup of children with OSA without hypertrophy of tonsills or adenoids. Furthermore, in some children OSA persist after adenotonsillectomy. Also, even children in whom OSA resolved after adenotonsillectomy may demonstrate recurrence during adolescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Thus, children with potential OSA need to be diagnosed and followed up. PSG is even more cumbersome in children than it is in adults and is frequently not performed. Many surgeons prefer to perform adenotonsilectomy but skip the PSG. For this reason, many surgeries are performed unjustifiably (not withstanding medical justifications other than OSA). It should be mentioned that the natural history of adenoids and tonsils is to shrink over time, so the condition resolves spontaneously over time in most untreated children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> By standard measures it seems that children arouse less than adults following apneas. It is possible that children do not demonstrate EEG arousals, but do demonstrate autonomic arousals following respiratory events, and thus the PAT may be more sensitive in diagnosing them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Thus, children with potential OSA (about 10%) are a group in which the above-described technique for monitoring sleep state conditions can play a very important role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and Learning Disability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is a common psychobiological disorder of children, which can persist into adolescence and adulthood. ADHD classically consists of four characteristics: attention deficit, hyperactivity, distractibility and impulsivity. It usually affects approximately 4% of children, and usually 50% are diagnosed prior to the age of 5. Traditionally, ADHD was considered as a problem of over-alertness, nervousness, with the children affected being fidgety and over-stimulated. However, for a long time it has been well known that stimulating medications paradoxically result in improvement in the majority of the children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Parents perceive children with ADHD to have greater sleep difficulty than normally developing children. In some recent studies it has been shown that children with ADHD have reduced sleep quality compared with control children. In-lab whole night polysomnographic evaluation of sleep in children with ADHD revealed relatively high incidences of primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder of sleep. Likewise, it is well known that sleepy children due to sleep disturbances may demonstrate hyperactivity and attention deficit rather than excessive daytime somnolence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible that despite the overactivity and irritability children with ADHD demonstrate, in fact these children are sleepy. This can be a result of sleep disruption and non-restorative sleep, and may explain the effectiveness of stimulating medications. For this reason, it is now believed (although progressing slowly) that every child with abnormal behavior or learning disability should undergo a sleep evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Silent Nocturnal Asthma </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The prevalence of asthma in children is 5% or more. About 10-20% of affected children have increased nocturnal asthmatic activity (bronchoconstriction), which is not dramatic enough to take them to their doctor but may interfere with their sleep and result in growth retardation and learning disabilities. Thus, in asthmatic children the method of the present invention may be useful in recognizing nocturnal asthmatic activity and, consequently, for improving medical therapy. Similar considerations apply for adults with the exception of the detrimental developmental aspects related to children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Sleep Terrors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Sleep terrors are characterized by sudden arousals from sleep with piercing screams and intense fear manifested by heightened sympathetic activation (tachycardia, diaphoresis, flushing of the skin, mydriasis, and hyperpnea). The typical age for this condition is 4-12 years, peaking at age 5-7, with an approximate prevalence of 3-4% in this age group. This declines to less than 1% in adults. During such an event the child is unresponsive and confused as in other disorders of arousal. Once fully alert, the patient is generally amnestic to the sleep event, and does not have a recollection of a dream. This is one of the classical differences between sleep terrors and nightmares. The distinction between them is important for prognostic and further evaluation purposes. That is, in cases of recurrent nightmares a psychological evaluation may be indicated to rule out stress, trauma (abuse) or personality disorder, while in sleep terrors sometimes EEG is required to rule out temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Usually the distinction between sleep terrors and nightmares can be made by history alone, but in some cases a full polysomnographic study is required. In these cases the PAT may be useful since it can distinguish between the REM and non-REM sleep in addition to detecting the intense sympathetic storm in sleep terrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As indicated earlier, the finger probes described above which measure changes in the peripheral arterial bed volume, have been found to produce the best results in detecting the various sleep state conditions in accordance with the present invention. However, it will be appreciated that the detection of the various sleep state conditions described can also be effected by other means or by the use of other non-invasive probes which measure the peripheral vascular bed volume, and that many other variations, modifications and applications of the invention may be made. </paragraph>
