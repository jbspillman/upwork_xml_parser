<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a circuit configuration for applying a clocked application of a supply voltage to a load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such circuit configurations are used, by way of example, in switched-mode power supplies or power factor controllers, in which an inductor is respectively connected to a supply voltage in clocked fashion based upon actuation signals. In such a case, the actuation signals for the first switch, which is connected in series with the load, are produced by the control circuit, whose correct operation requires a supply voltage applied to its voltage supply terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A prior art circuit configuration of such a type is disclosed in European Patent Application 0 585 788 A1, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,285,369 to Balakrishnan, particularly, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> thereof. In such a case, the circuit configuration is part of a switched-mode power supply, where a series circuit including the primary coil of a transformer and a first switch, in the form of a MOSFET, is connected between output terminals of a bridge rectifier. To actuate the MOSFET, a control circuit is provided. To supply the control circuit with voltage, a depletion-mode MOSFET or a JFET (Junction FET) is connected between the primary coil and the MOSFET, with one supply terminal of the control circuit being connected to a node that is common to the JFET and to the MOSFET in order to output a supply voltage for the control circuit when the MOSFET is off. Furthermore, in addition to the secondary winding of the transformer, the secondary side is provided with an auxiliary winding having a downstream rectifier, the auxiliary winding likewise being used to supply voltage to the control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the MOSFET acting as a switch in this apparatus is on, the JFET connected in series with it is also on. When the MOSFET turns off, the JFET also starts to turn off, which results in approximately all of the supply voltage appearing across the JFET. In a transition phase, a current then still flows through the JFET into the control circuit, but this is associated with a high power loss on the JFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A secondary-side auxiliary winding having a rectifier, use of which for supplying voltage to a control circuit even without the JFET from the cited print is already in the prior art, requires the use of discrete components whose cost has an adverse effect on the total price of the power supply unit or power factor controller. This is particularly true for switched-mode power supplies in power classes between 5 W and 20 W, which are used to safeguard the &ldquo;standby mode&rdquo; in electronic appliances and that are subject to an especial cost pressure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a circuit configuration for applying a supply voltage to a load that overcomes the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that dispenses with an auxiliary winding and with the use of discrete components for the voltage supply to the control circuit and in which there is no or only very little power loss when providing the supply voltage for the control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a circuit configuration for clocked application of a supply voltage to a load, the circuit configuration including a first switch having a first control connection, the first switch connected in series with the load, a control circuit connected to the first switch, the control circuit having a first output terminal connected to the first control connection for actuating the first switch and first and second voltage supply terminals, and a second switch having a second control connection to which an actuation signal is supplied, the second switch connected between the load and the first voltage supply terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in addition to the first switch connected in series with the load, the circuit configuration has a second switch that is connected between the load and the first voltage supply terminal of the control circuit. In such a case, when the first switch has turned off, the second switch, which is on and is preferably likewise actuated by the control circuit, takes on the current flowing through the load and supplies it to the control circuit through the first voltage supply terminal thereof. The current flowing through the second switch is preferably buffered in a capacitor connected in parallel with the voltage supply terminals of the control circuit to provide a continuous, only slowly decreasing supply voltage for the control circuit after the second switch has turned off until it next turns on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the on state, the voltage drop across the second switch is only small in relation to the total voltage on account of the low conduction resistance, which means that the power loss on the second switch is low. A large part of the voltage drops across the load, with inductive loads involving storage of energy that is subsequently used in a switched-mode power supply or power factor controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The second switch can be implemented, almost without additional cost requirement, as an integrated component in the integrated circuit for the control circuit or in the integrated circuit for the first switch&mdash;with the control circuit and the first switch also being able to be accommodated in an integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the control circuit has a second output terminal connected to the second control connection for actuating the second switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, there is provided a capacitor is connected between the first and second voltage supply terminals and in parallel with the control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, there is provided a series circuit including the second switch and the control circuit is connected in parallel with the first switch. So long as the first switch in such an embodiment is on, the voltage appearing across the series circuit including the second switch and the control circuit is not sufficient to cause a flow of current, when the second switch is on, into the control circuit and to the capacitor connected in parallel with the control circuit. When the first switch is turned off, the voltage appearing across its load path rises until a voltage has been reached that allows a current to flow to the capacitor through the second switch, which is on. The second switch is preferably likewise actuated using the control circuit, with a second output terminal of the control circuit being connected to a control connection of the second switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The second switch can be actuated in various ways. Thus, the second switch can already be on when the first switch is on. Alternatively, the second switch can be turned on only shortly before or at the same time as the first switch turns off in order to supply current to the control circuit for a period of time. The period for which the second switch remains on after the first switch has turned off is dependent, in the control circuit, on the voltage present across the voltage supply terminals or across the capacitor. Preferably, the second switch remains on until the capacitor has been &ldquo;filled&rdquo; again with the charge drawn since the last charging operation or until the voltage across the capacitor reaches a prescribable nominal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, there is provided a diode connected between the first voltage supply terminal and the second switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another feature of the invention, the first switch and the second switch have a common node and a diode is connected between the common node and the first voltage supply terminal of the control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet a further feature of the invention, there is provided a diode connected between the first voltage supply terminal and the second control connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an added feature of the invention, the second switch is connected in series with the first switch and preferably between the load and the first switch. In such an embodiment, the first voltage supply terminal of the control circuit is connected to the node that is common to the first and to the second switch, preferably, through a diode. When the first and second switches are on, a current flows through the load and through the two switches connected in series therewith. Virtually all of the supply voltage present across the series circuit drops across the load. The voltage dropping across the first switch is not sufficient to cause a flow of current in the control circuit connected in parallel therewith and to the capacitor connected in parallel with the control circuit. If the first switch is turned on and the second switch remains on, the voltage appearing across the first switch rises until, with the second switch on, a current can flow through the load and the second switch to the capacitor to charge it again. The second switch is proportioned such that it has a low conduction resistance in the on state, which means that the power loss across it is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an additional feature of the invention, the supply voltage is supplied at a terminal and a resistor is connected between the terminal and the first voltage supply terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again another feature of the invention, there is provided a resistor connected in parallel with the second switch between the load and the first voltage supply terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again a further feature of the invention, the first switch has a connection terminal remote from the load and the second voltage supply terminal and the connection terminal are connected to a common terminal at reference ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first and second switches are preferably in the form of semiconductor switches, particularly in the form of MOSFETs, with the second semiconductor switch being able to be in the form of a depletion-mode FET or JFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again an added feature of the invention, the first and second switches are semiconductor switches selected from the group consisting of FETs and IGBTs. The second switch can be a depletion-mode MOSFET or a JFET. The first switch can be an IGBT and the second switch can be a MOSFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention also covers a method for actuating the first and second switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a switched-mode power supply for applying a supply voltage to a load, the power supply including a first switch having a first control connection, the first switch connected in series with the load, a control circuit connected to the first switch, the control circuit having a first output terminal connected to the first control connection for actuating the first switch and first and second voltage supply terminals, a second switch having a second control connection to which an actuation signal is supplied, the second switch connected between the load and the first voltage supply terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a method for applying a supply voltage to a load, including the steps of connecting a first switch in series with the load, the first switch having a first control connection, connecting a control circuit to the first switch, the control circuit having a first output terminal and first and second voltage supply terminals, connecting the first output terminal to the first control connection for actuating the first switch, connecting a second switch between the load and the first voltage supply terminal, the second switch having a second control connection, supplying an actuation signal to the second control connection, actuating the first and second switches by turning on the first and second switches at least approximately at the same time and turning off the first and second switches at different times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with again an additional mode of the invention, an on duration of the second switch is dependent upon a value of the supply voltage present across the first and second voltage supply terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a method for applying a supply voltage to a load, including the steps of connecting a first switch in series with the load, the first switch having a first control connection, connecting a control circuit to the first switch, the control circuit having a first output terminal and first and second voltage supply terminals, connecting the first output terminal to the first control connection for actuating the first switch, connecting a second switch between the load and the first voltage supply terminal, the second switch having a second control connection, supplying an actuation signal to the second control connection, actuating the first and second switches by turning on the second switch one of before and at approximately the same time as the first switch is turned off and turning off the second switch after the first switch has been turned off. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the figures of the drawings, unless stated otherwise, identical reference symbols denote identical parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a first exemplary embodiment of a circuit configuration in accordance with the invention for the clocked application of a first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a load TR. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the inventive circuit configuration being used in a switched-mode power supply in which the first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is available between the first and second supply terminals K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with the first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being produced from a power supply voltage U<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>by rectification using a bridge rectifier GLR and a capacitor C<highlight><subscript>G</subscript></highlight>. In the case of the switched-mode power supply, the load to be connected to the supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> forms a primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>of a transformer TR to which it is possible to connect, on the secondary side, a load for supplying a DC voltage on connection terminals AK<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is on, approximately all of the first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is present across the load L<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>. In such a case, the current rises&mdash;after an initial current pulse&mdash;constantly, as shown by the time profile for the current I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the first switch after turning on at the time t&equals;t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The voltage appearing across the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in such a case is too low to cause a flow of current through the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST</subscript></highlight>. Normally, the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> present across the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>on account of the stored charge is already higher than the voltage present across the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is on. A diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>and the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prevents the charge stored in the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>from flowing away through the switches when the first and second switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned off at the time t&equals;t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and if the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is on at the same time, then the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> takes on the current flowing through the primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and, thus, charges the capacitor until it is turned off under the actuation of the control circuit ST at a time t&equals;t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows, in dashes, the profile for the current through the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has turned off. It can be seen that the current through the primary coil continues to rise steadily until the second switch turns on. The area content of the shaded area corresponding to the charge is taken up by the capacitor. To be precise, the current through the primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>when charging the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>rises somewhat less sharply than previously because charging the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>entails a slight voltage loss on the primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>. Normally, the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is no higher than 10-15 V as compared with a first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of higher than 200 V, which means that the voltage loss is barely significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the on state, the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably has a low conduction resistance, which means that virtually no power loss occurs on the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when charging the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>is being charged with the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> off and the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on, energy continues to be stored in the primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and, when the first and second switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are off, is delivered to a load that can be connected on the secondary side. The inventive circuit configuration, thus, causes voltage to be supplied to the control circuit ST, which is simple to implement and operates with very low losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Actuation of the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> works in the conventional manner for switched-mode power supplies based on the prior art. The second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be actuated in a variety of ways. A governing factor in such a context is that the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is on when the first switch S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned off. The period for which the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is on preferably depends on the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> present across the control circuit ST, which decreases slowly on account of the delivery of current to the control circuit ST between the periods of time in which charge subsequently flows through the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably remains on until the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches a prescribable nominal value or until a charge has flowed to the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>that corresponds to the charge that has flowed away through the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> since the last flow of charge, in order subsequently to be turned off under the actuation of the control circuit ST. A circuit configuration for producing an actuation signal AS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the second switch is implemented in the control circuit ST based upon whether the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> exceeds or falls short of a nominal value. Configurations that satisfy such functionality are likewise in the prior art and are not explained in more detail here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a circuit configuration that is described fundamentally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in which the first and second switches S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in the form of transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, particularly, in the form of MOSFETS. In such a case, the gate connection G of the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the first output terminal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the control circuit ST, and the gate connection G of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the second output terminal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the control circuit ST. In such an embodiment, a startup resistor R<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>is preferably connected between the load L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>to charge the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>to begin with. In such a case, the resistor R<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>is chosen to be of a size such that, with the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>is discharged only slightly through the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prevents the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>from being discharged through the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On account of the technology, most MOSFETs have an integrated freewheeling diode that causes the MOSFET. to be off only in the drain-source direction D-S when no control voltage is applied, while the MOSFET is on when a forward voltage is applied between the source and drain electrodes. The external second diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prevents a flow of current in this direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If the second transistor is in the form of an enhancement-mode transistor, then, when using an n-channel transistor, the gate electrode G requires a potential that is higher than the potential on the source electrode S, and, hence, on the first voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The control circuit ST preferably has a charge pump circuit or a &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; circuit, as are in the prior art, to produce from the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a higher voltage for actuating the second switch S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment, the second transistor is in the form of a depletion-mode FET or in the form of a JFET. Such transistors are on even when there are low negative voltages between the gate and source electrodes G, S, and do not turn off until the negative voltage exceeds a magnitude that is dependent on the construction. In such a case, the way in which the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is preferably actuated is that its gate electrode G is connected in the control circuit ST to the first voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and, hence, to the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, through the second output terminal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to turn on the transistor. To turn it off, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to the second terminal K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and, hence, to reference ground potential, through the second voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the inventive circuit configuration, which allows the use of enhancement mode transistors as first and second transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In such a case, a further, forward-biased diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected between the first voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or one terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST</subscript></highlight>, and the gate electrode G of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is on under the actuation of the control circuit ST, the drain electrodes D of the first and second transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are at a low potential that corresponds approximately to the reference ground potential on the second terminal K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On account of its freewheeling diode DF, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for the purposes of illustration, the source electrode S of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at a potential that is above the potential on the drain electrode D, or the reference ground potential, by the forward voltage for the diode DF, i.e., approximately 0.6 V. Through the diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the gate electrode G of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at a potential that corresponds to the value of the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> less the value of the forward voltage for the first diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This potential is, for an assumed second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of approximately 10-15 V, much higher than the potential on the source electrode S, which means that the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is always on when the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is on. So long as the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is on, there is no flow of current through the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in this case. When the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> turns off, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> remains on because the charge stored in its gate capacitor cannot flow away through the diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> then draws the primary current from the primary coil L<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>to charge the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST</subscript></highlight>. To turn it off, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is discharged through the second output terminal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the control circuit ST, preferably, to reference ground potential on the terminal V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. To such an end, the control circuit preferably contains a current sink that can be connected between the second output terminal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the second voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or the terminal K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the circuit configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In such a case, the first switch T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in the form of an IGBT that, as compared with the use of a MOSFET, has the advantage of a lower resistance in the on state, but has the drawback of a longer reaction time when turning off, i.e., the current in the IGBT decays slowly upon turning off. The present invention allows such a current to be able to decay slowly while the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> takes on the primary current. The circuit can, therefore, also be used for high switching frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of an inventive circuit configuration used in a power factor controller, where it is used for the clocked application of an inductor L to a first supply voltage U<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is present between a first and a second supply terminal K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is produced from a power supply voltage UN by a bridge rectifier GLR. With the supply voltage U<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> applied, the inductor draws energy that it then forwards to output terminals AK<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, AK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through a rectifier configuration D, C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as first switch, is connected in series with the inductor L, and its gate electrode G is connected to the first output terminal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the control circuit ST. The second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as second switch, is connected between the inductor L and the first voltage supply terminal of the control circuit ST, with the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being connected in series with the inductor L and the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, between the inductor L and the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In such a case, the first voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected through a diode D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a node that is common to the first and to the second transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The gate connection of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the second output terminal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the control circuit ST and through a diode D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the first voltage supply terminal V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or one terminal of the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST</subscript></highlight>. When the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is on, the source electrode S of the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is approximately at the reference ground potential of the second terminal, and its gate electrode is above the value of the reference ground potential approximately by the value of the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is, thus, likewise on. The inductor L has then been connected to the supply voltage U<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and draws energy. When the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> turns off, the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> remains on because its gate capacitor cannot be discharged through the diode D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The current flowing through the inductor then flows through the second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the diode D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>to provide the second supply voltage U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A common feature of all the embodiments is that, when the first transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has turned off, the capacitor C<highlight><subscript>ST </subscript></highlight>is charged through the second switch by the current flowing through the load L<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>, L. The energy stored in the capacitor is used to supply the control circuit ST until charge is drawn through the second switch again. The second transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> remains on until a charge has flowed to the capacitor that corresponds to the charge that has flowed away since charge was last drawn. </paragraph>
