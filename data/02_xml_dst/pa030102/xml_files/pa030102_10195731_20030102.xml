<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In order to simulate the input or output load of an analog circuit, the output of the analog circuit is connected to the input of a driver stage. A measuring element is placed between the input of the driver stage and the reference potential, in order to record the output voltage of the analog circuit. A digital simulator controls a controllable transfer impedance, arranged between the output of the driver stage and the reference potential, in order to simulate various output loads. An alternative is to connect the output of the driver stage to the input of the analog circuit. The input of the driver stage has a shunt connection of a controllable current or voltage source, a first resistance and a first capacitance. The digital simulator controls the controllable current or voltage source, in order to simulate various output loads. The driver stage is switched off when appropriate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a circuit configuration for simulating the output load of an analog circuit A. The output of the analog circuit A is connected to the input of a driver stage I. The output of the driver stage I is connected to ground via a controllable coupling resistor RI. The control input of the controllable coupling resistor RI is connected to the control output of a digital simulator DS. A measuring element V for detecting the output voltage of the analog circuit A is situated between the input of the driver stage I and ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The digital simulator DS simulates different output loads for the analog circuit A by varying the coupling resistance RI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An inventive circuit configuration for simulating the input load of an analog circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A parallel circuit composed of a controllable current source Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of a driver stage I. The control output of a digital simulator DS is connected to the control input of the controllable current source Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The output of the driver stage I is connected to the input of the analog circuit A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The digital simulator DS controls the controllable current source Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to realistically simulate different input loads for the analog circuit A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of a configuration for simulating the input or output load of an analog circuit is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has the same design as the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but is supplemented by a parallel circuit composed of a second controllable current source Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a second resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a second capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the ENABLE input of the driver stage I. The control input of the current source Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a second control output of the digital simulator DS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the input of an analog circuit A is connected to the output of the driver stage I, the digital simulator DS simulates different input loads for the analog circuit A by switching on the current source Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and controlling the current source Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If, by contrast, the output of the analog circuit A is connected to the output of the driver stage I, the driver stage I is switched off by the digital simulator DS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A further exemplary embodiment of a configuration for simulating the input or output load of an analog circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has the same design as the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A measuring element V is situated between the output of the driver stage I and ground in order to detect the output voltage of the analog circuit A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous to provide a CMOS inverter stage or what is termed as a default driver for the driver stage I. Coupling to the analog circuit is preferably performed via an RC element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention is distinguished by the advantage that it sufficiently realistically simulates the input or output load of an analog circuit with critical input signals such that additional simulations are no longer required. </paragraph>
