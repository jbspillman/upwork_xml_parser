<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of laundry washing machines. More specifically, the invention comprises a method and apparatus for measuring load imbalance in the spinning drum of a washing machine, and then using the value of the load imbalance to calculate the maximum safe spinning speed during the water extraction cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Laundry washing machines typically use a rotating drum to agitate the clothes being washed. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which contains cutaways to aid visibility, washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which rotates around horizontal axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is contained within drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been taken through the washing and rinsing cycles, it is necessary to remove excess water before the clothes can be removed and placed in a dryer. This goal is typically accomplished by rotating drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a relatively high speed, so that centrifugal acceleration forces clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> against the interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the rotation of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is continued, the water within clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> flows out through perforations in interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is removed via channeling means within drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While many methods are employed to ensure even distribution of clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, load imbalance is a frequent problem. If clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not evenly distributed, the resulting imbalance will cause a vibration while drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is spinning. If the imbalance is significant, this vibration can cause the rotating drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to strike chassis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, resulting in damage to the machine. Thus, the detection of an imbalanced load is important for safe operation of washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Several methods have been previously used to detect an unbalanced condition. First, mechanical limit switches (&ldquo;trembler&rdquo; switches) can be mounted on chassis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to detect an unbalanced load. If sufficient vibration builds, the &ldquo;trembler&rdquo; switch will make contact and the resulting circuit is used to trigger a shut-down of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The same result can be accomplished with an electrical accelerometer switch. This type of device measures oscillating acceleration (vibration) by measuring the mechanical force induced in a load cell. Like the trembler switch, it sends a shut-down signal if a fixed vibration threshold is exceeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another method of detecting load imbalance is to monitor the variation in drive motor load when drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotated at low speed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a simplified rear view of washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Drum pulley <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is attached to the rear of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is mounted to chassis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in the area below drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has motor pulley <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which drives drive belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Drive belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in turn, drives drum pulley <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which drives drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An imbalanced load in drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will therefore cause a variation in the load experienced by drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In order to understand this phenomenon, the reader&apos;s attention is directed to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a front view of washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, again in simplified form. The imbalanced load is represented by a single unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is spinning in the direction indicated by the arrow. When unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in the position depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the gravitational force on unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (Fw), opposes the driving torque of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the load. When unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in the position depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the gravitational force acts in the same direction as the driving torque, thereby decreasing motor load. The result is a sinusoidal variation in motor load, resulting from the raising and lowering of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within the earth&apos;s gravitational field. The reader will appreciate that this phenomenon is only observed in washing machines having an off-vertical spin axis. For a machine having a purely vertical spin axis, there will be no load variation caused by gravity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The magnitude of the load variation within drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is proportional to the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the load variation can be accurately sensed, the magnitude of the imbalance can be determined. The variation in motor load will cause a small variation in motor speed. If drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is equipped with an accurate tachometer, it is possible to measure this variation in speed, and it is therefore possible to calculate the magnitude of the imbalanced load. This magnitude is then used to determine whether the load is sufficiently well balanced to initiate the spin cycle. This method is typically employed at a relatively low spin speed in order to detect any imbalance before the vibration has built to a dangerous level. If the load is sufficiently well balanced, drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would then be accelerated to the speed normally used during the spin cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> All of these methods, consisting of the trembler switch approach, the accelerometer approach, and the motor load sensing approach, traditionally result in a &ldquo;GO/NO-GO&rdquo; decision on the spin cycle. If clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sufficiently balanced, the machine will proceed to the spin cycle. If clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not sufficiently balanced, several things may occur. Many machines are programmed to stop and then begin a series of motions intended to redistribute the load. Other machines will simply shut down and await operator intervention. Even for those machines with provisions for an attempted redistribution, the redistribution will only be attempted a few times before the machine shuts down. The result is that a significantly imbalanced load will cause the machine to shut down before the spin cycle, meaning that clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be left soaking wet. The operator often discovers the machine in a seemingly inoperative condition and, unaware that it needs to be reset, places a needless service call. Additionally, the three approaches described require the use of an extra sensor or sensors, thereby adding cost and reliability concerns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A more sophisticated solution is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,393 to Payne et.al. (1994). The Payne device seeks to calculate the load imbalance, and then use this value to select among several available terminal spin speeds in order to ensure that a maximum permissible vibration is not exceeded. It calculates the load imbalance in a two-step process. First, the device applies a fixed torque to the spinning drum at relatively low speed (approximately 30 to 50 rpm) and measures the time interval required to accelerate the drum to 250 rpm. This time measurement is used to calculate the moment of inertia of the load within the drum, and thereby obtain an approximate value for its mass. The reader should note that, over this relatively low speed range, the time interval is not significantly sensitive to load imbalance; i.e., an imbalanced load will accelerate at nearly the same rate as a balanced one. Thus, the first time interval is measured to determine mass, irrespective of imbalance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As the drum is accelerated past 250 rpm, a significant load imbalance will retard the acceleration of the drum. This phenomenon is illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> in the Payne et.al. disclosure. An unbalanced load will take longer to accelerate from 250 to 600 rpm, as shown by the diverging angular velocity curves. This information, when used in conjunction with the total load information obtained during the acceleration from low speed to 250 rpm, is used to determine the imbalance. The magnitude of the imbalance is then used to determine what maximum spin speed will be selected from among several discrete available speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The Payne et.al. invention does require reasonably accurate measurement of drum speed and elapsed time. These requirements do not necessarily necessitate additional sensors, however. The reader will note from the Payne et.al. disclosure that the spinning drum is directly coupled to an electric drive motor. The motor controller would typically have time and motor speed sensing means. Thus, by monitoring existing functions of the motor controller, it is possible to determine drum speed and elapsed time without the need for additional sensors. The reader will therefore appreciate that the methodology disclosed in Payne et.al. can be implemented without additional sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The Payne et.al. method is not without its limitations, however. It is not capable of measuring the load imbalance with sufficient accuracy to determine precisely what the terminal spin velocity should be. Rather, it is only capable of measuring the imbalance with enough accuracy to determine whether the load will accelerate smoothly through one of several natural frequencies inherent to the machine. The possible terminal spin speeds are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> of the disclosure. This accuracy limitation was acceptable in its field of application&mdash;primarily residential washing machines. However, a method of more accurately determining load imbalance so that a continuously variable terminal spin speed could be calculated, is certainly preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The known methods for dealing with load imbalance in a laundry washing machine are therefore limited in that they: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 1. Require additional sensors, thereby adding cost to the machine; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> 2. Provide only a &ldquo;GO/NO-GO&rdquo; decision on the spin cycle; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> 3. Result in a machine shut-down, with consequent needless service calls; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 4. Do not provide enough accuracy in the measurement of the load imbalance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to optimize the maximum angular velocity employed for drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the water extraction, or &ldquo;spin&rdquo; cycle. The principal unknown is the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, within clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An additional unknown of some significance is the moment of inertia of clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when it is saturated. The moment of inertia will be impossible to accurately determine, since there is no means provided to sense the total mass of clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus, the method disclosed seeks to determine the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without having to know the total mass of clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The magnitude of unbalanced load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is calculated from the variations in the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while it is spun at a relatively low angular velocity. Once the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is known, it is possible to calculate the maximum angular velocity to be employed in the water extraction cycle for that load. The value for the maximum angular velocity is stored in memory, and drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is then accelerated to that angular velocity for the water extraction cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Since an additional sensor would be needed to directly measure angular velocity, the method disclosed seeks to indirectly determine angular velocity by measuring other values which can be determined without additional sensors. The other values which may be used to determine angular velocity are: motor torque, motor current, motor power phase angle, and motor slip. The techniques used to measure these values and thereby determine the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be explained in separate sections. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The primary goal of the present invention is to maximize the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the water extraction cycle, while keeping vibration transmitted to chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within an acceptable range. The vibration force induced when drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is spun with unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contained therein, is represented by the expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*r*&ohgr;</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> where F<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>refers to the magnitude of the vibration force, M<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>refers to the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, r refers to the radius of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and &ohgr; refers to the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. F<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>is established for the design of the entire machine, and it is based on the maximum vibration load the machine is intended to routinely handle. A typical value for F<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>would be 250 Newtons. The expression shown above may then be rewritten to solve for angular velocity as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;{square root}{square root over (<highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*r</italic></highlight>))}&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, so long as F<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>has been established, &ohgr; may be calculated for each value of M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. The value of &ohgr; then corresponds to the maximum angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which will not exceed F<highlight><subscript>v </subscript></highlight>for a given M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. A method for determining the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is therefore of critical importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The first step in determining M<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is to develop an expression for the angular acceleration experienced by drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when it is spinning with unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the reader will observe that unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> exerts a torque on drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as a result of its weight (Fw). The equation describing this torque resulting from unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*cos (&thgr;)</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> where &ldquo;g&rdquo; is the acceleration due to gravity, &ldquo;r&rdquo; is the radius of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;&thgr;&rdquo; is the angular displacement in a counterclockwise direction, starting from the axis shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also experiences torque as a result of friction in its bearing supports, which is linearly proportional to the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This torque may be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&minus;kf*&ohgr;</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 4) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> where &ldquo;kf&rdquo; is the coefficient of friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Finally, drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> experiences torque delivered by drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which will be represented by the variable T<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the summation of the torques acting on drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>or </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;kf*&ohgr;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*cos (&thgr;)</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The angular acceleration of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is equal to &Sgr;T divided by the total rotational moment of inertia of the rotating system. This equation may be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&agr;&equals;1/<highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*&Sgr;T</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 7) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> where &agr; is the angular acceleration of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and I<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>is the total rotational moment of inertia of the system. Substituting in the expression for &Sgr;T gives the following expression for angular acceleration of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&agr;&equals;1<highlight><italic>/I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>*(<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;kf*&ohgr;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*</italic></highlight>cos(&thgr;))&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 8) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> This expression is in the form of a differential equation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an exemplary curve for angular acceleration <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> versus time. The curve shown is for the time period after drum <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has accelerated to reach a steady angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (apart from the sinusoidal variation caused by unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is easier to perceive the wave shape of angular acceleration <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is spinning at a relatively low angular velocity. However, it is also necessary to spin drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> fast enough for centrifugal force to pin clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> firmly against interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing constant redistribution of clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Practical experience has shown that the centrifugal acceleration needed to accomplish this task is approximately 2 G&apos;s. Drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a radius of 0.394 m. This fact means that the angular velocity needed to produce a centrifugal acceleration of 2 G&apos;s on clothing load <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is 7.059 Radians/s (67.4 RPM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thus, the first step in the process of determining a value for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is to have drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> apply torque to drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until it reaches a steady average angular velocity of around 67 RPM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the resulting curves for angular acceleration <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and unbalanced torque load <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in this state of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As was stated previously in this disclosure, one goal of the present invention is to measure the value of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without requiring the use of additional sensors. There is, in fact, enough information contained in the curves shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to determine a good approximation for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> could actually be determined using any one of the three curves, though different sensing techniques are required. Each possibility will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Detailed Description&mdash;Motor Terminal Current Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Unbalanced torque load <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may, as has been previously explained, be represented by the following expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T&equals;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;kf*&ohgr;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*</italic></highlight>cos(&thgr;)&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At the point where an average angular velocity has reached a steady state, T<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>will be very nearly equal to the frictional torque (kf*&ohgr;). Because unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is varying sinusoidally, the two terms will not be exactly equal at all points in time. But, since the variation is small in relation to the overall magnitude, we may assume that the two terms are equal without introducing significant error. Therefore, setting T<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>equal to kf*&ohgr; gives the following simplified expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T&equals;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*</italic></highlight>cos(&thgr;)&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 9) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> &Sgr;T is therefore a function of angular displacement (&thgr;). The approximate maximum value for &Sgr;T may be found by setting cos(&thgr;)&equals;&minus;1. The following expression results: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 10) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> where (&Sgr;T)<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>represents a maximum value. If (&Sgr;T)<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>can be measured, M<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>can then be determined using the same equation, manipulated algebraically: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;(&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>g*r</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 11) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> graphically illustrates the variation in torque caused by unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Unbalanced torque load <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is seen to vary sinusoidally from balanced torque load <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In order to calculate M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, an accurate measurement must be made of the torque applied to drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This measurement could be accomplished using a piezoelectric load cell, measuring strain on the shaft driving drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It could also be made by a spring-biased angular displacement sensor. However, as drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotating rapidly, it would be difficult to get the measured data back out to the stationary control circuitry (necessitating the use of slip rings, or the like). Turning briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the reader will recall that drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is directly coupled to drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by drive belt <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the torque variation in drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be accurately measured, this may be easily converted to represent the torque variation in drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The reader will note that drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> spins considerably faster than drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The reduction ratio employed is approximately 9 to 1. Thus, torque measured at drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will have to be multiplied by the reduction ratio to get an equivalent torque at drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A torque measurement taken at drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may then be used to determine the torque at drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by using Equation 11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, It is undesirable to measure actual torque at drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, because a complex mechanical sensor would be required&mdash;adding expense to the system. However, it is possible to approximate the actual torque at drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by measuring motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> within drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The reader is referred to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, which shows the characteristic drive motor torque <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as a function of slip. &ldquo;Slip&rdquo; is a term commonly understood in the art. It is equal to the input frequency of the voltage driving the motor minus the operating frequency of the motor. Drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is typically an induction motor. The excitation, or &ldquo;field&rdquo; winding of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be driven at the input frequency of the applied voltage. The resulting magnetic field rotates within drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the same rate as the input frequency of the voltage applied; i.e., if the voltage applied has a frequency of 1.1 Hz, the field will rotate within drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the rate of 1.1 Hz, or 1.1 revolutions per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The armature of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will rotate at a slightly lower speed. In a sense the armature of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is always &ldquo;chasing&rdquo; the rotating magnetic field, which is revolving at a slightly faster rate. Viewed from an energy balance perspective, it is this difference in speed that causes the motor to produce torque. With these principles in mind, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> will now be explained in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Zero slip point <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> represents the point where the armature speed of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is exactly equal to the speed of the revolving excitation field. The reader will observe that at zero slip point <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> produces no torque. If the armature speed of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> actually exceeds the speed of the revolving excitation field (which is the region to the right of zero slip point <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will produce a negative torque&mdash;meaning that it is operating as a generator rather than a motor. If the armature speed of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is lower than the speed of the revolving excitation field (which is the region to the left of zero slip point <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will produce a positive torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of driving drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> must obviously be operated as a motor&mdash;meaning it will be operated within the region of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the left of zero slip point <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. It is also desirable to minimize motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> within drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in order to reduce heat build-up from resistance losses. Likewise, it is important to obtain fairly large torque output from drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. These two concerns, taken together, mean that it is desirable to operate drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> within the region of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> denoted as linear slip range <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Over linear slip range <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, drive motor torque <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are very nearly linear. They may, in fact, be approximated by a linear function without introducing significant error. From inspecting <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> over linear slip range <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the reader will observe that if motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is known, drive motor torque <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be calculated by multiplying motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by a fixed scalar. This operation may be expressed as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>motor</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;kl*I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>motor</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 12) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> where kl is a fixed scalar, and I<highlight><subscript>motor </subscript></highlight>is motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It is therefore possible to develop a plot for T<highlight><subscript>motor </subscript></highlight>on the basis of motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which will look like the plot of unbalanced torque load <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A small error will be introduced, because neither of the two curves is truly linear, but the error can be ignored as insignificant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thus, by measuring motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, an approximate plot for T<highlight><subscript>motor </subscript></highlight>can be created. T<highlight><subscript>motor </subscript></highlight>is directly related to &Sgr;T (the sum of the torques acting on drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) by the drive ratio. Thus, in the case of a 9 to 1 drive ratio, &Sgr;T is equal to 9 times T<highlight><subscript>motor</subscript></highlight>. The approximate plot for &Sgr;T is then easily created from the plot for T<highlight><subscript>motor</subscript></highlight>. Many conventional techniques may then be used to determine the amplitude of the variation in T<highlight><subscript>motor</subscript></highlight>. Once the torque amplitude is known, it can be fed into the equation previously developed for determining unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;(&Sgr;<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>g*r</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 13) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> where (&Sgr;T)<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>is equal to the torque amplitude. A value for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is thereby obtained. This value, in conjunction with the given value for F<highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>, may then be used to determine the maximum angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which should be used during the water extraction cycle. The previously developed expression for the maximum angular velocity (&ohgr;) is: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;{square root}{square root over (<highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*r</italic></highlight>))}&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, the reader will understand that by measuring motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> while drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is being spun at a relatively low angular velocity (approximately 67 RPM), a good approximation of torque amplitude may be obtained, and from thence the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be calculated. The optimum terminal angular velocity for drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the water extraction cycle can then be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> However, the reader should be aware that actually sensing the current in the motor winding is a difficult proposition. Because an electric motor is a highly inductive load, the current response may be sluggish in comparison to variations in torque and applied voltage. Thus, for many drive motors, if the torque variation is quite rapid, it will be difficult to &ldquo;see&rdquo; this variation by measuring variations in motor current. At a minimum, measuring motor current would require an additional sensor of some complexity. Thus, another approach would be preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Detailed Description&mdash;Slip Measurement Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, it may be observed that motor torque is nearly linearly proportional to slip over linear slip range <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, if a value for slip can be obtained, then a value for motor torque can be calculated. In the preceding section, it was explained how a value for the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> could be calculated once the amplitude of the variation in motor torque is known. Thus, if a value for the amplitude of slip can be obtained, a value for the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If an accurate tachometer is placed on the armature shaft of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, then the actual angular velocity of the armature shaft can be measured. The angular velocity of the armature shaft can easily be converted to a frequency using the expression f&equals;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>/(2*&Pi;), where &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>is the angular velocity of the armature expressed in Radians/s. The frequency of the input voltage to drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is known, because it is determined by the motor controller circuitry. Slip is then the difference between the two frequencies. The value for slip can then be converted to a value for motor torque by using a linearized approximation of drive motor torque <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> While the slip measurement method does work, it requires the use of a tachometer on drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Further, this tachometer will have to have a very accurate resolution in order to measure the subtle variations in angular velocity caused by unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It would therefore add considerable cost to the system. Once again, another approach would be preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Detailed Description&mdash;Power Phase Angle Method (Preferred Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it may be observed that unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> varies sinusoidally, at the same frequency as unbalanced torque load <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, it should be possible to obtain an approximate value for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by evaluating the curve for unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This is in fact the case, as will be explained in this section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Accurate measurement of unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be obtained by placing a tachometer on drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Such a tachometer would constitute an additional unwanted expense, however. As one of the stated goals of the present invention is to avoid the need for additional sensors, another method of measuring unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows exemplary curves for motor drive voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, where &ldquo;motor drive voltage&rdquo; is the voltage applied to drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;motor terminal current&rdquo; is the resulting current in the field winding. Motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is related to motor drive voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by Ohm&apos;s law. However, as drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> represents a highly inductive load, motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will always lag behind motor drive voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as is shown graphically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The phase lag of motor terminal current <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is referred to as power phase lag <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The reader will no doubt be aware that voltage and current do not have the same units and that one would not expect a plot of these two values to show the same amplitude. The plots of the two exemplary curves depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> have been scaled to give them matching amplitudes, which aids visual understanding of the phase lag phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Power phase lag <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is directly proportional to the angular velocity of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This fact is well known in the art, and follows from a simple understanding of inductive loads. As the angular velocity of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is increased, the frequency of motor drive voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> must also increase. This fact means that the voltage is cycling between its positive and negative extremes at a faster and faster rate. The current induced by the voltage therefore tends to lag further behind the voltage as motor speed increases. This fact is critical, because it means that if one knows the value for power phase lag <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> one can develop a value for the angular velocity of drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and from thence a value for the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The reader should be aware that power phase lag <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is often expressed in terms of a &ldquo;power phase angle.&rdquo; The value for the power phase angle, which is a common term within the art, is developed from power phase lag <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by the following expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&PHgr;&equals;(powerphaselag)*<highlight><italic>f*</italic></highlight>2*&Pi;&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 14) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> where &ldquo;&PHgr;&rdquo; represents the power phase angle, and &ldquo;f &rdquo;represents the frequency of motor drive voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;2*&Pi;&rdquo; term is included in order to express the result in radians, which is the unit typically used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The electronic controller used to provide voltage to drive motor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is commonly called a Pulse Width Modulated Inverter Drive (&ldquo;PWM Inverter Drive&rdquo;). While an explanation of the operation of a PWM Inverter Drive is beyond the scope of this disclosure, the reader is referred to U.S. Pat. No.5,627,447 to Unsworth et.al. (1997), which contains an excellent description. The disclosure of the Unsworth et.al. device describes how power phase lag, and therefore power phase angle, may be determined using existing components within the PWM Inverter Drive. The reader should be advised that the Unsworth et.al. disclosure refers to the power phase angle as the &ldquo;current phase angle,&rdquo; a synonymous term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It is the intention of the present inventors to incorporate the PWM Inverter Drive disclosed in Unsworth et.al. in their present invention. The Unsworth et.al. device will provide the amplitude of the variation in the power phase angle. Thus, the reader will appreciate that the measurement of the amplitude of the variation in the power phase angle may be accomplished using the existing motor controller, and without the need for additional external sensors. The value for the amplitude of variation in the power phase angle may then be used to calculate the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as will be explained in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The amplitude of variation in the power phase angle is directly proportional to the amplitude of variation in the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This expression may be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>)amplitude</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;k</italic></highlight>2*(&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 15) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a plot of angular velocity for drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The plot shows angular velocity after it has reached an average value of 7.059 Rad/s (67 RPM), which is the relatively low speed found suitable for determining the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not experiencing acceleration, other than that caused by unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is seen to vary sinusoidally from the flat curve of balanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The curve labeled <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> results from a perfectly balanced drum. The curve labeled <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> results from the introduction of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the variation in power phase angle (&PHgr;) for the same state. Unbalanced power phase angle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is observed to vary sinusoidally from balanced power phase angle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, with the same frequency as unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. From studying <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the reader will observe that the unbalanced power phase angle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> does indeed vary linearly with unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. By measuring the amplitude of unbalanced power phase angle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, it is possible to determine the amplitude of unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as demonstrated by Equation 15. This fact is significant, because if the amplitude of unbalanced power phase angle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is known, it is possible to determine the amplitude of unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and then the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 17</cross-reference> illustrate the effect that variations in the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has on (&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight>. In every figure, drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotating with an average angular velocity of 7.059 Rad/s (67 RPM). The total clothing load is constant at 15 kg. For <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> had a magnitude of 1 kg. The resulting amplitude of the variation in angular velocity is 0.0542 Rad/s. For <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the magnitude was increased to 2 kg. The resulting amplitude variation was then 0.1089 Rad/s. The following table aids the comprehension of these results:

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a plot of (&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>vs. the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>). The reader will observe that the relationship does indeed appear to be linear. This may be expressed by the equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;(&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/k</italic></highlight>3&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 16) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> where k3 is a constant equal to the slope of the line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Although the curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> appears to be perfectly linear, the reader should be aware that it is not. There are actually slight off-linear variations in the curve, caused by frictional and inertial coupling effects. However, as is made plain by the figure, the curve may be assumed to be linear without introducing appreciable error. Thus, if a value for (&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>is known, a value for the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be easily determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> However, as was explained above, a value for the angular velocity of drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not generally known without an additional sensor. A more preferable solution is to develop an equation that calculates the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the basis of the amplitude of variation in the power phase angle, which is known from the use of the PWM Inverter Drive disclosed in Unsworth et.al. The needed equation was previously presented as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;k</italic></highlight>2*(&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 15) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> This equation may easily be rewritten as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;k</italic></highlight>2/(&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 16) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> From this equation, it is apparent that if (&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>is linearly proportional to the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (which it is&mdash;<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>), then (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>should be linearly proportional as well. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> demonstrates that this is indeed the case. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the reader will observe that the plot of (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>vs. the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is almost perfectly linear. A solution for the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may then be written as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;(&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/k</italic></highlight>4&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 17) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> where k4 is the slope of the line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Thus, by obtaining a value for the amplitude of variation in the power phase angle, one can calculate the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This figure may then be fed into Equation 2, presented again below, to solve for optimum angular velocity during the water extraction cycle: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;{square root}{square root over (<highlight><italic>F</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*r</italic></highlight>))}&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Thus, the power phase angle approach can solve for the optimum angular velocity without using any additional sensors. Instead, it makes use of the measurement capabilities contained with the PWM Inverter Drive. It is therefore the preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The reader should be aware that the previous development of the mathematical equations explaining the dynamic behavior of washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not really necessary to the application of the technique disclosed. Turning again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, it is apparent that if one measures the variation in (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>while placing different unbalanced masses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, one may empirically develop a plot similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, and thereby obtain a value for the constant k4. It is therefore easy to design a controlled experiment in which a table of values for (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>is constructed in relation to different values for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. There are then two options for using the data to control washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: (1) use the data to solve for the constant k4, and then use Equation 17 and Equation 2 to solve for &ohgr;; or (2) store the data as a memory look-up table, so that once the value for (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>is determined, a memory retrieval function retrieves the corresponding value for M<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, and Equation 2 is then used to solve for &ohgr;. Thus, for a washing machine having a construction similar to washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it will always be possible to calculate the optimum terminal angular velocity during the water extraction cycle. It is not necessary to develop a mathematical model of the system dynamics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> At several points in the previous disclosure, the statement was made that the magnitude determined for unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, though fairly accurate, is not exact. It does include some error. This error primarily results from the fact that it is impractical to determine the total clothing load within drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without using additional sensors. Variations in total clothing load will obviously affect the magnitude of the variations induced in angular acceleration, angular velocity, and power phase angle, for a given magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This fact is made plain by reviewing Equation 8, presented again below: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&agr;&equals;1<highlight><italic>/I</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>*(<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;kf*&ohgr;&minus;M</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*g*r*</italic></highlight>cos(&thgr;))&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 8) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> I<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>represents the total moment of inertia for the rotating system. Increasing the total clothing load will obviously increase I<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>, with a consequent decrease in angular acceleration (&agr;). All the values discussed previously, except torque, are functions of angular acceleration. Thus, a variation in the total clothing load results in a shift in the curves for angular acceleration, angular velocity, and power phase angle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a plot of angular acceleration vs. time for a load imbalance of 3 kg. The three different curves shown for unbalanced angular velocity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> represent the different results for total clothing loads of 15 kg, 19 kg, and 23 kg. As may be readily observed, the variation in angular velocity amplitude <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is relatively small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The moment of inertia for the rotating mass within washing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is 8.3 kg*m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. This figure represents the moment of inertia when drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is completely empty. The additional moment of inertia for a saturated clothing load varies in the range between 1.95 kg*m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 3.00 kg*m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. These figures correspond to a saturated clothing mass in the range of 15 kg to 23 kg. Thus, the moment of inertia introduced by the saturated clothing load is relatively small in comparison to the moment of inertia already present when drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is empty. From this fact. one would expect that the error introduced by variation in total clothing load would be relatively small. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the reader will see that this is indeed the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The upper curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> represents (&ohgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude </subscript></highlight>vs. unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for a 15 kg total clothing load. The middle curve corresponds to a 19 kg total clothing load, and the bottom curve corresponds to a 23 kg total clothing load. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the same study in terms of (&PHgr;)<highlight><subscript>amplitude</subscript></highlight>. Using the middle, or 19 kg, curve, will allow a fairly accurate computation of the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over a wide range of total clothing loads. Thus, the power phase angle method disclosed may be used without knowing the total clothing load, and without introducing a significant error in the calculation of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the reader will appreciate that the proposed invention allows the determination of the magnitude of unbalanced mass <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which value is then used to calculate the optimum angular velocity for drum <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the water extraction cycle. Furthermore, the proposed invention has additional advantages in that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> 1. In the case of the power phase angle method, it can determine the imbalance in the spinning load without the need for additional sensors; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> 2. It provide adjustment of the terminal spin speed over a continuous range, rather than choosing from a few discrete spin velocities; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> 3. In the event of a significant load imbalance, it provides a reduced terminal spin speed, rather than a machine shutdown; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> 4. It can determine the load imbalance with sufficient accuracy to calculate the appropriate terminal spin speed, without having a value for the total clothing load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Although the preceding description contains significant detail, it should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but rather as providing illustrations of the preferred embodiments of the invention.
