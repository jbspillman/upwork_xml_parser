<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A luminaire for ceilings, which permits improved packing density for warehousing and shipping. The reflector of the luminaire is designed to permit it to be shipped in a flattened or nested state. This increases the packing density and eliminates shipping and warehousing boxes whose volume is 95% air. An assembled luminaire comprises three or four parts: the reflector, a ballasted-socket, a lamp, and an optional diffuser or lens. The reflector, ballasted-socket, lamp, and optional lens are either shipped separately in bulk packs or shipped in kits containing the one or more sets of components to build the luminaire. When the luminaires are installed at the job site, a ballasted-socket is inserted into a mounting aperture in the reflector; a lamp is inserted into the ballasted-socket; the ballasted-socket is connected to a power source, and the assembly is placed into the ceiling opening. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND&mdash;FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to luminaires in general, and compact, lightweight, field-assembled luminaires in particular. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Current fluorescent luminaires are connected to the utility power line via conduit, BX, or Romex type cable. Since the fluorescent luminaire is connected directly to the utility power line via a 15 or 20-amp branch circuit, the luminaire must be designed to enclose and protect the input leads to the fluorescent lamp ballast, the lamp sockets, and the interconnecting leads between the ballast and the lamp sockets. In order to provide the necessary protection, fluorescent luminaires are made out of relatively heavy gauge steel to meet specific standards set by Underwriters&apos; Laboratories (UL), such as, UL1570. UL requires that heavy gauge metal be used to insure that the luminaire can withstand a certain degree of abuse without exposing leads, electrical components, the ballast, current carrying parts or devices with exposed metal which could constitute a shock or fire hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to the structural requirement set out in the UL standard, a typical 2&times;4 foot luminaire can weigh over 30 pounds and a 2&times;2 foot fixture can weigh over 15 pounds. Since current luminaires act as electrical enclosures for the fluorescent ballast and the interconnecting leads, raceway covers (also made out of heavy gauge steel) are provided to contain the potentially hazardous wiring. Luminaires, currently on the market, often contain 25 to 30 stamped metal parts plus the fasteners to hold them all together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because these luminaires contain such a large number of parts, they are assembled in factories, where they are packaged in individual boxes. Then they are loaded onto trucks, shipped to and stored in warehouses. They are then loaded onto different trucks and delivered to lighting wholesalers and retailers or job sites where they are stored until they are installed. In each case, the luminaires occupy a significant amount of floor space and volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Once at the job site the luminaires are lifted overhead into position within the ceiling grid. This is no easy task since each 2&times;4 luminaire can weigh 30 pounds or more. The grid system and the supporting wires are required to be sufficiently strong to accommodate this extra weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent lamp ballasts currently in production are designed to operate from 15 or 20 amp branch circuits, which are typically 120, 240, or 277 volts; 60 Hertz. Due to the high energy levels available from these branch circuits, the lines connecting the input to the ballast to the branch circuit is required by the local electrical code to be run in conduit, BX, or Romex. The output leads connect the ballast to the lamp sockets and supply voltages and currents, which do not meet the limits of the National Electrical Code requirements for either Class II or Class III wiring. Therefore, this wiring too must be provided with special protective encasement by the luminaire. This is generally accomplished by designing wire raceways in the luminaire to meet special requirements established by Underwriters Laboratories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The ballasts currently in production are either magnetic ballasts or electronic ballasts. The input power is provided from 50 or 60 Hertz line voltage and the output of the ballast is connected to a lamp socket or sockets via interconnect wiring. The magnetic ballast generally consists of a transformer with a current limited output and a power-factor correction capacitor connected across the input. Since the magnetic ballast is operating at 60 Hertz, the size of the metal can of a ballast capable of handling 60 watts of output power is 2.25&Prime; wide by 1.5&Prime; high by 8&Prime; long and weighs about 3 pounds. Electronic ballasts are generally manufactured in the same size package but weigh 1.25 to 2.5 pounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, several objects and advantages of this invention are a lighter weight, lower cost luminaire with fewer parts, requiring significantly reduced storage and shipping volume, while still maintaining an attractive appearance and providing easy assembly. This is achieved by incorporating the lamp socket into the insulated enclosure of the ballast, thus enclosing any leads or terminals that exceed class II or class III limits within the insulated ballast enclosure. This allows the luminaire to be manufactured out of lighter weight less costly material and in most cases made as a single piece with no factory assembly of the luminaire. Due to the field assembly and the unique design of the reflector portion of the luminaire, the luminaires can be nested one within another or, in another embodiment, shipped in a flattened condition. This greatly reduces the shipping and storage volume. In certain embodiments, the luminaire is capable of being assembled and installed by someone requiring no training as an electrician. For ceilings requiring a fire rating, a unique enclosure is used that provides the added weight and fire resistance characteristics necessary to meet the applicable tests and standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to a design of field-assembled luminaires, primarily for suspended ceilings, which permits one luminaire reflector to be nested within one or more identical luminaire reflectors to minimize shipping and warehouse space. The lamp socket is manufactured as an integral part of the ballast, and clips into and is supported by the reflector. If a lens is desired to block direct view of the lamp, it is not necessary to provide the lens as part of a hinged door. The fact that the reflector can be made from much lighter material (plastic, metal, etc.) permits the lamps to be replaced by removing an adjacent ceiling tile and sliding the reflector over the open space in the grid to access the lamp or, in the case of compact fluorescent lamps, to replace the lamp from the rear. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION&mdash;FIRST RELATED FAMILY OF EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a pictorial drawing of a ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is made of electrically insulating material and encases the electronic circuitry used to provide the necessary interface between a power source and a gas discharge lamp. The back of four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is encased by the enclosure <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is provided with four output terminals <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and with lamp support clips <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to support the weight of a lamp when it is mounted in the four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Clips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are provided on alternate sides of the enclosure <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to hold the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in position when mounted on a luminaire reflector. The cable assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is used to connect the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a power source via the power plug <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. An optional power receptacle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be provided as part of the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This permits another ballasted-socket to be plugged into it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic of a typical ballasted-socket circuit. The power plug <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided for connection to a power source. The output terminals <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are part of the four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and provide voltage to heat lamp filaments and current-limited voltage to provide lamp current. Transformer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is used to step-up or step-down the lamp starting voltage as required by the particular lamp to be used and to supply filament voltage from the filament windings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Ballasting capacitor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> limits the current supplied to the lamp after lamp ignition. Tank capacitor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and tank inductor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, in concert with the reflected load and ballasting capacitor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, form a parallel resonant tuned circuit. The optional power receptacle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel with the leads to power plug <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the instant invention showing the major components. The 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is shown as a truncated pyramid. Edge A <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, edge B <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, edge C <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and edge D <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are each slightly less than two feet in length to permit the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be placed into a 2 foot by 2 foot ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A one-half inch lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided around the circumference of the lower portion of the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to added rigidity to the reflector and to center the reflector within the 2-foot by 2 foot ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The material used, in this embodiment for the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is a 0.060 inch thick, UV stabilized, white plastic with a HB flame rating. It should be noted that if the luminaire is intended to be used in a ceiling requiring a fire rating, it may be necessary to use metal in place of plastic to achieve the desired fire rating. Using plastic permits a wide variety of shapes to easily be manufactured by vacuum forming or injection molding. The top plane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> measures approximately 12 inches by 12 inches. A typical height for the luminaire is 3 and &frac34; inches. The angle of inclination of each of the sides is slightly greater than 30 degrees. The 12-inch by 12-inch dimension of the top plane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is determined by the lamp chosen for the luminaire. For this embodiment a General Electric F55 2D lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is approximately 8 inches by 8 inches, is used. An aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is provided centered in the top plane of the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to receive ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has notches <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on alternate sides to receive mating clips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located on the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to insure that the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rigidly held in place once installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows how the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned relative to the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The clips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are to insure adequate lateral force is available to maintain the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in position when the clips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are inserted into the notches <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The 2D lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a General Electric 2D lamp or similar type. The 2D lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> consists of a single fluorescent tube <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is bent to resemble two capital &ldquo;Ds&rdquo; back to back. The two ends of the fluorescent tube <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each terminating at a plastic support structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A four-pin recessed plug <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is provided in the approximate center of the plastic support structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The lamp also being provided with depressions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on alternate sides of the recessed plug <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to receive the lamp support clips <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The optional 2&prime; by 2&prime; lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be a simple plastic diffuser, parabolic louver, baffle or any of the standard lens materials used with conventional luminaires. The dimension of each edge of the optional 2&prime; by 2&prime; lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is slightly less than two feet in length to permit the optional 2&prime; by 2&prime; lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be placed into the 2 foot by 2 foot ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Adjacent grid opening <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is one of the four possible grid openings that share a common side with the grid opening containing the luminaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows how the overall system is installed in a suspended ceiling. A grid system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> made up of T-bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is suspended from a permanent ceiling <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> using support wires <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The T-bars <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are installed to provide either a 2&prime; by 2&prime; or a 2&prime; by 4&prime; grid. Luminaire assemblies <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are placed into the grid as required to provide the desired level of lighting. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the luminaire assemblies <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are shown in every other opening of every other row. The remaining openings are filled with ceiling panels <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Mounted onto the permanent ceiling <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are a series of four-port energy-limited power sources <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, one four-port energy-limited power sources <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for every four luminaires assemblies <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The four-port energy-limited power sources <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are connected to the utility power line using conduit, BX, or Romex 60 as required by the local electrical code. The four-port energy-limited power source <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is connected to the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using a lightweight cable assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is affixed to the top of the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">OPERATION&mdash;FIRST RELATED FAMILY OF EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> encapsulates the ballast circuitry, all wiring, plus the connections between the ballast circuitry and the four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>; therefore, the ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is the only part of the luminaire which must meet the stringent requirements regarding the enclosure of fluorescent lighting fixtures established by Underwriters&apos; Laboratories, Inc. in UL1570. Input power is provided to the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through power plug <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and cable assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. An alternative connection technique, not shown, is to use insulation displacement connectors built into the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into which a multi-conductor cable is inserted and a cover or cam is slid or rotated into place to make the connection via contact point which pierce the insulation, similar to the plugs that are added to lamp cords. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is typical of a circuit, which can be used in a ballasted-socket assembly or ballasted-cover-plate. In a preferred embodiment, the circuit is powered from a class II or class III power-limited supply. As a result, the National Electrical Code does not require the interconnecting wires between the power supply and the ballasted-socket assembly to be run in conduit or BX, but permits much lighter weight non-armored cable to be used. In order to minimize the physical size of the electronic components used for the ballast circuitry (tank capacitor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, tank inductor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, ballasting capacitor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and transformer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) an operating frequency in the range of 18 kHz to 100 kHz is preferred. The filament windings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> provide voltage to heat the lamp filaments for rapid start operation. By increasing the secondary turns and eliminating the filament windings, instant start operation can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> complete luminaire consists of a ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, an optional lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The reflector merely supports the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and reflects the light down to the room being illuminated, but does not enclose any wires, transformers, capacitors, ballasts, current-carrying parts, devices with exposed metal, leads or terminals for field connection of supply wires. Therefore, the enclosure requirements of UL1570 do not have to be met by the reflector portion of the luminaire. This means that the reflector can be manufactured out of much lighter gauge material than that required for the equivalent conventional luminaire. The luminaires can be shipped to the job site in bulk (i.e. the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflectors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can packed by nesting one reflector within another). As a result, the equivalent of ten conventional 2&prime; by 2&prime; troffer type luminaires can be placed in on container measuring 2&prime; by 2&prime; by 6&Prime; thick and weigh a total of only 25 pounds including the reflectors, ballasted-sockets, and lenses. Ten conventional 2&prime; by 2&prime; troffers would normally be packed in individual boxes measuring 2&prime; by 2&prime; by 5&Prime; thick and create a stack over four feet tall weighing 150 pounds. It would take sixty nestable luminaires to add up to 150 pounds and they would only stand 12 inches tall. Each additional reflector increases the height of the stack by only slightly more than the material thickness of the reflector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made out of a single sheet of material, this piece can be inexpensively manufactured by being vacuum formed or injection molded in the case of plastic, or either drawn or fabricated out of a single sheet of steel or aluminum. In situations where the luminaire is installed without a diffuser for a lens, it is possible to provide a textured finish on the reflecting side of the reflector to greatly reduce the amount of glare that would otherwise be produced by the glossy painted surface of a conventional luminaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In its basic form, the nestable luminaire can be manufactured with a single piece reflector. This is the only part requiring significant tooling. It does not require the tooling of numerous channels, covers and clips that is required for the equivalent conventional luminaire. Thus, the tooling cost to get into the luminaire business using the nestable luminaire approach is dramatically less than the cost to get into the business of manufacturing conventional luminaire designs. Again, due to the fact that the physical volume required to ship a finished reflector is no more and in some cases actually less than the volume to ship the raw material, the luminaire reflector can be manufactured anywhere in the world and shipped to the job site for 2% of what it would cost to ship conventional luminaires. Therefore, the suppliers of the luminaire reflectors are not limited to domestic vendors. There is no factory wiring; therefore, there is no manufacturing space or labor required for wiring the nestable luminaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the entire luminaire can be assembled from three components, the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An optional lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be added to reduce glare. As stated previously, one key feature of the nestable luminaire is its dramatic reduction in shipping and warehousing volume. In order to achieve the maximum reduction in volume the luminaire is shipped disassembled. It is therefore necessary that the luminaire is capable of being easily assembled at the job site. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is merely clipped into the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If a lens is used, the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is placed into the ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which also has the lamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> installed, is placed over the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from an adjacent grid opening <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. This installation process becomes a much easier task since the weight of a 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire is less than 3 pounds instead of 15 and in the case of a 2&prime; by 4&prime; luminaire the weight is less than 6 pounds instead of nearly 30. It should be noted that a significant portion of the shipping advantage of the nestable luminaire could still be achieved with ballasted-socket installed before shipping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, once the luminaire has been placed into the suspended ceiling grid system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> the cable assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is plugged into a four-port energy-limited power source <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (for an example of an acceptable energy-limited power source see U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,603). Since in the case of an energy-limited system the wiring between the power source and the luminaire is class II or class III, it is only necessary to have an electrician install the four-port energy-limited power sources <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The wiring between the power source and the luminaire can be installed by unskilled labor, because the wiring merely plugs together. Even where unions may require the luminaires to be installed by electricians, the speed at which the luminaires are installed will be very much increased and installation cost very much reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows how the reflectors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be nested one within another and one possible way of packaging the luminaires as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits. In this case, six reflectors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are packed with six ballasted-sockets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> packed in the center of the top reflector. The lenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are then packed on top of the upper reflector. This kit of six luminaires will fit in roughly the same size container that is currently used for a single equivalent conventional luminaire. Another alternative for both the DIY market and the commercial market is to ship the reflectors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ballasted-sockets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, lenses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and lamps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> separately in bulk, perhaps 50 to 100 per container. This way the do-it-yourselfer or commercial user can mix and match reflectors, ballasted-sockets, lenses and lamps. Also, if the aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the mounting technique of the ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were standardized, then the end user can choose a ballasted-socket from one of a number of ballast manufacturers on a reflector assembly from one of several luminaire manufacturers. The shelf space savings generated by the reduced volume of the nestable luminaire is especially important to the lighting retailer and home improvement center, where the shelf space is particularly valuable, since the merchandise is often warehoused on the store shelves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows how the same invention can be applied to a 2&prime; by 4&prime; luminaire. The 2&prime; by 4&prime; reflector <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> contains one or more apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The ballasted-sockets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are clipped into the 2&prime; by 4&prime; reflector <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The lamps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are inserted into the ballasted-sockets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The luminaires are then installed into the ceiling grid as previously discussed. To minimize the wiring above the suspended ceiling, each ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be provided with a power receptacle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> allowing one ballasted-socket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be plugged into the preceding one with only one cord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> run back to the power source. All comments regarding the nesting, shipping, and warehousing previously discussed also apply to this type of luminaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is similar to the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> except the ballast circuitry is mounted on a cover plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. A compact fluorescent lamp socket <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is mounted on the cover plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> also. In the configuration shown, access to the compact fluorescent lamp socket <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is through the cover plate. In other configurations, the lamp socket <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the cover plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> without requiring that the base of a lamp extend through the cover plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the cover plate <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is made slightly larger than the base of a compact fluorescent lamp. As an alternative to having a cable assembly as part of the ballasted-socket, the ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is shown with two parallel-connected power receptacles <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A separate power cable assembly <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is provided with power plugs <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> at each end to interconnect the ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Using a ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> permits relamping from the rear of the fixture as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A compact fluorescent lamp <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is inserted into the compact fluorescent lamp socket of the ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The compact fluorescent lamp is inserted through the circular aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The two mounting tabs <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) are placed through the large ends of the two keyhole slots <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> located on both sides of circular aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is then rotated to lock it in place. If more than one lamp is used, the same procedure is followed for the remaining lamps. If a diffuser is used for the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the luminaire can be sealed by removing the paper backing from one side of the double-sided tape <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and attach it to the bottom side of lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> around the perimeter of the luminaire. The lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is then placed into the ceiling grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The backing is removed from the double-sided tape <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The sealable reflector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is then inserted through an adjacent grid opening and placed over the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Once in place, the double-sided tape adheres to the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and forms a sealed unit minimizing the infiltration of dirt. When a lamp reaches its end of life, the ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is removed from the rear of the sealable reflector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the lamp is replaced with a new one and the ballasted-cover-plate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is reinstalled. It may be more cost effective in some cases to have the double-sided tape <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> preinstalled on the lens or the reflector by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the sides of the reflector can be designed to be much steeper. As the sides of the reflector get steeper the improvement in packing density is somewhat decreased and is a function of the angle of the sides plus the thickness of the material used to manufacture the reflector, but significant improvement in the packing density compared to individually boxed luminaires is still achieved. For instance, if the reflector is designed such that a second reflector nested over it creates a gap of 1 inch between the top planes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the two reflectors, and the height of each reflector is approximately 4 inches, then when ten reflectors are shipped nested, they will still only occupy roughly one-third of the volume of individually boxed conventional luminaires. With a design that creates a gap between top planes, the option exists to supply the ballasted-socket assemblies preinstalled either on the backside as has been shown, or with minor modifications to the mounting arrangements and power input connection it can be preinstalled on the inside of the reflector. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The First Related Family of Embodiments demonstrates how the nestable luminaire is used with 2D lamps and compact fluorescent lamps. The second related family of embodiments applies the same concept to circular lamps, linear lamps, U-lamps and long-twin-tube type lamps. To accommodate these lamps, the sides of the reflector of the luminaire are made steeper to make the larger top plane required by these lamps. The concept is still the same in that the luminaire is comprised of the same three or four basic parts: a ballasted-socket, a reflector, a lamp or lamps, and an optional lens. The reflectors are capable of being nested one within another to minimize shipping volume. The ballasted-sockets can be shipped either packaged within the top reflector or shipped separately in bulk. The luminaires are then easily assembled at the time of installation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an exploded view of a nestable luminaire for linear lamps. Reflector for linear lamps <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> contains at least one pair of apertures A <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to receive the main body of ballasted-socket for linear lamps <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and remote lamp socket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The main body of ballasted-socket for linear lamps <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> contains one or more power receptacles <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> allows the width of the aperture to increase to permit insertion of a lampholder. The main body of the ballasted-socket for linear lamps <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the remote lamp socket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are provided with a ramp <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a recess <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The main body of the ballasted-socket for linear lamps is connected to the remote bi-pin lampholder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> by remote bi-pin lampholder cable <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. This cable can be a single conductor for instant start lamps, a pair of insulated conductors or a pair of insulated conductors within a cable for rapid start lamps. For rapid start lamps, when the ballasted-socket is powered from a Class II or Class III circuit, the conductors in the remote bi-pin lampholder cable <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> become a Class II circuit since the voltage between the conductors is nominally only 3.6 volts and if the input to the ballasted-socket is power limited, the output between these conductors is also power limited to the same power level. Therefore, no special enclosure requirements apply regarding UL 1570. If the ballasted-socket for linear lamps is powering rapid start lamps and is powered from a non-Class II or III circuit, the remote lamp socket cable <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> needs to be enclosed appropriately to meet the requirements of UL1570 or a circuit component, such as, a capacitor must be added within the ballasted-socket enclosure in series with one of the conductors to limit the current available between the two conductors to a level that is within the Class II limits. The length of the remote bi-pin lampholder cable <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is determined by the length of the linear lamps used in the luminaire. In some cases, it may be desirable to enclose this cable in a rigid housing to mechanically connect the main body of the ballasted-socket for linear lamps <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to the remote bi-pin lampholder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Linear lamps <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are shown above lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The reflector for linear lamps is shown without a lip around the perimeter of the luminaire. For T5 rapid start lamps the reflector can be made with or without a lip since a nominal 2 foot lamp has an overall length of 21.6 inches and a nominal 4 foot lamp has an overall length of 45.2 inches. T8 and T12 lamps are only 0.25 inches shorter than their nominal length. Therefore, there is no room to add the lip to these reflectors. In addition, the lampholders are held in by tab <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. This tab allows the lampholders to be spaced sufficiently to accept T8 and T12 lamps. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows how a nestable figure is adapted to use circular lamps. The ballasted-socket for circular lamps <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has an integral circular lamp socket <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> mounted at approximately 45 degrees from vertical and toward the center of the ballasted-socket. All the ballast circuitry is contained within the housing of the ballasted-socket; therefore, the ballasted-socket is the only part of the luminaire that needs to meet the structural and electrical requirements of UL1570. At the time of installation, the ballasted-socket for circular lamps <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is attached to the steep-sided reflector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by inserting circular lamp socket <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> through oval aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and engaging clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into ballast clip slot <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The lamp retaining clips <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are each inserted into lamp retaining clip slots <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The circular lamp <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is then forced over the lamp retaining clips <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> with the circular lamp plug <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> engaging the circular lamp socket <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>.

The backing from one side of the double-sided tape <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is removed and placed into the grid with the exposed side against the lens. The backing is then removed from the other side of the tape and the assembled reflector is placed into the grid over the lens, sealing the lens to the reflector. Once sealed it is virtually impossible for dust and insects to accumulate within the luminaire. It may be advantageous to provide the tape pre-installed either on the lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or on the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Alternately instead of using tape, a Velcro type product can be used on the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the loops attached to the opposite piece. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The First and Second Related Family of Embodiments demonstrate how the nestable luminaire is capable of being nested one within another to minimize shipping volume. That approach is particularly desirable when large quantities of luminaries are being shipped and warehoused in bulk. The current embodiment addresses the situation where a single luminaire is packaged separately or a small number of luminaires are packaged together. In this embodiment, the reflector is flattened to minimize shipping and warehousing volume. For luminaires that use the ballasted-socket, the construction requirements in Underwriters&apos; Laboratory standard UL 1570 that apply to conventional luminaires do not apply; therefore, the luminaire can be made of much lighter materials including plastic. In addition, the ballast-to-socket wiring is all contained in the ballasted-socket assembly. Thus, the luminaire merely supports the ballasted-socket and lamps, but does not need to protect any electrical wiring. Thus, the luminaire does not need to be constructed as rigidly as conventional luminaires. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When the luminaire is installed, the side panels <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> of the flattenable luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are bent back inward until their adjoining edges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> again meet. If the reflector is provided with interlocking tabs <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and interlocking notches <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the side panels <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are snapped together. If the flattenable reflector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is not provided with the interlocking feature, the edges of the side panels are held closed using clamps or tape applied over each of the adjacent adjoining edges <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> on the back side of the flattenable reflector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Once the flattenable reflector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is assembled, a ballasted-socket of the type described in previous embodiments is inserted into the flattenable luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a lamp or lamps are plugged into the ballasted-socket.

These can be eliminated and the adjoining edges can be sealed with tape or held together with clamps. The truncated pyramid shape of the reflector shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is representative of the many shapes that can be implemented with the instant invention. For instance, there is no particular requirement that the side panels <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> be sloped as in the nestable embodiments described in previous embodiments. The side panels can be vertical if necessary and adjacent side panels do not need to be similarly shaped. It is only necessary that the adjoining edges have the same length. Consequently, any basic shape currently used for troffer type luminaires can be accommodated using this invention. </paragraph>

The flattenable luminaire reflector can also accommodate the lamp and ballasted-socket arrangement depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> where one or more lamps can be installed and replaced from the rear of the luminaire. Using this configuration of ballasted-socket and lamps further allows the lens or diffuser to be attached to the front of the luminaire reflector to provide a sealed luminaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An example of an alternate way of implementing this embodiment is to slit the four edges that join the four side panels of the truncated pyramid of a reflector from a nestable luminaire, discussed in previous embodiments. The reflector is packaged with the top plane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> forced down until it is coplanar with the side panels <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The reflector is then shipped in this flattened condition. Upon removal from the packaging, the reflector will naturally try to assume, at least in part, its original shape. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is typical of how a fire-rated luminaire cover is used with one of the examples of nestable luminaires described in prior embodiments. A fire-rated ceiling grid <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is suspended from the permanent ceiling, floor support, or roof supports of a room. At regular intervals, 2&prime; by 2&prime; lenses are placed into the ceiling grid openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is positioned over a 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted through fire-rated luminaire cover aperture <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and into aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, using clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to hold it in place. 2D lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then inserted into four-pin lamp socket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This assembly is placed into grid opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over the 2&prime; by 2&prime; lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The ballasted-socket is connected to a source of power as described in prior embodiments. Fire-rated ceiling panels <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> are placed into the ceiling grid openings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that do not contain luminaires. Since the fire-rated luminaire cover is made of the same material as the fire-rated ceiling panels <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> or a material with a superior fire rating compared to the fire-rated ceiling panels <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the whole ceiling system can be fire rated, even though the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of a material that would not pass the ANSI/UL 263 test without the additional protection of the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. A further benefit of using the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is that the combined weight of the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, fire-rated luminaire reflector cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the 2D lamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> result in a weight greater than 1 pound per square foot, eliminating the need for hold down clips on the luminaire that would be required for luminaires weighing less than 1 pound per square foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> as separate item from the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This approach allows flexibility in that the same luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used in locations that need a fire-rated ceiling system as well as those location that do not. Under certain circumstances it may be desirable to provide the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> as an integral part of the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by precisely matching the shape of the back of the luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the front side of the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and bonding the two pieces together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a cross sectional view of several fire-rated luminaire covers <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> demonstrating how fire-rated luminaire covers designed for nestable or flattenable luminaire reflectors can themselves be nested to save shipping volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Since in most cases the material used for the 2&prime; by 2&prime; luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will need to have a flame rating of only 94 HB to meet UL listing requirements under UL1570, the material will provide an additional source of heat in the proximate vicinity of the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the cover may need to be increased slightly over the thickness of the fire-rated ceiling panels <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the luminaire cover being used with a luminaire reflector of what has been previously described as a nestable luminaire. This invention will work equally well with a flattenable luminaire reflector and will work with luminaires, which are neither nestable nor flattenable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the instant invention uses the flattenable approach described in a previous embodiment as applied to the luminaire reflector. Instead of using a single molded part, which has the same general shape as the luminaire, the fire-rated luminaire cover is fabricated out of five separate pieces of fire-rated ceiling tile material. One piece for the top plane and four identical pieces to make up the four sides of the truncated pyramid of the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Each of the five pieces having mitered edges and laminated at least at its adjoining edges to a flexible member to act as a continuous hinge. The assembly so arranged to allow it to be shipped with all five panels lying in the same plane and to permit each of the four sides to be folded inward an equal amount to assume the shape of the truncated pyramid. This assembly is then used in the same manner as discussed previously for the molded fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In the case of the flattenable luminaire described in the third embodiment of this specification, the fire-rated ceiling tile material can be attached directly to the five panels of the flattenable luminaire. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although the description above describes the application of the fire-rated luminaire cover in terms of nestable and flattenable luminaires, the invention also applies to luminaires, which are not nestable or flattenable. The fire-rated luminaire cover is described as a separate unit which is placed over a separate luminaire, but a fire-rated luminaire can be constructed by lining the back side of a luminaire made out of light-weight reflective material with fire-rated ceiling tile material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in its most basic form the fire-rated luminaire cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can be used as the luminaire reflector directly without the need for a separate plastic or metal luminaire reflector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This can be accomplished by merely reinforcing the area around the fire-rated luminaire cover aperture <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which engages the clip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the ballasted-socket assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a harder material such as a thin sheet of plastic or metal. In this embodiment the inside surface of the fire-rated luminaire cover (the side facing the floor when installed) is coated with a highly reflective coating often used on modern ceiling tile or coated with a thin plastic or metal coating to increase reflectivity as well as durability. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSIONS, RAMIFICATIONS, AND SCOPE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it can be seen that the invention provides a dramatic reduction in the cost to manufacture, ship and store luminaires. In addition, substantial savings in the cost of installation are achieved since the luminaires can easily be assembled, installed and connected to the power source by non-skilled, non-electrician installers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. Various other embodiments and ramifications are possible within it&apos;s scope. For example, although the specification describes the nestable and flattenable luminaire with a ballasted-socket designed for a class II or class III high-frequency power input, the nestable luminaire concept can also be used with non-class II or III, AC and DC circuits. The ballasted-socket in these situations would merely have to enclose all non-class II and III circuits and wiring, while the input connection would have to meet the local codes that may apply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The specification shows and describes the ballasted-socket being mounted through an aperture from the rear of the luminaire. This technique generally allows the lamp to be mounted more closely to the top plane of the luminaire, but the ballasted-socket can be designed to be mounted within and from the front of the luminaire as well. The specification also discusses the field assembly of the nestable luminaire and how the ballasted-socket is clipped into the luminaire&apos;s reflector, much of the reduction of the in shipping volume can still be achieved with the ballasted socket already mounted in the reflector prior to shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> While the specification discusses the use of plastic for the reflector material, under certain circumstances it will be advantageous to use other materials, such as metal, fiberglass, etc. The figures show the shape of the reflector to be a truncated pyramid, but any structural shape that will function as a reflector and allow one reflector to be nested within another for shipping purposes is suitable for this purpose. The optics may be improved by making the sides curved instead of flat and by using different angles for the slopes of the sides. The specification is presented in terms of 2&prime;X2&prime; and 2&prime;X4&prime; luminaires. While these luminaires are currently the most common, the invention works equally well for other sizes as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The various types of lamps require different ballasted-sockets, which in turn require different mounting apertures. In an effort to minimize the number of different reflectors that are needed to accommodate the various lamp types, the same reflector can be manufactured with the material of the reflector made thinner at the outline of the various apertures. In this way, the same reflector can be used for several different lamp types by merely knocking out the material of the appropriate aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The fire-rated luminaire cover is described in the above specification using the 2D lamp as an example, the invention clearly is applicable to luminaires that use other single-ended lamps, linear lamps, U-lamps, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given. </paragraph>
