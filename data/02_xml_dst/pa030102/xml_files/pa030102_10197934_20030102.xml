<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to systems and methods for producing and using fine particle materials. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for taking raw materials, pulverizing those raw materials, and incorporating the pulverized materials into products to enhance the visual appearance of the products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In numerous commercial products, pigment blends are used to create color and visual effects that aesthetically appeal to consumers. Because different consumers have different preferences to various visual effects, a designer&apos;s ability to create and control these effects is often important to the marketability of a product. Often, additives such as coated mica flakes, metal flakes, and glass flakes have been used in pigment blends to enhance the visual appeal of items such as automobiles, boats, planes, appliances, signs, painted surfaces, fabrics, and other consumer goods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Depending on the nature of the substrate to which the pigment blend is introduced, there are certain visual effects that often have strong aesthetic appeal to consumers. Coated mica flakes, for example, is one of the more common additives used to improve luster and depth of color of paint compositions on cars. Metal flakes, such as aluminum flakes, are another common additive used to improve the sparkle of paint and coatings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While the aforementioned additives offer some of the visual effects that typically appeal to consumers, a need remains for an economical pigment blend that enables a designer to create and control a broader range of visual effects. Moreover, a need always exists for improved ways to enhance the functional properties of paint and coating compositions, such as increased durability, increased travel, improved pattern control, UV screening, and reduced settling problems from particulates in unapplied paint or coatings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These and other needs are satisfied in accordance with the present invention by providing systems and methods for making and using fine particle materials in pigment blends and for using the aforementioned pigment blends in paint, coating, or coloring compositions. The invention further provides systems and methods for enhancing the visual appearance of a variety of substrates by introducing such a paint, coating, or coloring composition to the substrate. The fine particle materials of the present invention have a substantially random geometric shape, a particle size less than about 100 microns, and help provide both functional and visual enhancing properties to compositions and substrates containing these fine particle materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The fine particle materials of the present invention may be made generally from any pulverizable material. Initially, solid raw pulverizable material may be sorted according to type and subsequently cleaned of any impurities. Depending on the original size of the solid raw material, it may be sent, either before or after cleaning, to a crusher to reduce the size of the raw material into pieces suitable for efficient pulverizing. Once the raw material has been separated, crushed, and cleaned, it is conveyed to a first feed hopper that then feeds the raw material to a first pulverizer. The pulverized particles made by pulverizing the raw material may then be sent to a screen classifier to remove any remaining impurities, such as particle metal waste resulting from wear and tear of the innards of the pulverizer, if necessary. Next, the pulverized particle material is classified according to size. Pulverized particle materials that do not meet the desired size limitation may be sent to be either pulverized again or milled to further reduce the particle material to a size suitable for the desired application. Alternatively, the pulverized material produced by the first pulverizer may be sent immediately to a ball mill to help reduce the particle material to a desired particle size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The fine particle materials of the present invention may be used in pigment blends to enhance the visual and functional properties of a substrate. One or more coloring agents may be optionally added to the pigment to assist with enhancing the visual appearance of the substrate to be treated. The visual appearance of the substrate may be enhanced by introducing a coating, coloring, or paint composition containing the pigment blend with the fine particle material to the substrate by either applying the composition to the surface of the substrate or by incorporating the composition into the substrate itself.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Turning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, one embodiment of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for producing fine particle materials in accordance with the present invention is shown. As illustrated, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is directed toward the production of fine particle glass. However, it should be noted that with minor modification, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could be used to produce other types of fine particle materials, including rubber, oyster shell, rock minerals, coal, aluminum, and other similar crushable materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Initially raw material glass is stored in storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may contain six storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or any suitable number of storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Within storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the raw material glass may be sorted by type. For example, the raw material glass may be separated by type and color so that clear glass, green glass, amber glass, aluminum-coated mirror, gold-coated mirror, and mixed glass are each stored in a different one of storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Most commonly the mirrors will be silver-copper coated with a paint backing. In addition to using mirrors with different types of backing, mirrors of varying thickness may also be employed. For example, other raw material products, such as one-quarter inch or one-half inch mirror may also be used. The one-quarter inch and one-half inch mirrors may be mixed together or treated separately to yield fine glass particles. Depending on the application and visual effect sought, one or more classes of mirrors may be combined to yield a combination of fine particle materials that provide sought after visual enhancing properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Using conveyer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, glass may be removed from any one or more of storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and transported to magnetic separator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Magnetic separator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be used to remove any metal waste that may be mixed in with the raw glass. Conveyer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> then carries the glass to crusher <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Crusher <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is used to crush the raw material glass down into a size suitable for further processing. The crushed glass is then conveyed to washer/dryer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In washer/dryer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the crushed glass is then removed of paper, glue, and any other impurities that may be present in the crushed glass. In an alternative embodiment, the glass may be first cleaned by washer/dryer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> before it is crushed by crusher <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as part of the cleaning process, the combustible impurities that may accompany the glass (e.g., labels from recycled glass) may be burned off of the raw glass material either before or after the glass is crushed by crusher <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Once the glass has been crushed, washed and dried, the glass is then conveyed by conveyer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to a first feed hopper <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. First feed hopper <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> then feeds the crushed and cleaned glass to a first pulverizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by way of a screw conveyer. First pulverizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> performs an initial pass on the crushed glass and provides first-stage pulverized glass through pipe <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to dust collector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Dust collector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> releases air pressure from the output of first pulverizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Attached to dust collector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a material transport system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that restabilizes the air pressure in the output of dust collector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and then drives the first-stage pulverized glass through pipe <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to screen classifier <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Once the screen classifier <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> receives the pulverized glass, it removes any remaining impurities, including any particle metal waste resulting from wear and tear of the innards of pulverizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In some cases, the screen classifier may not be needed if removal of impurities is not required. The pulverized glass output from screen classifier <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> then flows through pipe <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to first air classifier <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. First air classifier <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> then classifies the pulverized glass into three groups. The first group is the pulverized glass less than 5 microns in size. This glass is output through pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The second group is the pulverized glass between 5 and 15 microns. This glass is output through pipe <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The third group is the pulverized glass larger than 15 microns. This glass is output through pipe <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and passed to second air classifier <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Second air classifier <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> then also classifies the glass into three groups. The first group is the glass less than 5 microns in size that managed to pass through to second classifier <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. This glass is output through pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The second group is the glass that is between 15 and 30 microns in size. This glass is output through pipe <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Finally the glass that is larger than 30 microns in size is output as the third group through pipe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> back to second feed hopper <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Once the first-stage pulverized glass that is greater than 30 microns in size has been sent to second feed hopper <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the glass is then repulverized by second pulverizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> which provides second-stage pulverized glass through pipe <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to dust collector <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Dust collector <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> releases air pressure from the output of second pulverizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Attached to dust collector <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is a material transport system <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that restabilizes the air pressure in the output of dust collector <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and then drives the second-stage pulverized glass back through pipe <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to screen classifier <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. This second-stage pulverized glass then repeats the processing at air classifiers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> that was performed on the first-stage pulverized glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Finally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, the less than 5 micron pulverized glass in pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is then passed to dust collector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which releases air pressure in pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Attached to dust collector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is a material transport system <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that restabilizes the air pressure and then passes the glass to group of silos <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> via pipe <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the 5 to 15 micron glass in pipe <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is passed to group of silos <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the 15 to 30 micron glass in pipe <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is passed to group of silos <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Each of the silos in groups <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may provide a silo for a particular type of glass in one of storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, solid raw glass material is sent to feed hopper <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and pulverized by pulverizer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The first-stage pulverized particle material made by pulverizer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be further reduced in size by a ball mill <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> before it is classified according to particle size by air classifier <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Particles that need to be further reduced in size may be sent back to pulverizer <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by return pipe <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a second alternative embodiment, a ball mill may be substituted in place of second pulverizer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to help further reduce the particle size of the pulverized material. Depending on the particle size of the pulverized material, the ball mill may be a more efficient method of reducing the pulverized material to a particle size less than 30 microns. In particular, pulverized material between about 50 and 100 microns in size is well suited for use with a ball mill to obtain fine particle materials having a particle size less than about 30 microns. In contrast, pulverized materials that are greater than 100 microns may be more efficiently reduced in size by a pulverizer. </paragraph>

Also, one or more of these components may be omitted from system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and additional components may be added to system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For example, a glass tempering system could be incorporated into the flow of glass between storage bins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and groups of silos <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. By tempering the glass, added benefits can be realized in the product in which the fine particle glass is used.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An example of a pulverizer suitable for use as pulverizers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is described in Greco U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,044 (hereinafter &ldquo;the &apos;044 patent&rdquo;) issued Oct. 13, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. As explained in the &apos;044 patent, and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, solid material to be pulverized enters an inlet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to a processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within container <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is divided into four compartments by baffle plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and each compartment contains a rotor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Rotors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are fixed to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for rapid rotation within processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Each rotor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has peripheral vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that impel solid material radially outward against inside surfaces of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that are arranged around each impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably have multi-sided internal surfaces surrounding and confronting each respective impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Solid material flung radially outward by vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on rotors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> impacts against the internal surfaces of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for breaking the solid material down into finer particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the particles become smaller, they move downward through successive stages within processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The particles pass through spaces that are available between vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the inside surfaces of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The material then flows through central openings of successive baffle plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to enter lower stages where it encounters successive impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The pulverized material outlet from the lowermost stage below the lowermost impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> proceeds downward through an output chute <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The rotation of vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> pumps air through processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along with solid material, and this helps force pulverized particles through output chute <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, along with an air stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Considerable power is input to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via pulley <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, for violently hurling solid material outward against rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In a working prototype, for example, a 300 horsepower motor drives shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by a toothed belt (not shown) mating with teeth on pulley <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The power expended in processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces considerable heat. The shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> lengthens about 3 mm from the heat generated during operation. The exact lengthening of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will depend on materials used in construction, materials being processed, power input, and other variables; but however much shaft lengthening actually occurs must be accounted for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the shaft lengthening may be accommodated for by a floating bearing system. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, beginning at the bottom, shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is supported by bottom bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A pair of ball bearings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are fitted to a lower region of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between bottom collars <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and a top collar <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Ball bearings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are arranged in a housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so that outer bearing races fit within the inside of housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and inner bearing races fit on and rotate with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends between an outer race of bearing <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a cover plate <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> that is secured to housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Cover plate <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> contains a seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> bearing against shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to keep dirt out of the inside of housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Bore holes <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> form passageways to admit lubricating grease and provide pressure relief overflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A fan <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is secured to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> above bearing housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to direct cooling air flow over housing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and cover plate <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, for removing heat from ball bearings <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> during operation. Above fan <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pulley <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is preferably keyed to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for transmitting driving torque from a motor-driven belt (not shown). Shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has support bearings both above and below pulley <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Above pulley <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and below discharge chute <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a bearing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A fixed support plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> holds a bearing mount housing <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a fixed position surrounding shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Within housing <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is a ball bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having an inner race <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> fitted on and movable with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and an outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> that has a sliding fit allowing vertical movement within mount <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. A seal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is arranged between housing <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and another seal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is arranged between cover plate <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Seals <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> help keep dirt from entering mount <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves a small amount vertically from thermal expansion and contraction; and inner bearing race <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, while rotating with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, also moves axially with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> during thermal elongation. Outer bearing race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> has a sliding fit within housing <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> that allows vertical movement of outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, even at elevated temperatures. An array of compression springs <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> arranged within mount <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> presses downward on outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to resist upward movement and prevent rotation of outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Six compression springs equally spaced apart in a ring around shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are adequate for this purpose, and other spring arrangements can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> elongates from thermal expansion and ball bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> rises with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> compresses springs <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and rises along with inner race <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to keep ball bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in working alignment. When shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> later cools and contracts, lowering ball bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, springs <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extend somewhat and push outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> downward in alignment with inner race <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. A reasonably light pressure from springs <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is adequate to prevent outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> from rotating and keep outer race <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in vertical alignment with inner race <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A fan <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> fixed to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> below bearing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> directs cooling air over bearing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to remove heat from ball bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Fan <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> works in an opposite direction from fan <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> that supports bearing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also supports a pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that extends upward around shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into discharge passageway <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At the top of pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is a bearing assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> holding another ball bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> for supporting shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A lower shaft seal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is arranged between a mount housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and an upper shaft seal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is arranged between a mount cover plate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. An array of compression springs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> retained in cover plate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> presses down against an outer race <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of ball bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. As previously described for bearing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, springs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allow outer bearing race <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to rise with inner bearing race <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> when shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> elongates thermally. This is possible because outer race <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a sliding fit within mount housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> against the resistance of springs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and bearing mount <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> within discharge passageway <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> subjects bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to the risk of pulverized material in chute <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> entering housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. To reduce this risk, plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is fixed on shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> above cover plate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for mount <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> spins with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and thereby throws pulverized material radially outward to divert such material away from bearing housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. This helps keep ball bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> clean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, being fixed to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, rises with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when thermal elongation occurs. Rising of plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> opens a gap between the underside of plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and the top of housing cover <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. To inhibit entry of pulverized material into such a gap, plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> has a ring <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> extending downward into a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> formed in cover plate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Ring <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are concentric with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that ring <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> spins within groove <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and provides a material barrier across a gap between cover plate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the underside of plate <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. These measures, in conjunction with shaft seals <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, assure that bearing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> remains clean. Many different configurations of rings and grooves can be used for such a purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An upper bearing assembly <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is arranged on a support plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> above processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at an upper region of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Mount housing <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of assembly <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> contains a pair of ball bearings <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, each having a sliding vertical fit within housing <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. An array of compression springs <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> presses downward on the outer race of bearing <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> so that both bearings <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can rise with thermal elongation of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> against the pressure of springs <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Shaft seals <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are arranged respectively in mount housing <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and in housing cover plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. A fan <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> arranged above cover plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> directs cooling air over housing <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for cooling bearings <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The bearing assemblies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, arranged above fixed lower bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, all have housing and spring arrangements that allow outer bearing races to rise with thermal elongation of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This ensures that all bearings run in alignment and give proper support to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> under operating conditions. Without such provisions for axial movement of bearings with shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, bearings are destroyed as heat is generated from the work done in processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Many different spring arrangements and configurations of bearings and mount housings are possible, providing the bearings are given freedom of vertical movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Within processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the throughflow of material being pulverized has been improved and the aggressiveness of the pulverizing action has been enhanced by several improvements. At an upper region of processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is arranged a ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that has a multi-sided inside surface <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that is beveled to face downward toward uppermost impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Downwardly beveled faces <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are wider at corners where faces meet, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and are narrower in central face regions, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> directs material downward into contact with vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on uppermost impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that any material bouncing upward into contact with ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is deflected back downward to encounter pulverizing force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that surround impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are also improved, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have different numbers of inward facing surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and these are preferably inclined inward from bottom to top, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A 10 degree inclination for ring surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferred, but other angles of inclination may also work. The inward slope of surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> makes their upper regions extend further into processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> than their lower regions, which tends to deflect material downward into impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The inward inclination of surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of a succession of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> enhances the throughflow of material being pulverized and also helps direct pulverizable material into contact with vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Inward facing surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are also preferably provided with ridges and grooves, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Preferably evenly spaced ridges <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> separated by grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provide a jagged or zigzag contour for surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for scattering material impacting on surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Sloping sides <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of ridges <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> deflect impacting material in various directions, depending on angle of incidence. Sloping ridge sides <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can also lead to double impacts of material glancing off of one ridge side and impacting against another. The result is to deflect or rebound material in different directions, adding randomness to the pulverizing process and making pulverization more aggressive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the present invention, modifications to the pulverizer described in the &apos;044 patent and herein in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be implemented as part of pulverizers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. For example, rather than using a shaft that is mounted on floating bearings (as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the present invention may also be implemented with a shaft that has a coupling between portions of the shaft between one or more stationary bearings or that is cooled to prevent expansion. More particularly for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the pulverizer of the &apos;044 patent and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be split into two or more portions and connected by a torque transferring coupling <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, coupling <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a spline shaft that connects the two halves of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and coupling <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a compressible coupling that connects the two halves of shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, however, any suitable type of coupling <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> could be used. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the pulverizer of the &apos;044 patent and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> could additionally or alternatively be cooled to prevent expansion. The approach shown uses a cooling liquid <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> that is pumped through shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to keep it from expanding. Cooling liquid <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may be stored in a reservoir <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, then pumped by a pump <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> through a rotary coupler <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> into rotating shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> back out another rotary coupler <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> into a radiator or heat exchanger <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and back into reservoir <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Other examples of modifications that could be made to the pulverizer of the &apos;044 patent and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the pulverizer could include a threaded section <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and a pair of nuts <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> that enable a user to adjust the gaps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> between vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and baffles plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Gaps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are adjusted by turning nut <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> to adjust the height of impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> resting thereon. Once the height is set, nut <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is made snug against nut <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> to lock in the setting. Because the remaining impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> rest on the bottom impeller (and thus axially slide on shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while remaining rotationally fixed with respect to shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), adjusting nut <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> causes all of the gaps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> to be adjusted. By properly tuning gaps <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the pulverizer can be made to operate most efficiently. The preferred gap spacing is about 0.062 inches for waste glass, although other gap spacings may be used with glass or other types of materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, still another modification to the pulverizer of the &apos;044 patent and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is shown. As can be seen, this modification includes incorporating additional vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> along the bottom of one or more of impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Preferably, vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are only used on the bottom of the lowest impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the pulverizer and vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are smaller than vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> provide a restriction on the flow of the material being passed out of the pulverizer. This restriction then causes the material to become further pulverized. Preferably, fifteen vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and three vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are used on the bottom impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, fifteen vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and no vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are used on the middle impellers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and eighteen vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and no vanes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are used on the top impeller <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, preferably, the spacing <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> between the vanes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and plates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are tuned identically to about 0.062 inches (e.g., using the mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), although any suitable spacing or combination of spacings could alternatively be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> are a variation of rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the pulverizer. Rather than being constructed with an inside radius that decreases from bottom to top (as can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), rings <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> decrease in radius symmetrically from the middle height of the rings toward both the bottom and the top of the rings. In this way, the rings can be flipped over during maintenance of the pulverizer in order to compensate for the wear that typically occurs at near the inside-top of the rings without rebuilding or replacing the rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, fine particle materials, such as those produced using system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C, may be used to provide pigment blends containing randomly geometrically shaped particles suitable for use with one or more coloring agents such as pigments, metal flakes, coated mica, holographic flakes, colored or coated microbeads, colored or coated glass chips and other similar coloring agents. Alternatively, the coloring agents may be present in a colored base coating or substrate over which a transparent paint or coating composition containing the pigment blends of this invention can be applied. Most preferably, the fine particle chips are made of glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> While the pigment blend may contain coated fine glass particle chips that have an opaque, mirrorized, and/or reflectorized coating, the glass chip mixture preferably includes glass chips that are transparent to allow light transmission. The transparent glass chips may include colorless and/or colored glass chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> If the fine glass particle chips are colored, they may be used either alone or in combination with other colored glass chips to provide coloration to the pigment blend. The colored glass chips may have the same color as the coloring agents included in the pigment blend to enrich and deepen the apparent color of the other included coloring agents. Alternatively, the fine colored glass particles may have a different color to create secondary colors when viewed in combination with one or more coloring agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Because the fine colored glass particles may themselves act as a coloring agent, they may be used to replace pigments that are traditionally added to pigment blends. Because the color in colored glass are fused into the glass, colored glass chips may be a good coloring agent because the color will not leach out with time or exposure to various external elements such as high temperature and weather. Different colored glass chips may be mixed together to form secondary colors when the colored glass chips are viewed in combination. Secondary colors created by mixing two different colored glasses may also be subsequently mixed with primary colors available in other types of colored glass and/or other coloring agents to create apparent tertiary colors. Other color combinations necessary to achieve the desired color through the use of colored glass and/or other coloring agents will be evident to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The fine glass particle materials may be formed from virgin or recycled glass. Recycled glass is preferred because of its very low cost and because it helps preserve the environment by conserving natural resources and by reducing the amount of waste that must ultimately be stored in landfills. Recycled glass may be readily obtained from a variety of sources, such as a local recycling center, and may include clear glass (e.g., from jars), green glass (e.g., from certain beer bottles), amber glass (e.g., from certain soda bottles and other beer bottles), and mirrored glass (e.g., from recycled automobiles, home and office construction waste, and architectural glass). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Because recycled glass often already contains additives such as coloration or coatings that make the material colored, opaque, reflective, mirrorized, etc., the cost to produce useful pigment blends from recycled glass is even more inexpensive than attempting to use virgin glass to which coloration and/or coating must often be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The fine particle chips preferably are under 100 &mgr;m in the largest dimension. Because paint and coatings on substrates commonly are less than about 70 &mgr;m thick, the largest dimension of the chips must typically be less than 70 &mgr;m so that the paint or coating containing the chips appears and feels smooth on the substrate. However, because individual layers of the paint or coating on a substrate may be as thin as 20-30 &mgr;m, the chips preferably are smaller than 30 &mgr;m in the largest dimension. Particle sizes larger than 30 &mgr;m may be tolerated, however, if the particle lies flat in the paint or coating composition such that the particle height extends not more than a few microns above the surface of the paint or coating on the substrate. Plastics, such as injection molded plastics and the like, may have surfaces that are rougher in texture, and consequently may include glass chips with larger particle size for visual and functional enhancing purposes without degrading or detracting from the apparent smoothness of the article. Preferably, the chips should be no larger than 40 &mgr;m in those circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> To ensure the paint or coating containing the fine particle chips appears and feels smooth on a substrate while preserving the enhanced visual effects that the chips provide, at least 95% of the chips most preferably are between 5 to 15 &mgr;m in the largest dimension. The chips will typically contain a distribution of particle sizes. The leading edge of the curve most preferably should not exceed 30 &mgr;m. The particle size may be determined by a Malvern MasterSizer 2000, or any other suitable particle size characterizer known to those skilled in the art. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> illustrates a particle size distribution <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> of particles made in accordance with the present invention and which are suitable for use in the pigment blend of the present invention. FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D show scanning-electron-microscope micrographs <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> of mirrorized glass chips produced in accordance with the present invention. FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D illustrate the randomly geometric shapes suitable for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Although the chips may be formed in using system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it should be noted that the glass chips may also be formed by any other method, provided that method produces random shaped particles having the aforementioned characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The glass chips may be made from any variety of glass compositions including silica glass, quartz, soda lime glass, electroconductive glass, sol-gel glass, organically modified sol-gel glass etc. The glass is preferably inorganic, inert, and does not react with other components of the pigment blend. Although the glass chips may be non-tempered, they preferably are tempered to provide greater durability. Because tempered glass chips are tougher, they are more durable and are better able to preserve their geometric shape, which is important to obtaining enhanced visual effects from the glass chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The transparent glass chips preferably have an index of refraction between 1.5 to 2.5, more preferably between 1.9 to 2.1, or mixtures thereof. The transparent glass chips preferably transmit light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum (between 200 to 400 nm), visible spectrum (between 400 to 800 nm), infrared (IR) spectrum (between 800 nm to 10 &mgr;m), or combinations thereof. More preferably, the transparent glass chips transmit visible and IR light while inhibiting UV transmission. By limiting UV transmission, the chips can reduce the damaging effect that UV light may have on paint, a coating, and/or a substrate beneath the glass chips. Most preferably, the transparent glass chips transmits only visible light. For specific applications, the glass chips may also selectively transmit and/or inhibit one or more wavelengths in one or more of the aforementioned spectral regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The reflective fine particle chips may be optically opaque, mirrorized, or reflectorized, such that the reflective chips reflect or emit light from the surface of the chips into and through the transparent glass chips present, or against coloring agents. These reflective chips in combination with one or more coloring agents give added depth and intensity to the visual appearance and color of the composition or substrate containing the pigment blend of this invention. The pigment blends containing the reflectorized chips may contain suitable additives, known to those skilled in the art, to create a variety of colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the reflective chips may be luminescent, electroluminescent, or phosphorescent. Each of those properties may be obtained by coating the chips with conventional luminescent, electroluminescent, or phosphorescent compositions known to those skilled in the art. Where necessary, the coating may also be electroconductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The pigment blends containing the glass chips are suitable for use with multi-layer paint systems, such as those used on automobiles. Automobile paint systems typically comprise a base color coating having a 20 to 24 micron thick film build and a 42 to 48 micron thick clear coat. Until now, pigment blends of the present invention could not be produced on a commercial scale and used without the difficulties of film protrusion or other undesirable appearance factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, pigment blends containing the glass chips may be used in a mono-layer coating (non-clear coat) for exterior and interior paint applications. The pigment blends of this invention add a very satiny appearance to the surface while also creating a scattered reflective and luminescent appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, particulate solids, such as oyster shells, clam shells, rubber, rock minerals, coal, aluminum, etc., that have randomly geometric shapes and sizes, may also be used for visual enhancement purposes in pigment blends in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The presence of particulate solids in pigment blends offers the added advantage of reducing the amount of volatile organic compounds that commonly are used in paint and coating compositions. In alternative embodiments, lighter density particles may be used to reduce settling problems that can arise with heavier density particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Paint or coating compositions containing pigment blends of the present invention may be applied by any suitable method known to those skilled in the art, including calendering, spraying, brush painting, or any other standard method of applying paint or coating compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The pigment blends of the present invention may be used on a variety of substrates, including metal, ceramic, glass, asbestos, human skin, leather, vinyl, plastic, polyester, epoxies, fabrics, wood, rubber, etc., for visual and functional enhancement. For example, a clear coating for wood may be enhanced with a pigment blend containing colorless glass chips and/or colored glass chips. The glass chips can increase the visual dimensionality of the wood by enhancing the tone and expanding the apparent definition of the ticking or grain in the wood, while also providing functional enhancement such as improved color travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In addition, substrates containing the pigment blend of the present invention can show improved abrasion resistance, which may be particularly useful in items such as articles of clothing, including leather goods. Substrates containing pigment blends with the fine particle can also show improved light fastness if the chips contain suitable UV screening. The fine particle chips may also be used as a component of a pigment blend in cosmetics to provide enhanced visual and functional properties. For example, cosmetics containing the fine particle materials may be used to help provide UV screening for the skin, camouflage blemishes, cellulite, wrinkles, varicose veins or other skin imperfections, and enhance the visual effect of the coloring agents contained within the pigment blend of the cosmetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Surface visibility of articles may be improved with pigment blends containing mirrorized and/or reflectorized fine particle chips. In particular, pigment blends containing mirrorized glass chips provide superior reflectivity and visibility compared to blends containing metal flakes. Such pigment blends can improve safety while also providing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Because mirrorized or reflectorized glass chips display scattered reflectivity, enhanced night and day time surface visibility can be achieved from both multiangle light sources and light sources close to the viewing angle of an observer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the foregoing is only illustrative of the principles of the invention, and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
