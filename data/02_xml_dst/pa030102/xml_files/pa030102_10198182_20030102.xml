<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to: a C-seal for use in a pump; a vertical centrifugal pump with oil lubrication; a pump with threaded shaft position adjustment capability; and/or a pump including an anti-vibration wedge disposed between the bearing frame and bearing housing. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Centrifugal chemical processing pumps are old and well-known in the art. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,396, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Such pumps often utilize O-rings for certain sealing functions. Unfortunately, such O-rings are often designed so as to be temperature sensitive, and prone to failure at very high temperatures. Thus, there exists a need in the art for a seal for use in any type of pump that is capable of withstanding high temperatures and/or corrosive materials or conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Horizontally oriented pumps (e.g. see the &apos;396 patent) typically utilize oil as a lubricant. However, known vertically oriented pumps often use grease as a lubricant instead of oil due to the vertical orientation and cost effectiveness. Grease is not as desirable as oil for lubrication purposes. Thus, there exists a need in the art for a vertical pump capable of using oil as a lubricant instead of grease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Pump seal assemblies or dry ends are often designed so as to mechanically fit with only wet ends made by the manufacturer of the pump. Thus, there exists a need in the art for a pump capable of being easily adjustable so as to be capable of fitting different sized wet ends from a variety of manufacturers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a purpose of this invention to fulfill any or all of the above-described needs in the art, as well as other needs which will become apparent to the skilled artisan from the following detailed description of this invention. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THIS INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now more particularly to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals indicate like parts throughout the several views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side partial cross-sectional view of one-half of a portion of a centrifugal pump according to an embodiment of this invention (the half of the annular components on the other side of the pump shaft are not shown). The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> embodiment includes C-shaped annular seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as well as first and second coaxial annular sleeves <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a flexible approximately C-shaped annular sealing member including first and second flexible approximately parallel legs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are interconnected by a base of the C-shaped sealing member. Annular spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided between legs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in order to bias the two legs <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> outwardly away from one another so that each leg forms a sealing interface with a surface of an adjacent member (i.e. the springs functions to spread the legs into sealing positions). Thus, leg <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is biased by spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> radially inward toward shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> into sealing contact with a radially outer surface of approximately Z-shaped annular stator ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, while the other leg <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of C-seal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is biased by spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a radially outward direction and into sealing contact with a radially inner surface of annular flush ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be a metallic (e.g. stainless steel) helical wound spring in certain embodiments. In other embodiments, spring <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be a cantilever spring, an etched spring, or a coil spring. In certain embodiments, the flexible body of the main body of seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> including the legs may be made of a polymer (-e.g. PBI). An exemplary C-seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be obtained from EGC Corp., Houston Tex., Model 20A. Each of the aforesaid elements of seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as well as members <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is annular and thus wraps around rotatable pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While C-shaped seal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> embodiment in between flush ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and stator ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, such an annular approximately C-shaped seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may also be positioned in any other location in either a horizontally or vertically oriented centrifugal pump where radially inwardly and outwardly biasing sealing forces are required. Thus, many O-rings in conventional pumps may be replaced with C-shaped seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be exposed to much higher temperatures (e.g. up to 800 degrees F. in certain embodiments) than conventional O-rings, without failing. Seal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also anti-corrosive in nature due to its design and polymer base. It is noted that seal assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not rotate with shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the section of the pump in which the majority of the seal flushing system and seal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are located. The remainder (e.g. shaft, motor, impeller, etc.) of the centrifugal pump according to this embodiment, exclusive of what is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,299, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The centrifugal pump according to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> embodiment includes (or further includes) rotatable pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (illustrated non-cross-sectionally) adapted to be driven by the pump motor, stationary pump stuffing box <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, inner sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> affixed to shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith, outer sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> surrounding and coaxial with the inner sleeve, gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which remains stationary while shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates, removable flush ring insert <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a seal made up of annular rotating sealing member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which rotates along with shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and stationary annular sealing member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a plurality of radially spaced biasing springs <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a plurality (e.g. five to ten) of radially spaced pins <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for actuating annular seal assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> including annular metal rings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which surround flexible graphite inclusive annular sealing ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a plurality of radially extending set screws <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, snap ring <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, snap ring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, flush port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and mounting bolts with corresponding nuts (not shown) for attaching the flush/seal gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to stuffing box <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and thus to the pump. Springs <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> bias or push support/antirotation ring <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which in turn allows shrunk-fit Z-shaped metallic member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be biased or pushed thereby causing stationary carbon sealing member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to be biased into fluid sealing interface with rotating sealing member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. With regard to the seal, annular rotating sealing member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> rotates along with shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Its companion, annular stationary sealing member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, remains stationary along with gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and sealing assembly <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during pump operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Annular gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extends radially outward from sleeves <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and thereby surrounds pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on all sides. A single flush port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is defined in gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for the purpose of allowing the flush liquid to flow toward annular flush chamber <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Annular flush chamber <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> surrounds the exterior periphery of each of rotating sealing member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, stationary sealing member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and their fluid sealing interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In fluid communication with flush port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is passageway <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (defined in gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) and annular flow chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> surrounds pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and is located between the inner periphery of a portion of gland <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the exterior periphery of a portion of flush ring insert <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Pressurized flushing liquid flowing through port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and passageway <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> flows into chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and flows through this chamber around shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. From annular flow chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the flushing liquid proceeds through a plurality of radially spaced flush apertures or holes (not shown) defined in flush ring insert <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and into annular flush chamber <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> so as to flush the sealing interface between members <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By providing a plurality of radially spaced flush apertures around the circumference of shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the sealing interface, the resulting flush flow into chamber <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is akin to a shower-head effect in that the seal interface between <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is flushed at a plurality of different locations along its periphery with substantially the same force at each place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After the liquid (e.g. either water or the liquid being pumped) in chamber <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> flushes (i.e. cleans and/or cools) the sealing interface, sealing member <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and sealing member <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the liquid flows axially along shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through annular exit passageway <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments of this invention, ring insert <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not include any flushing apertures therein (i.e. it is a solid annular member). In such embodiments, fluid from port <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> flows into annular chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and then flows therethrough around the radially outer periphery of member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in order to perform a cooling function. A separate output port (not shown) may be provided in such embodiments for allowing the cooling fluid to exit cooling chamber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The cartridge seal of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also allows for the use of an optional vapor shield and throttle bushing. A steam quench and drain may be used to purge coked material from the outboard side of the primary seal faces. The throttle bushing may be used to restrict leakage to atmosphere in the event of a catastrophic seal failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Seal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> functions as follows. Flexible graphite inclusive sealing member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not self energizing, and thus must be energized mechanically by pressing on it and/or squeezing it. Inner sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is affixed to shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith, as is outer seal energizing sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Energizing sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is preferably thinner than inner sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and is located radially outward of at least a portion of main sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. By locating energizing sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> radially outward of sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has adequate clearance to operate properly and allows a full length of main seal sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to assure proper centering of the rotating seal components described above relative to the stationary seal components. One end of outer annular sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is held in place by annular support <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and the other end of sleeve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> presses or forces a plurality of radially spaced pins <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which in turn cause flexible annular sealing member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be compressed between metal rings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be rectangular in cross section, while ring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be triangular in cross section in certain embodiments. When sealing member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is compressed between rings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the radially inner and outer peripheries of member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are squeezed or forced radially inwardly and outwardly, respectively, into sealing interfaces with shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the inner surface at <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> of a step portion of the inner sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Seal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> thus seals fluid against movement along shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thereby sealing the inner sleeve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> design in this regard also allows for a larger size of graphite sealing member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> than otherwise is possible in conventional seal systems. In certain embodiments, flexible sealing member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (as well as flexible sealing members <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>) may be made of a flexible graphite inclusive material such as Grafoil, available from UCAR Carbon Company, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrate another embodiment of this invention relating to a vertical centrifugal pump capable of being lubricated by oil or some other liquid. The pump of the FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> embodiment includes rotatable pump shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, oil chamber or sump <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> surrounding the shaft, double row bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> supporting the shaft, each bearing including ball bearings and corresponding raceways, single row bearings <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> supporting the shaft, nut <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> affixed to the shaft, bearing frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, casing mechanical seal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, oil pumping impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> affixed to shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith in oil chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and stationary impeller back cover <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Each of the aforesaid elements is annular in that each surrounds the pump shaft. The pump further includes oil filter <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, main oil recirculation system including outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, pipe <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and inlet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, oil level gauge <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and secondary oil recirculation system including approximately vertically oriented outlet <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, vertically extending passageway <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> defined in impeller back cover <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and passageway <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for allowing oil to flow into lubrication chamber <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> at an elevation above double row bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This system enables the illustrated pump to be lubricated by oil, instead of grease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Still referring to the vertical pump embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, operation of the system is described as follows. Oil or other lubricating fluid is provided in oil chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, preferably to a level just below nut <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Mechanical seal(s) <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> prevents the oil from leaking out of the sump. The pump discharges oil through two areas from reservoir <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. When the pump&apos;s motor drives shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the shaft is rotatingly supported by bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which require lubrication. Impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> rotates along with the pump shaft in chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. During rotation of oil pumping impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, pumping vanes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> cause oil in chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to be pumped radially outwardly into both main outlet passage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and secondary outlet passage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (the opening for passage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is preferably a vertically oriented hole). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This pumping effect imparted by the rotating vanes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> causes oil from the chamber to exit via main outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, pass through filter <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, and proceed vertically upwardly through pipe <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and back through oil inlet <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into a location within bearing frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at an elevation at or above uppermost bearings <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This oil then, due to gravity, drips or flows downward through and around bearings <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in order to lubricate them, and thereafter into chamber <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, and thereafter downward through and around bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in order to lubricate the same, and finally back into oil reservoir <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or sump <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, the pumping action of impeller <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and its pumping vanes <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> causes oil from chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to be pumped out through secondary outlet <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, upwardly through passageway <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that is defined in the impeller back cover <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and then upwardly through connecting passageway <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> defined in the bearing frame, from which the oil flows out into chamber <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> at an elevation above bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This oil then flows downwardly through and around bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in order to lubricate the same, and back into chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Optionally, a passageway may also be provided from passageway <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> directly to bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in order to more directly lubricate the double row bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with the FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> embodiment, the oil impeller system pumps lubricating oil from chamber <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> upwardly through first and second different passageways. One of the passageways reintroduces pumped oil at an elevation at or above both sets of bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>; while the other reintroduces pumped oil at an elevation at or above only one of the bearings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> but below the other <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This system enables the bearing structures of the pump to be properly lubricated, despite the fact that the shaft and pump itself are normally approximately vertically oriented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrate a centrifugal pump according to yet another embodiment of this invention. This pump includes heavy duty bearings designed for oil lubrication. Bearing lubrication may be accomplished by internal oil misting, internal ring oil lubricating, external sources of oil, and/or flood oil. Moreover, the device is capable of being fitted with an internal cooling device if desired. The double row thrust bearing is in an inboard position in order to give the pump shaft additional stiffness in order to reduce vibration and deflection during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the pump includes bearing frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, lubricating oil reservoir chamber <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, rotatable pump shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, oil mister assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> affixed to shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, inspection port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, oil cooler port <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, oil return/drain port <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, oil circulation ports <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, oil level sight glass <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, rigid frame adapter <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, spacer ring <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> whose thickness may be adjusted to suit different applications, conventional double axial seal <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, stuffing box <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, shaft stub <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> with center locking bolt, and forward bearing housing and shaft adjusting assembly <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Because different wet ends are of different sizes, adapter and/or spacer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to fit different wet ends. For example, in certain preferred embodiments, adapter <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> may remain the same for all wet ends, while one can change the thickness of annular spacer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in order to adjust the overall length of the product and adapt it to fit a desired wet end. Thus, many different sizes of spacers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be used depending upon the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The purpose of forward bearing housing and shaft adjusting assembly <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is to enable the seal assembly or the dry end of the pump to be adjustable in order to fit different sized wet ends. The seal housing of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be configured in a variety of ways so as to accomodate and fit with many different manufacturer&apos;s mechanical seals (or packings), and provide a variety of seal housing features such as large bore, tapered bore, slurry excluders, vanes, and the like. Moreover, the shaft is adjustable so that the power frame can be attached to most pump wet ends on the market by altering the wet end adapter pieces and/or shaft location. The frame adapter which bolts directly to the power frame is designed to be mounted to either side of the frame flange giving it added adjustability and versatility when attaching to various wet ends on the market. This seal flange is also capable of being used with a c-flange motor adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, adjusting assembly <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> includes back-to-back single row thrust bearings <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, annular bearing cover <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, annular labyrinth seal assembly <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, bearing lock nut and lock washer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, anti-vibration tapered annular locking wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, gear teeth <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> provided on the radially outer diameter of bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, twelve tooth driver gear <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, bolt <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> for allowing driver gear <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> to be driven thereby, threaded interface or connection between bearing frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and locking/unlocking screw assembly <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> for locking and unlocking wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> in position. Certain of these elements are also illustrated in an enlarged fashion in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the axial position of shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be adjustable due to the provision of the threaded connection <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> between bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and bearing frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. This threaded connection allows fine adjustability of the axial position of pump shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The axial position of shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be adjusted or changed depending upon the particular wet end desired to be interfaced with. Different sized wet ends require different pump shaft positions. The outer diameter of the flange of housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> includes integral gear teeth <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> which engage small rotatable gear <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> which is turned using a wrench on ratchet on bolt heaad <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> in order to rotate the housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> thereby enabling it to move axially due to the threads. When housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> moves axially, bearings <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and pump shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> move axially along with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> By way of example, an operator utilizing a wrench may rotate bolt <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction thereby causing gear <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> to also rotate in a clockwise direction. This rotation of gear <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> causes housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> via teeth <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> to rotate in a counterclockwise direction about the axis of the pump shaft due to the toothed connection at <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> between elements <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight>. When housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> rotates counterclockwise relative to bearing frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, the bearing frame remains stationary while housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> backs out of the frame (i.e. housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> moves to the right as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> relative to frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>). This causes shaft <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to move to the right relative to stationary frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Annular anti-vibration wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is wedged between an inner radial surface of bearing frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and an outer radial surface of bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The cross-section of annular wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> may be approximately conical frustrum in shape in certain embodiments, but may be approximately triangular in other embodiments. Wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> may be wedged into place using bolt or screw assembly <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. For example, in certain embodiments, in order to lock wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> in place after the pump shaft is in its desired position, a plurality of the larger screws or bolts of assembly <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> are tightened until the wedge is firmly seated in the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This provides additional vibration resistance during pump operation by eliminating looseness effects of a three piece assembly (bearing/bearing housing/bearing frame) and providing a metal-to-metal interface between the bearing frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and the bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> while maintaining the axial adjustability of the rotating shaft assembly. In preferred embodiments of this invention, each of wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, frame <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, and housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are made of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, each of the plurality of assemblies <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> includes first and second axially aligned screws or bolts; one smaller and one larger, with the smaller one within the larger one. As illustrated, the smaller screw may be screwed into or through the larger screw from the rear thereof, while the larger screw is threadedly attached to the bearing housing <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The distal end of the smaller screw threadedly engages wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> in order to prevent rotation of the wedge during pump operation. Thus, wedge <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> may be loosened or removed by loosening the largest screws until the large screw head pushes against the underside of the smaller screw&apos;s head. Loosening may be continued alternately between the small screw and the large screw of each assembly until the wedge becomes unseated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Once given the above disclosure, therefore, various other modifications, features, or improvements will become apparent to the skilled artisan. Such other features, modifications, and improvements are thus considered a part of this invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims. </paragraph>
