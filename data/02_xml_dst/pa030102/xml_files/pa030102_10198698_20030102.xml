<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The most typical type of nailing or fastening device used to drive a fastener into a workpiece is that of the &ldquo;single stroke&rdquo; type. In these types of devices, a driver assembly is driven to fasten a fastener into a workpiece with a single blow or impact. A disadvantage of these devices is that they require very high levels of impact energy, especially when longer fastener lengths are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have been some attempts to provide a &ldquo;multi-stroke&rdquo; fastening device, which employs a striker assembly, which is driven to provide a plurality of blows or impacts upon the fastener head for progressively fastening the fastener into a workpiece. Such devices have been proposed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,767,485; 2,796,608; 3,203,610; 4,183,453; 4,724,992; and 4,807,793. The disadvantage with these proposed devices is that the fastener striker assembly is driven through a plurality of driving strokes, the lengths of the strokes are progressively increased as the fastener is progressively driven into the workpiece. As a result, the timing for driving the striker assembly becomes more difficult to manage. In addition, because the stroke length of the striker assembly increases during the course of each fastening cycle, the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the tool is somewhat irregular. Therefore, there is a need for a multi-stroke fastening device having a uniform stroke length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior art fastening devices that drive a fastener into a workpiece with a single blow need not be concerned with the fastener driver maintaining a coupled relation with respect to the fastener being driven. Multi-blow fastening devices, on the other hand are presented with a unique problem in that if a plurality of fastening impacts are to be imparted upon a single fastener to drive the fastener into the workpiece, the tool tends to bounce off the fastener head with each drive stroke. This may lead to an inefficient and rather clumsy operation of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typical multiple blow fastening devices are pneumatically operated, therefore there has been little concern to conserve power. A battery operated fastening device is a lot more mobile and requires less equipment and assembly to operate than pneumatically operated devices. Therefore, there is a need for a fastening device that is battery operated and is constructed and arranged to conserve power during a fastening operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Power fastening devices for driving nails into a workpiece come in a variety of types. The fasteners used in such fastening devices vary according to the application. Most fasteners are made from a steel material. It is known in the art that the diameter of the fastener shank has a bearing on the strength of the connection provided. Basically, the greater the shank diameter, the greater the securing function provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For certain applications, such as in, pneumatically operated framing nailers, it has been known that the framing nails can be coated with a thermoplastic material that partially liquifies while the nails are being driven and then acts as an adhesive when the thermoplastic again solidifies after the nails are driven into the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The adhesive nature of the thermoplastic is advantageous for certain applications because it increases the strength of the connection without requiring enlargement of the metal shank diameter. An ancillary benefit to providing the thermoplastic coating is that it reduces the energy required to drive the nail into the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of providing a thermoplastic coating onto fastening nails is that it significantly increases the cost of manufacture in comparison with the same nails that are not so coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Roofing nails, which typically have a shank diameter of about 0.120&Prime;&plusmn;0.0015&Prime; and a head diameter of about 0.350&Prime;-0.438&Prime;, are typically used to fastener shingles onto a roof. Heretofore, roofing nails have not been coated because the shank and head dimensions are sufficiently large to provide a relatively strong connection, particularly in light of the typically relatively soft shingle material that often tears before the nails would be pulled out. The cost of coating roofing nails has been considered to far outweigh any benefit to be gained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Through experimentation with the unique fastening device described herein, applicants have recognized that in the particular application of a battery operated roofing fastener assembly, conservation of energy (i.e., battery life) is critical. Therefore, although roofing nails provide a more than adequate securement of shingles without the need for coating the same, and although thermoplastic coating significantly adds to the cost of manufacture, applicants have determined that the amount of increase in battery life results from providing coated roofing nails warrants the added cost for this particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to remove jams and repair fastening devices, it is necessary to remove the nose assembly of the fastener assembly. Typically, the nose assembly is fastened to the housing and requires tools to disassemble, thus increasing downtime. Therefore, there is a need for a fastening device which facilitates quick and easy removal of the nose assembly to remove jams, thus reducing downtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Because the fasteners of fastening devices are typically collated by a flexible collation material, the leading fastener tends to pivot about the collation material, as the fastener is driven into the workpiece, until the collation fractures. Substantial movement can disorient the fastener in the drive track. This may cause the fastener to be deformed and/or driven into the workpiece incorrectly. Therefore, there is a need to adjust the orientation of the fastener while the fastener is being driven into the workpiece. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-stroke fastening device for driving fasteners into a workpiece. This multi-stroke fastening device provides a housing, a fastener drive track carried by the housing, a striker assembly guide track mounted within the housing, a striker assembly mounted in slidable relation within said guide track, a power drive assembly, and a feed mechanism. The striker assembly includes a driver member constructed and arranged to strike a fastener disposed in the fastener drive track. The striker assembly is constructed and arranged to be moved along the guide track through a plurality of alternating drive strokes and return strokes to effect a plurality of impacts of the driver member upon the fastener in order to drive the fastener into the workpiece. The striker assembly has a substantially constant drive stroke length relative to the guide track. The power drive assembly is constructed and arranged to drive the striker assembly to effect the plurality of impacts of the driver member upon the fastener, and the feed mechanism is constructed and arranged to feed successive fasteners into the drive track to be struck by the striker assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the invention to provide a multi-stroke fastening device which includes a striker assembly having a drive stroke length which does not progressively increase as the fastener is progressively driven into the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a multi-stroke fastening device for driving fasteners into a workpiece, comprising a housing, a striker assembly guide track mounted within the housing, and a striker assembly mounted in slidable relation with respect to the guide track. The striker assembly includes a driver member constructed and arranged to strike a fastener to be driven into a workpiece. The striker assembly is moveable along the guide track through a plurality of alternating drive strokes and return strokes to effect a plurality of impacts of the driver member upon the fastener. Each drive stroke has substantially the same length. A power drive assembly is constructed and arranged to drive the striker assembly through the plurality of alternating drive strokes and return strokes to effect the plurality of impacts of the driver member upon the fastener. A nose assembly is carried by the housing and defines a fastener drive track along which the driver travels during the drive strokes and return strokes. Furthermore, a fastener head engaging structure is constructed and arranged to engage a portion of the head of the fastener to be driven at least during the return stroke. A resilient structure is operatively coupled to the fastener head engaging structure. The resilient structure is constructed and arranged to permit limited longitudinal movement of the fastener head engaging structure relative to the striker assembly guide track, and dampens impact of engagement between the fastener head engaging structure and the head of the fastener to be driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of one embodiment of the present invention to provide a multi-stroke fastening device that employs a fastener impacting driver assembly that is coupled to the driving structure so that impacts of the driver assembly are very effectively damped to reduce vibrations and shock in the system.

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The fastening device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has an outer clam-shell housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, preferably made from a rigid plastic material. A fastener drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is carried by the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the particular embodiment shown, the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided by a movable nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which has a lower longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for receiving fasteners to be positioned in the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is movable axially into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a direction along the fastener driving axis. More particularly, a nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fixed within the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> towards the forward end of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with a grooved track that receives projecting flanges integrally formed on opposite sides of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> slidably receives the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the nose assembly being biased outwardly of the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a rearward end bearing against a mounting plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> fixed within the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a forward end bearing against the rearward end of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thus biasing the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forwardly towards a forward stop position thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A striker assembly guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is fixed within the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the guide track is a cylindrical, metal tubular member, conventionally termed a &ldquo;cylinder.&rdquo; It is contemplated, however, that for other arrangements in accordance with the principles of the present invention, the guide track can be any structure which slidingly guides a striker assembly for impact and return strokes. The guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an annular resilient bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, preferably made from an elastomeric material such as rubber, disposed towards the forward end of the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that other elastomeric materials may be utilized to form the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted in slidable relation within the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is constructed and arranged to strike a fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is the leading fastener within a group of collated fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The collated fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comprise a plurality of fasteners fixed to one another by a substantially rigid collation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As shown, the leading fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is disposed within the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is movable axially along the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through a plurality of alternating drive strokes and return strokes to effect a plurality of impacts of the driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> upon the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for driving the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into a workpiece W. The driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends through an opening within the mounting plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and further extends through the center of coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is received at its forward end within an opening in the rearward end of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be received in the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for impacting upon the fasteners. The opening in mounting plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and/or opening in the rearward end of nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> maintains the driver member in axially aligned relation with the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and hence, lead fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further comprises a plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to which the driver is connected. The plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a substantially disc-shaped rearward end portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having a peripheral annular groove for receiving a generally annular sealing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed in slidable and sealed relation with an interior cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As will be described in greater detail later, the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a substantially constant drive stroke length relative to its guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. While the drive stroke may vary slightly, for example, as a result of slightly different resistances to the fastener being driven into a particular workpiece at progressive depths of the fastener, it should be appreciated that the drive stroke length does not progressively increase as the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is progressively driven into the workpiece W, as is the case with prior art constructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constructed and arranged to drive the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to effect a plurality of impacts of the driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> upon fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the power drive assembly includes a piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, having a generally cylindrical outer configuration, and an outer periphery having a sealing member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> disposed in slidable and sealed relation with the inner surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in similar fashion to sealing member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a crank member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> rotatable about an axis <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the crank member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is mounted to a crank mounting assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is fixed to the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An axis pin <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and mounts the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for rotational movement. A crank arm <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected at opposite ends thereof, including a first end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> pivotally connected to the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and opposite end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> pivotally connected with the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Thus, rotation of the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> causes reciprocating motion of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes a pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed on the periphery thereof and is constructed and arranged to receive a drive belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The drive belt is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which rotatably drives the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via the belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Rather than a pulley and belt arrangement, a gear train or other coupling arrangement could be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is switched on and off by a control circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which includes a trigger switch, which is activated by a manually actuated trigger <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and preferably also includes a nose switch, which is activated by a contact trip that is engaged when the nose assembly is retracted into the tool housing. The control circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected with a power supply assembly, preferably including a power source in the form of a battery <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and most preferably, a rechargeable battery. The battery <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a battery contact <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which can be removed from housing contacts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to enable the battery <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be recharged and/or replaced. It should be appreciated that other power sources may be used for powering the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, the device may be connected with line voltage, an air pressure supply where the device is pneumatically driven, combustion power, or other suitable power supplies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A feed mechanism <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is constructed and arranged to feed successive fasteners within the supply of collated fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to enable the successive fasteners to be struck by the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the feed mechanism <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is cooperable with a feed track <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, which is integrally cast with the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The feed track <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> feeds the collated fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The feed mechanism <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a movable feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is pivotable about its rearward end portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a torsion spring <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constructed and arranged to biased feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction (as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) about the rearward end portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The rearward end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> rides along a ramped surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moves relative to the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> further has a more forward portion thereof pivotably connected to the feed track <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to establish somewhat of a connecting rod type motion for the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is moved relative to the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the rearward end portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> rides along the ramp surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As a result of this connecting rod type motion, the forward end portion of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is able to feed individual fasteners into the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as will be appreciated from the more detailed description of the operation of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown at rest prior to a fastening operation. The collated fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are manually manipulated up through the feed track <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, so that the first two fasteners are moved beyond the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, which can be manually moved out of the feed track <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for initial loading purposes. As shown, the first fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is positioned in the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, with the tool at rest, the forward tip of the first fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> projects slightly forwardly of the fully extended forward end of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown. This preferred arrangement enables the user to view the tip of the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and position the tip at a very precise location. To view the leading fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> even more clearly, it is possible to manually move the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> inwardly into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the bias of coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to reveal a greater portion of the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for positioning the tip at a precise location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> After the tip of fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is placed against the workpiece W, the operator depresses trigger <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, thereby closing the trigger switch in circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to provide power from the battery <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> drives the belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which in turn causes rotation of the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> causes reciprocal movement of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through the connection of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via connecting arm <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Reciprocal movement of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> causes corresponding reciprocal movement of the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is resiliently coupled to the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via a substantially sealed airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the rearward end portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. More specifically, driving piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> forwardly towards the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> tends to reduce the distance between the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Because airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially sealed, the airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will be pressurized during the forward stroke of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This pressurization of airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> biases the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forwardly, away from the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, so as to maintain the volume of the sealed airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> within a predetermined range. Thus, it can be appreciated that the pressurization of airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> drives the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and hence the entire striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forwardly, so that the driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> impacts upon the head of the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This action can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It should be appreciated that the initial impact of the driver member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> releases the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from the collation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> While in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is shown having approximately two-thirds of its length driven into the workpiece W, it should be appreciated that this would typically be accomplished only after a plurality of impacts or blows upon the fastener head <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. At the bottom or end of each impact drive stroke, the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably impacts the resilient bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the forward end of the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated, however, that for certain individual strokes (e.g., towards the end of a fastening operation where extreme forces may be required to finish driving the last bit of the fastener into the workpiece) and/or certain applications (e.g., for particularly hard workpieces) the resistance of the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> being driven into the workpiece W may serve to stop the movement of the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> prior to the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> impacting on the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated, however, that it is preferred for the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to contact the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for every stroke for a more consistent operation of the device. In the instance in which the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> does not contact the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it would terminate its forward stroke movement just short of the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, with minimal spacing therebetween (e.g., less than 5 mm apart). Hence, it can be appreciated that the total impact drive stroke length is fairly constant for each impact stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> After each impact stroke, the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is drawn rearwardly within the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as a result of its being resiliently coupled to the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More particularly, as the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is withdrawn within the guide track <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the action of crank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a vacuum is created in the substantially sealed airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so as to draw the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rearwardly with the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This can be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, where the plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown being drawn rearwardly relative to an impacting position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the resilient coupling provided by the airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> substantially cushions the driving impact of the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> upon fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. This reduces vibration of the tool and provides for a quieter operation. In addition, after the striker assembly is pulled back by the vacuum in space <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> instantaneously reverses direction so as to commence forward movement, a pressure pulse or spike in generated in airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thus creating high levels of kinetic energy for driving the striker assembly forwardly. The airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in effect acts as an airspring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that because the vibrations of the tool are reduced, the life of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be increased, and the user experiences less fatigue from use of the tool as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The volume of the airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> remains within a predetermined range during the continuous cycling of the device, such that the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and plunger <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> remain within a predetermined range of distance therebetween. It can be appreciated that towards the end of an impact stroke, the volume of airspace is somewhat reduced after the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> bottoms out on the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The volume of airspace is then somewhat increased when the piston is pulled away from the bumper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> during the return stroke. Similarly, the volume is decreased towards the end of the return stroke as a result of the momentum in the rearward direction of striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and then the instantaneous reversal of direction of the piston into the forward direction. The volume of the airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a function of the mass of striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, speed of the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, stroke length of the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, among other things. Preferably, the airspace is connected with an overpressurization and underpressurization bleed valve (not shown). Thus, if at any time pressure within the airspace is above or below threshold levels, air will bleed into or out of the airspace to maintain the pressure therein within a predetermined range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to make the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> sufficiently lightweight so that it follows the travel of the piston <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for each stroke and does not become out of phase with movement of the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is also desirable for the striker assembly to impart as much of its energy as possible to the fastener to be driven, and experience as little rebound as possible. In such manner, a sufficiently large vacuum can be drawn in airspace <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, so that for each stroke the vacuum serves to pull the striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> rearwardly, and in phase with the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as opposed to rebound of the striker assembly adding a variable that may cause the striker assembly to be forced out of phase with the power drive assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> continue to cycle as described above until the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is eventually driven completely into the workpiece W. It should be appreciated that a plurality of impacts is required to drive the fastener into a typical workpiece W, such as wood. For example, it is contemplated that between about five to fifty impact strokes might be used to drive a fastener into a workpiece, depending on the application. It is also contemplated that the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> would be capable of driving the striker assembly at a rate of about forty to seventy cycles or impact strokes per second, depending upon the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is progressively retracted into the tool housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the bias of coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This action is largely a result of the forward manual force applied by the operator. When the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to fasten a horizontal surface, with the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> pointing downwardly (e.g., wood flooring), the weight of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also assists in movement of the nose assembly into the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the force of coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When the fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is completely embedded in the workpiece W, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches a point at which it is fully retracted within the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, when the nose assembly reaches this point, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> engages a contact trip (not shown) which trips a nose switch (that can be included as part of circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) to shut off motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and terminate cycling of the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and striker assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This feature is described in greater detail in connection with the description of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be pulled away from the workpiece W. As the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is pulled away from the workpiece W, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is permitted to extend outwardly from the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and hence, outwardly from the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under the force of coil spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is forced outwardly of the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it releases the nose contact trip that shut down motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will not enable the motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to be energized again until after the nose switch or nose contact trip is released and after the trigger <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is released and then subsequently depressed again. Alternately, a second contract trip may be provided, and this second contact trip would be activated once the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches the forwardmost position thereof. Activation of the second contact trip would reactivate the motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In this way, the trigger <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can remain depressed by the operator, and movement of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between its fully extended and fully retracted positions would be the means by which to shut off and restart motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> between fastening operations. It is desirable for the motor to shut down between fastening operations in order to conserve the power source <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, especially where that source is in the form of a battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as the rearward end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> rides up the ramp surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is retracted into the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> becomes positioned behind the third fastener <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. When the rearward end <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is permitted to ride back down the ramp surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is forced outwardly of the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> after a fastening operation, the forward end of the feed pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is fully positioned behind the third fastener <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the spring bias of torsion spring <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> acting through pawl <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> on the third fastener <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, moves the entire collation of fasteners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> upwardly so that the second fastener <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is moved through the slot <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and into the drive track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is now in position to be driven in subsequent fastening operations, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Opening <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is disposed in the upper portion of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receiving the used collation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Similarly, openings <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are provided in the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively, to similarly accommodate the spent collation (not shown). Where the collation <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made from a paper material (as opposed to plastic or metal), it may not be necessary to provide for any exit thereof, as it will be substantially disintegrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrate a second embodiment of the multi-stroke fastener device in accordance with the principles of the present invention, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Operation of the second embodiment is quite similar to that of the first embodiment, and hence, corresponding components are illustrated with the same reference numerals as in the first embodiment. The differences between the first embodiment and this second embodiment will be described with particularity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, the fastening device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> employs an array of collated fasteners <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, but preferably utilizes a more flexible collation <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to connect the fasteners to one another. The collation <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the heads of the fasteners are manipulated through a longitudinal slot in the top of clam shell housing <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As shown, a first fastener <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is disposed in the drive track <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is driven essentially in the same fashion as described with respect to fastener <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. At the completion of a fastening operation (as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), movement of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> into its retracted position within the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> causes the nose contact trip or switch to be tripped, thereby causing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to terminate operation of the motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and hence, the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is pulled away from the workpiece W (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), a feed mechanism <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is actuated (either by release of the first contact trip or by use of a second contact trip activated by movement of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to its extended position). The feed mechanism <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> comprises a ratchet wheel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the ratchet wheel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> has a plurality of radially extending prongs <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, which are resiliently biased outwardly via internal springs to project outwardly from a main wheel portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the feed mechanism. The prongs <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are constructed and arranged such that engagement thereof by a structure running circumferentially or tangentially to the periphery of wheel portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> in one direction will move the prongs <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> inwardly, while engagement thereof in an opposite direction will not, as will be appreciated more fully from the following further description. Although not shown, the ratchet wheel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is connected by a gear train to the nose assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art. When the nose assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is retracted during a fastener driving operation, the ratchet wheel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is rotated in a clockwise direction as viewed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. During this clockwise rotation, the radially extending spring biased members <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> have convex cam surfaces that are permitted to ride over the head of the next fastener <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and are forced inwardly against the internal spring bias thereof. In contrast, when the nose assembly <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is extended from the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> after a fastener driving operation, the ratchet wheel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction (relative to the FIGs. shown). With this action, concave catching surfaces of the resiliently biased projections <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> engage the head of the next fastener <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and drive the same into the drive track <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for the next fastening operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the second embodiment, the front end of the device <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be made somewhat smaller in comparison with that of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a third embodiment of a multi-blow fastening device, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of circled section B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. The device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is the same in many respects as the device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, the multi-blow fastening device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical striker assembly guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> within the cylindrical track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> connected with a driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, airspace <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, crank arm <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, crank <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, pulley <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, belt <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, motor <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, feed mechanism <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, an elastomeric bumper <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, and a battery <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, all as described above with respect to the first embodiment, and need not be repeated here. Driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> together with plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> constitute what may be termed a striker assembly or driver assembly <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a forward position of which is shown in phantom lines and a rearward position of which is shown in partial cross section. The piston <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is shown in its rearward position only. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other specific details of the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (such as with respect to an exit for the spent collation) may also be applied to the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and not be repeated here. The device of <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> differs from the first embodiment most significantly towards the front end of the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that interfaces with the fasteners to be driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a nose assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> mounted in the housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> preferably includes a channel-like nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> which is spring biased forwardly by a coil spring member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> receives collated fasteners <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> through a lower slot <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> in the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the nose assembly defines a drive track along which the forward end of driver <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> travels during the drive strokes and return strokes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is mounted for longitudinal, axial sliding movement within a nose receiving channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. More specifically, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, which is a sectional view taken through the line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the nose receiving channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> is provided with a pair of nose guide members <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extending laterally inwardly openings <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> through the housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and threadedly received in threaded bores in the side wall of the channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. The forward ends of guide members <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> are received in respective grooves or channels <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> formed in opposite sides of the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The engagement of guide members <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> with channels <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> enable the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> to be slidably mounted within channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. The length of channels <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> limits the longitudinal travel of the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> is a generally cylindrical tubular structure, preferably having a portion of its circumference (preferably about 50&deg;) cut-away towards the forward bottom portions thereof to enable the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> to receive the lower feed track portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> as it moves rearwardly into the tool against the force of spring <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during a fastener driving operation. The nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> may also be provided with one or more longitudinally extending interior tracks or ribs <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> that cooperate with corresponding tracks or ribs (not shown) on the external surface of the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> so that the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> can slide in controlled fashion relative to the channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As can be seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the nose receiving channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> is fixed to the housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and also has its rearward end fixed to the forward end of the striker assembly guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> by appropriate fasteners <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> extending through respective abutting annular flanges <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and of the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, respectively. The preferred guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, as with the previous embodiments, is a cylindrical tubular structure and has an air vent <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> towards the forward end thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) that vents displaced air from in front of the plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The connection between the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> with the striker assembly guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> also serves to secure a mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. Specifically, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, an annular recess <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> is formed in the rear end of nose receiving channel member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> to receive an annular flange <highlight><bold>277</bold></highlight> of the mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> has a main cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> extending axially in parallel relation to the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. The forward end of the mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> has a radially inwardly projecting flange <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>, which terminates in slidable abutting relation with the cylindrical outer surface of a fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the fastener head engages structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is generally tubular member having a rearward end telescopingly received in the mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The forward end portion of fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is received within an axial bore <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> radially outwardly projecting flange <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> at the rear end of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> has a forward surface thereof abutting against the flange <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> of the tubular mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> so that the rear end of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is retained within the mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> acts as a guide tube for the driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> received therethrough. The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> also serves to engage the head of a fastener being driven and to maintain the fastener in spaced relation, at a predetermined spaced distance, from the guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> throughout a drive stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>279</bold></highlight> of the mounting structure <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> has a diameter which is sufficiently large so as to be radially outwardly spaced from the driver <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Disposed within this space is a resilient elastomeric tubular structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> generally cylindrical in shape. The forward annular edge of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> engages the rearward surface of the annular flange <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> of fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. The rearward annular edge of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> engages the forwardly facing surface of the resilient bumper <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is formed from a rubber-based material, as is the bumper <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed/molded with the bumper <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> (by being engaged therewith) to permit limited longitudinal movement of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> relative to the striker assembly guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is constructed and arranged to dampen the engagement (and any slight impact) between the forward end of the fastener engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> and the head of a fastener being driven (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>). Specifically, the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is longitudinally compressed or stressed by the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> under the force and weight of the tool bearing upon the fastener being driven (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). When the driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> impacts the head of the fastener with each stroke, the head of the fastener being driven may become slightly forwardly spaced from the forward, annular fastener engaging surface <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. When the driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is retracted, the force of gravity acting on the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or the application of force by the user to the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> maintains the forward edge <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in contact with the head of the fastener being driven. Any slight impacts between the forward edge <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and the head of the fastener being driven are damped by the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at rest, prior to cycling of the driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, and with a fastener <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> disposed in the drive track <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is in its fully extended position under the force of coil spring <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates an initial stage of tool operation, i.e., the user has pulled the trigger and has forced the forward end of nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> against a workpiece W to compress spring <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> a predetermined distance to activate a nose switch <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> connected with a control circuit that commences cycling of the plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and driver <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The feed mechanism <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> has a roller <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> that rides along a track <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> as the nose element <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is forced against a workpiece and moves into the housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> against the bias of coil spring <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. When the roller <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> reaches a contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of a nose switch, which contact portion is disposed along the track <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>, control circuitry within the tool causes motor <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> is energized to commence cycling of the tool. The nose switch contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is illustrated schematically, and the electrical connection between the nose switch contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> is not shown, nor is the control circuit shown in detail, as those skilled in the art will appreciate that these types of elements and connections can be one of several different known constructions and still fall within the scope the present invention. When the nose switch contact trip <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> remains depressed, the tool continues to cycle. When the roller <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> rides past the mechanical contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> after the nose assembly is forced into the housing (which in the embodiment shown is in the form of an elongated button) the control circuit sends a signal to shut down the motor (or in a contemplated embodiment, first slows down the motor to a fraction of its duty cycle before completely shutting the motor down). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As the tool is subsequently pulled away from the workpiece, the nose assembly is permitted to project outwardly from the housing, and the roller rides down a different, adjacent return path, which is parallel to the surface <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> so that it does not depress contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> on its return as the nose is extended out from the housing after a fastening operation. This can be accomplished by a cross-over railroad track type intersection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to an elongated contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, the roller <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> may be provided with a cam follower that maintains engagement with a smaller contact portion <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly is moved into the housing, but releases the contact portion once the nose assembly is moved fully into the housing. In any event, the contact portion remains depressed until the nose assembly is substantially fully received within the housing, at which point the contact portion is released to permit the circuit and motor to terminate the fastening cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As the roller <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> rides up ramp <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> of the track <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> as the tool is pressed against a workpiece to commence a fastening operation, the feed mechanism <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> pivots about a pivot <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> to enable a feed pawl (also not shown) to engage the collated fasteners <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and move a lead fastener <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> into the drive track <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> has commenced its initial retraction within the guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, however, it should be appreciated that the present embodiment contemplates that initial movement of the plunger <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> need not commence at this stage. Rather, it is possible to design the tool such that it only commences cycling after the nose member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is sufficiently moved rearwardly within the tool a sufficient distance such that the forward point of fastener <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> engages workpiece W. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an enlarged partial sectional view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, but illustrates the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> towards the end of a fastening operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The resiliency of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight>, the length of driver member&apos;s <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> forward extension beyond the forward end of fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> during the drive stroke, the downward force applied when using the tool, among other factors, may have a bearing on the separation between the head of the fastener being driven and the forward surface <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. In any case, it should be appreciated that the resiliency of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> minimizes the distance of, or can practically eliminate the disengagement between the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> and the head of the fastener being driven during the drive and return strokes. That is, when the forward end of the driver member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> extends forwardly of the fastener contacting forward edge of fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, the resiliency of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> enables the fastener contacting edge of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> to remain closely coupled with or remain only slightly spaced from the head of the fastener with each stroke. The resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is compressed slightly during each return stroke under the weight (force) of the tool, and decompresses slightly at the end of each drive stroke to maintain the close engagement between the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> and the head of the fastener being driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> By providing the resilient structure coupled with fastener head engaging structure, the operation of the tool becomes much smoother and vibrations are effectively damped, thus eliminating tool bounce off the fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> maintains the head of the fastener being driven spaced a predetermined distance relative to the guide track <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, which distance varies essentially only as a function of the resilience of the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the resilient structure <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> is made from a urethane material, which is the same urethane material that forms bumper <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment specifically described and shown, the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is formed as a separate structure from the nose assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated, however, that the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> may constitute part of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in alternate embodiments contemplated by this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> illustrate a fourth embodiment of a multi-stroke fastening device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention for driving a fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into a workpiece, generally shown at W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>.

Thus, rotation of the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> causes reciprocating motion of the crank arm <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> which translates into reciprocating motion of the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> within the guide track <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Unlike the illustrated embodiments of the previous embodiments, the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> of the present invention is driven by the gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> provides a three-stage spur gear drive. A drive gear <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> of the gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is mounted to an output shaft <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight> of a motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, which motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> rotatably drives the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> via the gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. Gears <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> of the gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> are mounted on shafts <highlight><bold>3721</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3731</bold></highlight> received in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Washers and spacers placed on opposing sides of the gears <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> prevent axial movement of the gears <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> along the shafts <highlight><bold>3721</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3731</bold></highlight>. Gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is mounted on the shaft <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> to drive the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. Gear <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is secured on the shaft <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> between a pair of bearings <highlight><bold>3771</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3772</bold></highlight>, which are mounted in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Although the above-described gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is preferred, it, however, is contemplated by the inventors that other coupling arrangements as described above in connection with the other embodiments may be employed. For example, it is contemplated that a pulley and belt arrangement could be used to provide the multiple strokes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The power drive assembly <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> via a substantially sealed air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. As appreciated in the previous embodiments, the pressurization of the air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> drives the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, and hence the entire driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> forwardly, so that the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> impacts upon the head of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the initial impact of the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> upon the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> tends to force the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> towards a bottom surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> due to the interconnection of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> with the coil of fasteners <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> by the collation material <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is constructed and arranged to counter this initial effect, as will be discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> does not impact the bumper <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> at the end of each impact drive stroke. Sufficient space <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is provided between the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and the bumper <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> wherein the resistance of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> being driven into the workpiece W serves to stop the movement of the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> prior to the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> impacting on the bumper <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. The space <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> allows all the energy of the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, during the impact drive stroke, to be absorbed by the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. Thus, no energy will be lost due to impact with the bumper <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, which conserves power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After each impact stroke, the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is drawn rearwardly within the guide track <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> as a result of its being coupled to the power drive assembly <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. More particularly, as the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is withdrawn within the guide track <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> by the action of the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, a vacuum is created in the substantially sealed air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> so as to draw the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> rearwardly with the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the operative coupling provided by the air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> substantially cushions the driving impact of the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> upon the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. This reduces vibration of the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and provides for a quieter operation. In addition, after the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is pulled back by the vacuum in air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> instantaneously reverses direction so as to commence forward movement, a pressure pulse or spike is generated in air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, thus creating high levels of kinetic energy for driving the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> forwardly. The air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in effect acts as an air spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that because the vibrations of the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are reduced, the life of the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be increased, and the user experiences less fatigue from use of the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A power source, generally shown at <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight>, for supplying power to the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> to operate the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, is removably mounted on a lower portion of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>. The power source <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> is in the form of a rechargeable battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> has battery contacts, which can be removed from housing contacts <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> to enable the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to be recharged and/or replaced. It is contemplated that the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of batteries contained within a battery housing wherein each battery can be individually recharged and/or replaced. It should be appreciated that other power sources <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> may be used for powering the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. For example, the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be connected with line voltage, an air pressure supply where the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is pneumatically driven, combustion power, etc. It should be appreciated, however, that a self-contained battery powered device provides the operator with greater versatility and maneuverability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes a releasable battery retainer, generally shown at <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, for releasably retaining the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. The battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> has a pair of rigid flanges located on an upper surface, which are slidably received in flanges formed in a lower portion of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>3805</bold></highlight> in the upper surface is positioned to receive the battery retainer <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> to secure the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is slided thereon. The battery retainer <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted within the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and includes a camming portion <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> and a releasing portion <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> that extend through openings in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The camming portion <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> engages the upper surface of the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> as the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> slides on the flanges, whereby the battery retainer <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> pivots about an axis provided by pins <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> until the camming portion <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> is received within the recess <highlight><bold>3805</bold></highlight>. The camming portion <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> is biased into engagement with the recess <highlight><bold>3805</bold></highlight> by a spring <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> received between the releasing portion <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> and a spring retainer <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> that extends through a hole in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Depression of the releasing portion <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> pivots the camming portion <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> about the axis pins <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>, against the biasing of the spring <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, out of the recess <highlight><bold>3805</bold></highlight> to release the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> for sliding movement in order to remove the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Although the above-described battery retainer <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is preferred because it provides for both easy mounting and removal of the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, it is contemplated that other assemblies may be used to releasably secure the battery <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The structure of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> will now be described in greater detail. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is releasably secured to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to permit axial movement of the same in a direction along a fastener driving axis. Specifically, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> has a slidably mounted supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> on an upper portion thereof, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. A nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is fixed within the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> towards a forward portion of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with a grooved track that receives projecting flanges <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, or laterally extending wings, provided on opposite sides of the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> so that the channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> slidably receives the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and hence the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. A nose releasing assembly releasably, generally shown at <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 28</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, secures the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as will be discussed. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is guided axially into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> by the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> during a driving operation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is a generally cylindrical tubular structure having a forward bottom portion of its circumference cut-away to enable the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> to receive a feed mechanism, generally shown at <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>, described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> A spring assembly <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, in the form of a coil spring, biases the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> outwardly from the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The present invention, however, is not limited to the use of the spring; rather, other biasing assemblies are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. One end of the spring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is supported by a support <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight> connected to the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. The opposite end of the spring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is supported by a guide <highlight><bold>3212</bold></highlight> received within the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. A projection <highlight><bold>3171</bold></highlight> on the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> serves as a forward stop of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> which is biased outwardly from the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> by the spring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The support <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight> and the guide <highlight><bold>3212</bold></highlight> each have openings to receive the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and a fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> acts as a guide tube for the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> which is received therethrough. The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> also serves to engage the head of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> being driven and to maintain the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> in spaced relation, at a predetermined spaced distance, from the guide track <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> throughout a drive stroke. The fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is channel shaped and extends through the openings of the support <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight>, the guide <highlight><bold>3212</bold></highlight>, and the spring assembly <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. A rearward end <highlight><bold>3661</bold></highlight> of the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is received within the support <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight> and provides the opening <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> in which the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> extends through. The rearward end <highlight><bold>3661</bold></highlight> rests against a flanged portion of the bumper <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> when the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is secured within the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The guide <highlight><bold>3212</bold></highlight> is configured and positioned to guide the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> within the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> moves relative the fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> when the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is retracted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The nose releasing assembly <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> for releasably securing the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> comprises a pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> that provides an engagement recess <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> adapted to receive an engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is formed on the supporting structure <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and engages the engagement recess <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> upon insertion of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> within the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that the recess <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> may be located on the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and the engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> may be located on the pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and includes an actuator assembly <highlight><bold>3231</bold></highlight>. The actuator assembly <highlight><bold>3231</bold></highlight> extends through an opening in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for operating the nose releasing assembly <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to release the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The location of the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>3231</bold></highlight> permits easy operation by the user (e.g. finger operation) to remove the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> The pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> also includes a projection engagement surface <highlight><bold>3232</bold></highlight> for engaging the engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, whereby the pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> pivots about an axis, provided by projections <highlight><bold>3233</bold></highlight> supported by the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, such that the engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is received within the engagement recess <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. The engagement recess <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is biased into engagement with the engagement projection <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> by resilient arm members <highlight><bold>3234</bold></highlight> extending from the pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> and positioned on platforms in the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The nose releasing assembly <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> facilitates removal of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, without the use of tools, in order to remove jams, or repair the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. This minimizes downtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> terminates at a generally elliptically-shaped aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in one end of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> through which the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> passes as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>. The shape of the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> assists in ensuring the proper orientation of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W. The elliptical shape assists to control both horizontal and vertical movement of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. The fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> includes an angled guide surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and an upper guide surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> adjacent the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The angled guide surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which forms a portion of the bottom surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, adjusts the orientation of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> while the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W. Specifically, the angled surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> directs the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> in a generally upward direction as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> passes through the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This tends to counteract the initial downward movement of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> due to its connection with the coil of collated fasteners <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. If the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is not correctly oriented as it is driven, the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> may be deformed and/or driven into the workpiece W incorrectly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the interconnection of fasteners <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> by the collation material <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> causes the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> to pivot about the collation connection with an adjacent fastener in a generally downwardly direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. The fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> engages the angled surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and is directed towards the center of the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The collation material <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> fractures as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is continually driven. Further, as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> travels up the angled surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> where it exits, relative movement occurs between the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> slightly crosses over the fastener driving axis of the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> as it exits from the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> A portion of the angled guide surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is located on a pivoting assembly, generally shown at <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, which is part of the feed assembly <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> for feeding the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, as will be discussed. This portion of the angled guide surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> pivots away from the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> while the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is being loaded into the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by the feed mechanism <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. Further, because a portion of the angled guide surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is located on the pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be more compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The upper guide surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is provided on an upper guide member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> which is pivotally attached to the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and partially covers the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> during predetermined operating conditions, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upper guide surface <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> pivots away from the aperture <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> when contacted by the fastener and fastener head engaging structure <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> in response to compression of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> as the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the dispensing assembly <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> may also be replaced with an attachment assembly wherein the engaging member <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> has an annular wall enclosing the disc-shaped structure <highlight><bold>3391</bold></highlight>. Conventional fasteners may be loaded separately into the attachment assembly. The snap action feature of the C-shaped clamps <highlight><bold>3393</bold></highlight> of the attachment assembly facilitates assembly of any contemplated attachment assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> As described above, it has been found that coated fasteners are especially useful in connection with the operation of the fastening device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or any of the other devices described above where reductions in power consumption are desired. The coating facilitates insertion of the fasteners <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the workpiece W, which results in an overall reduction in power consumption. Each of the nails, or also referred to as fasteners <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, of the coil of collated roofing nails <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> has a shank portion <highlight><bold>3331</bold></highlight> with a shank diameter of about 0.120&Prime;&plusmn;0.0015&Prime; and a head portion <highlight><bold>3332</bold></highlight> with a head diameter of about 0.350&Prime;-0.438&Prime;. The head diameter is preferably about 0.354&Prime;-0.384&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Moreover, each of the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is coated with a thermoplastic material <highlight><bold>3333</bold></highlight> that serves as a lubricant which facilitates driving of the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into a workpiece W so as to reduce the energy required to drive the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the workpiece W. Thus, battery power can be conserved resulting in increased battery life. Since less energy or force is required to drive the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, wear to the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is reduced which increases the life of the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as well. Further, the thermoplastic coating acts as an adhesive after the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> are driven into the workpiece W, which increases the strength of connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Each of the nails <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from steel or stainless steel. Other materials having similar physical properties are considered to be well within the scope of the present invention. The collation material <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> includes at least one flexible wire <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight> that interconnects the plurality of collated roofing nails <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, two flexible wires <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight> are used. The flexible wires <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight> are secured to a portion of the shank portion <highlight><bold>3331</bold></highlight>, by spot-welding or use of an adhesive. The wires <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight> fracture as one of the collated nails is driven. into the workpiece W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The operation of the fastening device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will now be described in greater detail. First, the operator manually grasps the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> about a gripping portion of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and positions his/her finger on the trigger <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>. Then, the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is positioned into engagement with the workpiece W, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The operator provides a suitable amount of pressure on the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to retract the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> must be progressively retracted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in order to activate the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> to operate the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, both the trigger switch <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight> and the energy control assembly <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> must be actuated in order to operate the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is retracted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> with the trigger <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> being depressed by the operator, the first ramping surface <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> of the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> contacts a camming surface <highlight><bold>3094</bold></highlight> of the camming portion <highlight><bold>3092</bold></highlight> which moves the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> into contact with an activating button <highlight><bold>3082</bold></highlight> of the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to actuate the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> continues to move relatively to the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> slides along side surfaces <highlight><bold>3095</bold></highlight> of the camming portion <highlight><bold>3092</bold></highlight> to side surfaces <highlight><bold>3096</bold></highlight> of the adjustable camming portion <highlight><bold>3093</bold></highlight>. As long as the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> is in contact with surfaces <highlight><bold>3094</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3095</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3096</bold></highlight> of the camming portions <highlight><bold>3092</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3093</bold></highlight>, the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> will remain in contact with the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to continue to energize the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> which cycles the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to drive the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the workpiece W, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Specifically, once the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is energized, the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> drives the crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> via the gear train <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> which crank member <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> causes the reciprocating motion of the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> via the crank arm <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> drives the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> via the sealed air space <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Thus, the reciprocating motion of the piston <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> causes the reciprocating motion of the driver member <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which drives the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the workpiece W by a plurality of impacts upon the head of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. As the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is driven into the workpiece W, the angled surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> as well as the upper guide surface <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> adjust the orientation of the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> so the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> can be driven substantially perpendicular to the workpiece W, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The retracting action of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> also functions to operate the feed assembly <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> to advance the next fastener into the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The advancing assembly <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> cooperates with the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> to advance the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> into the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> travels from a first position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 19</cross-reference>, to a second position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>, along the first surface <highlight><bold>3611</bold></highlight> within the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in response to compression of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> against the biasing of the spring assembly <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The gripping arm housing <highlight><bold>3604</bold></highlight> slides along the guide portions <highlight><bold>3956</bold></highlight> of the first housing part <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>, thus moving the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> from a rest position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, to an advancing position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>, as the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> travels along the first surface <highlight><bold>3611</bold></highlight> between the first position and the second position. As the gripping arm housing <highlight><bold>3604</bold></highlight> slides along the guide portions <highlight><bold>3956</bold></highlight>, the fastener receiving portion <highlight><bold>3971</bold></highlight> retracts from the feed path <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>, against the biasing of a spring assembly when a portion <highlight><bold>3972</bold></highlight> of the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> contacts an additional fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>following the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is held by the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Once the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> clears the adjustable camming portion <highlight><bold>3093</bold></highlight> of the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is released from contact from the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> resiliently returning to a rest position spaced from the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> shuts off. The switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> must be reactivated in order to reactivate the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> to cycle the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. In order to do this, the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> must be pulled away from the workpiece W so the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can extend outwardly from the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> under biasing of the spring assembly <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> so that the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be depressed again. As the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is forced outwardly of the nose receiving channel <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the second ramping surface <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> of the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> contacts a camming surface <highlight><bold>3097</bold></highlight> of the adjustable camming portion <highlight><bold>3093</bold></highlight> which cams the switch activating assembly <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> in a direction away from the activating button <highlight><bold>3082</bold></highlight> of the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> so that the switch assembly <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> does not become depressed and reactivate the striker assembly <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> before the device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is repositioned, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 46</cross-reference>. The nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> slides along side surfaces <highlight><bold>3098</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3099</bold></highlight> of the camming portions <highlight><bold>3093</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3092</bold></highlight> opposite the side surfaces <highlight><bold>3095</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3096</bold></highlight> until the nose actuating assembly <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> clears the camming portion <highlight><bold>3092</bold></highlight>, whereby the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> can be repositioned and depressed again by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The trigger <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> can remain depressed by the operator and movement of the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> between extended and retracted positions would be the means by which to shut off and restart the motor <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> between fastening operations. The energy control assembly <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> reduces power consumption by the fastening device by terminating operation of the driver assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> at the predetermined operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> After a fastening operation, as the spring assembly <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> biases the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> out of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> travels a predetermined distance along a second surface <highlight><bold>3641</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> within the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> from the second position to a third position along the second surface <highlight><bold>3641</bold></highlight>. The gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> remain in the advancing position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>, as the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> travels from the second position to the third position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>, the fastener receiving portion <highlight><bold>3971</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive the additional fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) which follows the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) held by the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> engages a pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is being compressed. The pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is spring biased into engagement with the track <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> and provides the second surface <highlight><bold>3641</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight>. The follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> first engages the bottom surface <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight> of the pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> as it moves up the track <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> which pivots the arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> upwardly allowing the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> to move to the second position against the biasing of the spring positioned at the pivot axis. The pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> returns to its engagement with the track <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> due to the spring which allows the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> to ride along the second surface <highlight><bold>3641</bold></highlight> of the pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> to the third position as the nose assembly <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is biased outwardly from the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. This prevents the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> from returning along the track <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight> to the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> return to the rest position when the advancing assembly <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> moves from the third position to the first position, due to the biasing of the spring on the feed pawl <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> as it moves the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> from the third position to the first position through the recess <highlight><bold>3643</bold></highlight> in the pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> in a quick snapping action. This snapping action causes the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> of the feed mechanism <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> to quckly return to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>. More specifically, a recess <highlight><bold>3643</bold></highlight> in the pivoting arm <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> allows the follower <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> to return to the first position. Thus, the entire collation of fasteners <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly as the fastener receiving portion <highlight><bold>3971</bold></highlight> engaged with the additional fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is moved upwardly. The additional fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) contacts a surface <highlight><bold>3981</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> on the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> to release the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>, whereby the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> advance the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) into the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, whereupon the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> engages the additional fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) when the gripping arms <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> return to the rest position. Further, because the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> forms a part of the pivoting assembly <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the releasing of the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> also pivots the portion of the angled surface <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the portion of bottom surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> away from the fastener drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to allow the fastener <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to be loaded into the drive track <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>.
