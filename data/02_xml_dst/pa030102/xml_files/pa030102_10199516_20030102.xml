<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A gas blocking device is used in an optical fiber repeater or other device to prevent the passage of gas, for example, to prevent nitrogen from escaping from a pressurized housing through a fiber holding tube or pigtail. The gas blocking device includes a fiber containing body, a fiber organizing insert, and a locking member securing the insert to one end of the body. The fiber containing body is attached to one end of the fiber holding tube. The fibers extend from the fiber holding tube through a passageway in the body, and each of the fibers extends through a fiber receiving hole in the fiber organizing insert. The insert engages the body such that the insert is prevented from rotating with respect to the body and the fibers are protected against microbending and other damage. A material, such as hot melt glue, fills at least a portion of the body and surrounds the fibers to block the gas from entering the fiber holding tube. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to fiber optic systems and, more particularly, to a gas blocking device used to permit the passage of optical fibers while preventing the passage of gas therethrough. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Repeaters are commonly used in fiber optic systems to amplify optical signals being transmitted over long distances. A repeater body is coupled to a fiber optic cable at each end. The repeater body houses electronic circuitry and lasers used to amplify the optical signals. Lasers and electronics housed in the repeater body should be maintained under very dry conditions, because the slightest amount of condensation in the repeater can cause arcing. Arcing can be devastating to the operation of the system. Maintaining these very dry conditions is most important in undersea applications but also applies as well to terrestrial applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To achieve these dry conditions, prior to installation, the repeater housing is vacuum drawn and the air is replaced with pressurized nitrogen to prevent moisture from entering the repeater housing. To enable the repeater housing to maintain the pressurized nitrogen, it is conventional to route optical fibers entering and exiting the repeater through a seal. One known system for creating the seal includes routing the fibers through a plastic tube on the outside of the repeater housing. A compressible rubber stopper is then inserted in one end of the plastic tube to seal the end of the plastic tube. The rubber stopper is punctured one hole at a time for each optical fiber in the bundle and each fiber is routed through a respective hole during the puncturing process. The compressible nature of the rubber stopper is intended to create an individual seal with each optical fiber. At least one drawback of this conventional seal and sealing method is that the assembly is labor intensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Additionally, this type of sealing assembly is better suited for water blockage. Because the sealing assembly relies on a friction fit between the rubber stopper and the plastic tube and fibers, the nitrogen in the pressurized housing interior could still potentially escape through the seal if tight tolerances are not achieved. Furthermore, this existing sealing assembly had difficulty accepting more than eight fibers due to the inherent material properties of the rubber stopper and the difficulty in drawing the fiber through the rubber. This sealing assembly thus could not easily accommodate the increased number of fibers in high fiber count cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a gas blocking device that is easier to install, that has improved sealing properties, and that is capable of accommodating an increased number of fibers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, an optical fiber device is provided. The optical fiber device comprises a housing that is vacuum drawn and pressurized with a gas to prevent moisture from entering the housing. An optical fiber holding tube extends through a wall in the housing such that a first end of the optical fiber holding tube is contained in the housing and a second end of the tube is located outside the housing. A plurality of optical fibers extends from the first end of the optical fiber holding tube to the second end of the optical fiber holding tube without interruption. A gas blocking device is attached to the first end of the optical fiber holding tube. The optical fibers extend through the gas blocking device and are surrounded by a material, creating a seal that prevents the gas from passing through the optical fiber holding tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a gas blocking device is provided for use with an optical fiber holding tube. The gas blocking device comprises a fiber containing body having a passageway for receiving a plurality of fibers from the optical fiber holding tube. A material, such as hot melt glue, at least partially fills the passageway of the fiber containing body and surrounds the plurality of fibers passing through the passageway. A fiber organizing insert is secured at one end of the fiber containing body and has a plurality of fiber receiving holes for receiving respective ones of the plurality of fibers. The fiber organizing insert and the fiber containing body preferably include cooperating key structures such that the fiber organizing insert is prevented from rotating with respect to the fiber containing body. A locking member preferably secures the fiber organizing insert to the one end of the fiber containing body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the passageway within the fiber containing body includes a wide portion, a narrow portion, and a tapered portion between the narrow portion and the wide portion. The narrow portion of the passageway preferably has an inside diameter dimensioned such that the fibers act as strength members within the material in the narrow portion. For example, the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the fibers to the cross-sectional area of the narrow portion is about &frac12;. The fiber organizing insert is secured within the wide portion of the passageway and is preferably made of a substantially non-compressible material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the gas blocking device is provided as an assembly comprising the fiber containing body for receiving the fibers and the material, the fiber organizing insert adapted to be positioned at one end of the fiber containing body, and the locking member adapted to lock the fiber organizing insert to the fiber containing body.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, according to the present invention, is used to substantially prevent or block the passage of gas while allowing optical fibers to pass through. According to the exemplary embodiment, the gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used in an optical fiber repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be used in other devices that house optical fibers, such as a joint box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives, amplifies, and retransmits signals being carried by a fiber optic cable. Repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> containing a signal processing and routing system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a laser (not shown). An end cover or wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> covers the end of the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a cone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> encloses the end of the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An optical fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, sometimes referred to as a pigtail, extends from inside the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the end cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and out of the cone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A tube seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is incorporated where the fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends through the end cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to make the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> water tight in that area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A cable structure (not shown) is connected to the cone <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and optical fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend from the cable structure through the optical fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to carry signals to and/or from the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> exit the end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the optical fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within a fiber tray <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> inside the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are coupled in a known manner to the signal processing and routing system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A similar arrangement exists at the other end of the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This enables the signals transmitted by the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to one end of the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be received, amplified and retransmitted to the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the other end of the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To prevent moisture or condensation from entering the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is vacuum drawn and the air is replaced with pressurized nitrogen or another suitable gas. The repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is typically pressurized to about 30 to 35 psi. The gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to the end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the optical fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> inside of the repeater housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and prevents the pressurized gas from exiting the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the optical fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also prevents gas from entering the repeater <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, includes an elongated fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend through the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into a passageway through the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at one end and pass out of the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the opposite end. The locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> secures the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as hot melt glue, surrounds the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and seals the passageway around the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing gas from passing through the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Hot melt glue has the preferred capability of being re-heated and softened to allow adjustment of the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as needed. Other types of material, such as epoxy or other adhesives, may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the passageway in the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a wide portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a tapered portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> therebetween. The wide portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and tapered portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> allow the material or adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to flow into the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the passageway where the sealing takes place. The fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> preferably act as strength members within the material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> similar to the manner in which steel is used to reinforce concrete. For example, when the gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is frozen, the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> hold the adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> together and prevent the adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from cracking. To allow the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to act as strength members and provide this reinforcement, the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the passageway should not be too wide. The narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably has an inside diameter just large enough to receive the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and to allow the material or adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to flow into the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and seal the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The ratio of the cross-sectional area of the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the cross-sectional area of the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably about &frac12;. In one example, the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may have an inside diameter of about {fraction (1/16)} in. This size is capable of accommodating about 16 to 24 fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Although only four fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> for purposes of clarity, it is contemplated that multiple fibers may be used, for example 16 to 24 fibers or perhaps even more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The adhesive <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably fills at least substantially the entire length of the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the passageway. The narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably has a minimum length sufficient for pressure sealing purposes. In the exemplary embodiment, the length of the narrow portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is about 1.5 in. Although the exemplary embodiment is shown with a specific shape, the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can have other shapes, sizes and configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment, the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, has a center plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a seating flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that seats the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relative to the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes preformed fiber receiving holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through which the individual optical fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend and enter into the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Although the exemplary embodiment shows the holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> arranged as a single circle, the preformed fiber receiving holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be arranged in two or more concentric circles to accommodate additional fiber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a rigid, substantially non-compressible material, such as plastic, that will not scratch or damage the fibers and will withstand being heated and frozen. The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is thus capable of accommodating more fibers than the compressible rubber stoppers used in the conventional sealing devices. Although plastic is used in the exemplary embodiment, other suitable materials may also be used. The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also have other shapes, sizes and configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engages the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that the seating flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is seated at the end of the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the center plug <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends into the wide portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably include cooperating key structures for preventing rotation of the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with respect to the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. By preventing rotation when the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is engaged with the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the cooperating key structures prevent undesirable twisting of the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thus organizes and restrains the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to prevent microbending and other damage to the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the exemplary embodiment of the cooperating key structures, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> locking key <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engages a locking recess <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the seating flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The locking key <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> preferably extends from the end of the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably includes multiple locking recesses <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to facilitate positioning of the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although one embodiment of the cooperating key structures is shown and described, any arrangement of cooperating key structures capable of preventing rotation may be used. For example, the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may include a single locking recess <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> or the fiber containing body may include multiple locking keys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may have keys or projections engaging recesses in the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is secured against the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes an inner extending flange <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extending over the end of the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a base <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending around the outside of the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is secured to the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example, by a threaded engagement. According to the exemplary embodiment, the base <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a shaped portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (e.g., hexagonal) that may interface with a tool, such as a wrench. The locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may also be attached to the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in other ways. When the locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is secured to the body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the inner extending flange <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> bears against the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to effectively sandwich the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> between the locking member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To assemble the gas blocking device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is secured to the end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the fiber holding tube <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are both preferably made of copper and may be secured by soldering. Although copper is preferred because of its good conductability, other materials may also be used. The fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are inserted into the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the fiber containing body <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each of the fibers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is inserted through one of the fiber receiving holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the fiber organizing insert <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
