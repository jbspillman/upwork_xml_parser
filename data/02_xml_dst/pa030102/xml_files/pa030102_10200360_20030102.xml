<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to gaming machines and more particularly to a gaming machine with an extendable bet button to provide increased player comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various types of gaming machines are known. When playing such gaming machines, players normally sit at a chair or stool in front of the gaming machine, rigidly mounted a fixed distance from the gaming machine, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,232,191 and 5,762,617. The location of the gaming machine controls, for example, results in the player either leaning or being hunched forward. In order to improve player comfort, some known gaming machine stools come with footrests or a foot rail to enable players to rest their feet. However, the position of the gaming controls, for example, rigidly mounted thereto as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,397, requires players to lean or hunch forward during play. Continued play in a hunched position can cause player discomfort and fatigue. Such fatigue and discomfort thus limits the amount of time player will play a gaming machine. Unfortunately, due to the configuration of the machine, there is little a player can do to change positions. Thus, there is a need for an improved gaming machine which provides improved player comfort. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Improved Gaming Machine Configuration </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an improved gaming machine housing configuration, in accordance with the present invention, provides improved player comfort while at the same time provides a relatively small footprint to optimize the number of gaming machines that can occupy a given area on a casino floor. As shown, the gaming machine housing, in accordance with the present invention, generally identified with the reference numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, may be provided with an integral or separate pedestal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The height of the pedestal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is selected so that the height of the player controls and video display surface are compatible with a standard gaming machine stool <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21, 22</cross-reference>), for example, as manufactured by Gary Platt Manufacturing Inc. or as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,191, hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the gaming machine housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is of irregular shape and is configured to enable the video display <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be carried in a plane at an angle A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), relative to a vertical datum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The angle A is selected to improve player comfort in a manner similar to that of a conventional slant top machine while at the same time providing the type of visibility of the video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as conventional upright gaming machines. The angle A may be varied from about 5&deg; to 85&deg;, preferable between 20&deg; and 40&deg;, relative to the vertical datum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In accordance with another important aspect of the invention, the sides of the housing are formed at least in part to converge toward one another. Such a configuration reduces the footprint of the machine in order to optimize the number of gaming machines that can be placed in a given area on a casino or other gambling facility floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important aspect of the gaming machine housing, the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the gaming machine in a manner to enable it to be pulled out to an extended position as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> and to pivot as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> from the extended position. This configuration allows gaming machines to be placed closer together while at the same time providing full access to the interior of the gaming machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an exemplary gaming machine housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated which includes a front housing portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>), left and right side housing portions, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>), a top housing potion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), a rear housing portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and a bottom housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The front housing portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>) may be divided into an upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</cross-reference>) and a lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be pivotally mounted, for example, about a pivot axis <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to enable the upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be pivoted from a closed position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to an open position, as shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to provide access to the video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for maintenance and replacement. In order to prevent unauthorized access into the gaming machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a latch or other locking arrangement (not shown) may be is used to secure the upper front housing <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in a latched position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is used to frame a video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example, a cathode ray tube video display. As such, the upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided with a central rectangular aperture <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, sized in accordance with the dimensions of the video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and formed with beveled surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> around the rectangular aperture <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to frame the video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and eliminate any gaps between the video display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may also be formed with extending sidewalls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) adapted to overlap the left and right side housing portions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, respectively, in a closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is formed with a first surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The angle of the first surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is selected so that it is coplanar with the upper front housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>.

<heading lvl="1">Dual Action Door Hinging </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Access doors are normally provided on the front of gaming machines to provide access to the interior of the machine for in-situ maintenance and repair of the gaming machine on the casino floor. Such access doors limit how close gaming machines may be placed on a casino floor. More specifically, access doors normally are provided on the lower front portion of the gaming machine. Such access doors are normally hinged on one end. Unfortunately, the configuration of such gaming machines limits how close gaming machines can be placed while still enabling the access door to be fully opened. In particular, in many known gaming machines, the player controls are carried by an outwardly extending surface which extends outwardly relative to the plane of the access door. Such a configuration requires a certain amount of spacing between the machines in order for the access door to have sufficient clearance to be fully opened. In order to minimize the spacing between gaming machines, a dual-action access door in accordance with the present invention is provided which allows gaming machines to be placed relatively close together while at the same time providing the full access to the interior of the machine. In particular, FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrate a dual-action door assembly that enables the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to be opened much like a file cabinet drawer from a closed position, as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to an extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. Provisions are also provided to enable the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to pivot in an extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to enable full access to the interior of the gaming machine for in-situ maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is carried by a door chassis assembly, generally identified with the reference numeral <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The door chassis assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> includes a vertical frame number <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and two horizontal frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The vertical frame number <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and one of the horizontal frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are joined together at their respective ends to form an L-shaped configuration, generally parallel to the vertical datum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). An opposing end of the horizontal frame <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) is connected to one end of the horizontal frame member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> forming an L-shaped configuration, generally parallel to horizontal datum <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Three telescoping drawer rails, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are rigidly secured on one end to the frame members <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, for example, with suitable fasteners or by welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The horizontal frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be formed with generally square or rectangular cross-sections. However, frame member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be formed from J-channel for additional stiffening. The telescoping drawer rails <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are rigidly attached to one end to the vertical frame member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with suitable fasteners. The drawer rail <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is attached on one end to the horizontal frame member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The opposing ends of the drawer rails <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are attached to the interior of the left and right housing portions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with suitable fasteners. In order to provide additional stiffening, stiffening plates may be used. For example, a stiffening plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be attached directly to the interior of the left side housing portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with suitable fasteners. The drawer rails <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may then be attached to the stiffening plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to provide additional stiffening, a gusset plate <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may be rigidly attached to the stiffening plate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and rest on the bottom housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. An additional gusset plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be rigidly secured in the corner of the vertical frame member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the horizontal frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The gusset plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> provides additional stiffening of the door chassis <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The door chassis assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> enables the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to slide out in a similar manner to a file drawer from a closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to an extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted on one end about an axis generally parallel to a vertical datum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The pivotal mounting enables the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to pivot from a closed position when the door chassis assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is in a partially or fully extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> to an open position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, thus providing a dual-action door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In order to pivotally mount the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> relative to the door chassis <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, upper and lower hinge assemblies <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are provided. Each hinge assembly <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> includes two brackets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The brackets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> are rigidly attached to the interior of the front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> while the brackets <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are attached to the vertical support <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Each of the brackets <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> are formed from a horizontal member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a pin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> configured to be generally parallel to the vertical datum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) when secured to the vertical supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> defining a vertical pivot axis. The brackets <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are formed from a pair of members <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> configured in a generally L-shape. The members <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are provided with apertures (not shown) for receiving the pins <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to enable the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to pivot about a vertical axis on the left side of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The right side of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is secured by upper and lower latch assemblies <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> respectively. The upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> while the lower latch assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring first to FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the lower latch assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes a bullet pin assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed with a flat surface <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, attached or secured directly to the horizontal frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a ramped surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The flat surface <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed with an aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for latching the bullet pin assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The bullet pin assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes a bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, spring loaded by way of a spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In a latched position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is biased downwardly into the aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The tension of the spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is selected such that a relatively small horizontal force on the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> causes the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to move upwardly and compress the spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, thus unlatching the bullet pin assembly <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> from the latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The ramped surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> causes the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to move upwardly, thus compressing the spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is moved toward a closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The compression forces of the spring <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> bias the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> downwardly as the top of the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> slides across the flat surface <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Once the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is over the aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the latch plate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the bullet pin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is biased downwardly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, latching the right lower portion of the lower front housing position <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to the door chassis <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrate the upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is used to latch the upper right side of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in a closed position for example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> must be unlatched in order to allow the door chassis assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to be pulled out to an extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is similar to a car door latch assembly and includes pair of parallel spaced apart L-shaped brackets <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> extending there between forming a bracket assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to the interior of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> access door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A latch subassembly <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is formed on the interior of the right side housing portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The latch subassembly <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> includes a plate <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, rigidly attached to the right housing portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a generally U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the bracket assembly <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is adapted to be received in the U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. A latching mechanism formed from a pivotally mounted L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used to capture the pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in the slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in a latched position as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. When the L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is rotated counter-clockwise, as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is released to allow the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to be unlatched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Normally the L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is spring loaded in a clockwise direction to force the L-shaped member into the position as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. A release cable <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) is attached to one end of the L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The release cable <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used to overcome the spring force in order to rotate the L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in a counterclockwise position as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> in order to release the pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The other end of the release cable <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may be attached to a solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). In a normal position, the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is not powered and thus does not tension the release cable <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. When electrical power is applied to the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a plunger <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> on the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is retracted to place tension on the release cable <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in order to rotate the L-shaped member <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) to enable the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to be unlatched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) may be key operated. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> key-operated switch <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> may be located on the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a key is inserted and turned to the on position, the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is powered up in order to enable the upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be released. However, use of the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> requires that the machine be connected to a source of electrical power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the event of a power failure or need to access the machine when no power is available, a portal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) may be provided on the front portion of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, adjacent the solenoid <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the portal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may be is hinged at the bottom and may be secured at the top with a simple key latch <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. During conditions when electric power is not available, the portal <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is simply opened and tension manually placed on the release cable <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to unlatch the upper latch assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In order to prevent the extended bet button <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from being disconnected from the gaming machine, a stop assembly <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is provided. The stop assembly <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> includes a bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> defining an access area which enables the cable <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to freely slide through. A generally cylindrical weight <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is attached around the armored cable <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> at a distance selected to prevent axial forces from being placed on the electrical connection to the gaming machine in an extended position. The cylindrical weight <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has a relatively larger diameter than the cable <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. In a normal position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the weight <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> rests in the interior of the lower front housing portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. When the bet button <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is in an extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the diameter of the weight <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is much larger than the access through the bracket <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> thus preventing further movement of the armored cable <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> stop as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
