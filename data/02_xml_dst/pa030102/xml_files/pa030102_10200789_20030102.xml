<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">New secondary amines are described which are prepared from inexpensive, commercially available raw materials, are stable at room temperature, and are reactive toward electrophiles. The secondary amines are prepared by the addition of one or more primary amines with one or more male (amide/ester) and fumar (amide/ester) Michael receptors. The above amines can be used as coreactants with aliphatic polyisocyanates for polyurea coatings. The novel secondary amines are also described as particularly useful as part of a two-part liquid pavement marking composition for pavement markings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to new secondary amines and their use in coatings, e.g. polyurea coatings and in a liquid pavement marking composition. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polyfunctional amines are used as coreactants with polyfunctional isocyanates in many applications. These reactions yield polyureas which are a highly regarded class of polymers, known for their toughness, high strength and dynamic mechanical and high temperature performance. These reactions are generally carried out in specialized equipment, due to the high reactivity of amines and isocyanates. This has limited their use in traditional adhesives, coatings and sealer type product applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typical primary and secondary amines are extremely reactive with a variety of electrophiles, which results in very short gel times with little or no potlife. The reaction of primary amines with isocyanates is extremely exothermic and produces strongly hydrogen bonded dihydro-urea linkages. Strongly hydrogen bonded groups may disadvantageously increase product viscosities and hinder subsequent mobility and reactivity of attached functional groups. Additionally, uncontrollable reaction rates are undesirable in many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The utility of amines of the present invention is based on the addition reaction between a polyisocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component, in particular polyamines containing secondary amino groups. This reaction is known in principle from DE-OS 2,158,945 (Fed. Rep. Of German, 1973) but according to the teachings of this publication the reaction is not used for crosslinking two-component coating compositions at relatively low temperatures but rather for the preparation of intermediate products which are converted at elevated temperatures into heterocyclic end products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Bayer Corp. has recently introduced polyaspartic acid diesters under the name DESMOPHEN&trade;. These secondary amines react more controllably with electrophiles than do the corresponding primary amines. However, the adducts of these amines and isocyanatcs are capable of a further transformation to form a hydantoin ring structure, giving rise to shrinking of the coating and generating undesired alcohol byproducts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,170 describes secondary amines, referred to as &ldquo;polyaspartic acid derivatives&rdquo;, which are formed by the Michael-type reaction of primary polyamines with maleic or fumaric acid ester Michael receptors. This reaction is illustrated below as formula (I), wherein R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are as defined in the cited reference.

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These aspartic ester diesters react with isocyanates to form urea-diester linkages.

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Urea-diester linkages are reportedly unstable however, cyclizing to the hydantoin with the concomitant expulsion of alcohol. The expelled alcohol is problematic in some systems such as isocyanate-terminated prepolymers, since it may undesirably react with residual isocyanate groups. Dimensional changes of the polymer upon hydantoin formation is a potential problem as well. This reaction is illustrated below as formula (III), wherein R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>are as defined in the cited reference.

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There is a need for improved polyurea and polyurethane coatings having amine components that resist hydantoin formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a significant need for a liquid pavement marking composition that will provide increased durability and retained reflectivity once applied to a surface and dried or cured. Furthermore, it is advantageous to apply markings in a wider range of weather conditions than is possible with existing compositions. There is also a need for marking compositions with improved cure profiles to ensure both substrate wet out and rapid track free time. Improvements are needed to obtain compositions that are substantially free of volatile organic components. Compositions of this type are typically used on roads, highways, parking lots and recreational trails to form stripes, bars and markings for the delineation of lanes, crosswalks, parking spaces, symbols and legends and the like. They are typically applied by spray coating (i.e., painting) the pavement surface. Preformed pavement marking sheets or tapes have also been used to mark pavement or traffic bearing surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Pavement marking stripes, or pavement markings of other shapes, may include reflective optical elements adhered to the pavement surface by the use of a binder. Current traffic paint systems typically use conventional 1.5n<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>glass microspheres for increased retroreflection. The microspheres are typically flood coated onto the wet marking immediately after coating. This provides the paint with improved retroreflectivity and also covers the top surface of the uncured or undried coating with a protective layer of microspheres. This protective layer allows the markings to be exposed to traffic sooner because of the layer of microspheres over the surface, which prevents transfer of the coating to the surface of vehicle tires. This is important for rates of marking application. The time between application and the point where material will no longer transfer to vehicle tires is defined as the &ldquo;track free&rdquo; time. Shorter track free times increase marking efficiency by reducing or eliminating the need for traffic disruption through such measures as closing lanes or placing traffic control devices to protect such markings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,596 discloses liquid pavement marking compositions that solve many of the problems of alkyd-based and epoxy-based pavement marking compositions. Such pavement marking compositions are prepared from a two part polyurethane-forming system of a first component having isocyanate-reactive groups (a polyol) and a second component having isocyanate groups. It is disclosed that such compositions dry faster, withstand weathering better, and do not discolor as readily as alkyd-based and epoxy-based compositions. However, the exemplified compositions required aromatic isocyanates in combination with the polyols and a catalyst. Any colorless or lightly colored aromatic polyisocyanate is suggested to increase the reactivity and decrease the viscosity of the isocyanate component and provide a harder polyurethane. Aromatic isocyanates are not particularly desirable because the resultant polyurethanes are subject to environmental degradation and discoloration. Also, many lower molecular weight aromatic isocyanates that would decrease viscosity and modify reactivity or film properties can potentially pose significant inhalation risk or toxic hazard related to their vapor pressure. Furthermore, the use of catalysts is not desirable because they can also catalyze degradation of the polyurethanes. To overcome the deficiencies of aromatic isocyanates, aliphatic isocyanates could be used with polyols; however, this would require the use of a catalyst or an aromatic isocyanate together with an aliphatic isocyanate to obtain sufficient rates of cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the need still exists for liquid pavement marking compositions that can simultaneously provide all of these features in a single material: reduced environmental impact through formulations having low volatile organic content or that are substantially solvent-free; improved balance of coating rheology during application and film formation to promote substrate wet out and fast cure to track-free films; broadened range of weather conditions for coating application; and improved marking performance through increased durability and retained reflectively. Especially needed are liquid pavement marking compositions that resist shrinkage, thus avoiding cracking, coating imperfections and failures. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The coating compositions to be used for the process according to the invention may also contain other auxiliary agents and additives conventionally used in polyurethane coatings, in particular pigments, fillers, leveling agents, catalysts, antisettling agents, antioxidants, UV stabilizers and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The properties of the coatings obtained by the process according to the invention may be adjusted, in particular by suitable choice of the nature and proportions of the starting components. Thus, for example, the presence of relatively high molecular weight, linear polyhydroxyl compounds either in the prepolymers or semi-prepolymeyers of each component increases the elasticity of the coatings; whereas, the absence of such starting components increases the crosslinking density and hardness of the resulting coatings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For carrying out the process according to the invention, the coating compositions to be used according to the invention are applied as one or more layers to substrates by known methods such as spraying, brush coating, immersion or flooding or by means of rollers or doctor applicators. The process according to the invention is suitable for the formation of coatings on any substrates, e.g., metals, plastics, wood or glass. The substrates to be coated by the process according to the invention may be treated with suitable primers before the process according to the invention is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> After the substrates exemplified above have been coated, the coatings are cured by the process according to the invention at a temperature of about &minus;20&deg; to 100&deg; C. Curing is preferably carried out at a temperature of about 10&deg; C. to 80&deg; C. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">LIQUID PAVEMENT MARKER </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a two-part liquid pavement marking containing a binder having polyurea groups, wherein the binder is prepared from a two-part coating composition having an amine component including one or more novel secondary amines of the present invention as defined above and optionally one or more amine-functional coreactants, and an isocyanate component having one or more polyisocyanates. Preferably, the pavement marking contains a binder having urea groups, wherein the binder is prepared from a two-part coating composition having an amine component with one or more secondary amines and optionally one or more amine-functional coreactants, and an isocyanate component containing one or more polyisocyanates, wherein the coating composition has a minimum application temperature of at least about 10&deg; C. and a track free time of no greater than about 5 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the binders used according to the invention, there is an equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate-reactive groups of about 0.8:1 to 20:1, preferably about 0.8:1 to 2:1, more preferably about 0.8:1 to 1.2:1 and most preferably about 1:1. The optional polyhydroxyl compound is present in the amine component in an amount such that up to 20 hydroxyl groups are present for each secondary amino, preferably the equivalent ratio of hydroxyl groups to secondary amino groups is about 10:1 to 1:10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The binders to be used according to the invention are prepared by mixing the individual components together. Preparation of the binders is carried out solvent-free or in the presence of the solvents conventionally used in polyurethane coatings. It is an advantage of the process according to the invention that the quantity of solvent used may be greatly reduced when compared with that required in known two-component systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable solvents include xylene, butyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, methoxypropyl acetate, N-methyl pyrrolidone, petroleum hydrocarbons, iso-butanol, butyl glycol, butyoxyethanol, chlorobenzenes and mixtures of such solvents. The alcoholic solvents previously mentioned may be used, provided that the optional polyhydroxyl compounds are not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The pavement marking compositions of the present invention contain a binder having urea groups. This binder is prepared from a two-part system that includes an amine compound and an isocyanate component. Preferably, the amine component includes secondary amines. More preferably, the amine component includes the secondary amine of the present invention. Most preferably, the amine component includes one or more amide-ester amines, optionally blended with one or more amine-functional coreactants other than an amide-ester amine. Preferably, the amine-functional coreactants are polymeric polyamines, and more preferably, substantially polymeric diamines. These amine-functional coreactants are selected to balance the properties of the coating during the curing process and in its final form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The amine and isocyanate components are chosen such that the resultant pavement marking is generally resistant and durable to environmental and vehicular stresses and has good daytime visibility. Preferably, it also has good night-time visibility. Durability can be evidenced by good adhesion (i.e., anchoring) to a wide variety of substrate surfaces, including concrete, asphalt, and other markings, whether they be markings of the same or different material. It can also be evidenced by good adhesion (i.e., anchoring) of reflective elements to the marking, if they are used. As used herein, &ldquo;durability&rdquo; can be determined by applying the pavement marking to a road surface that will be exposed to traffic conditions and monitoring the performance of the marking over time. Reflectivity and whiteness can be measured instrumentally in the field and the resistance of the marking to wear and erosion can be subjectively evaluated. Durable markings have continued presence on the substrate, good visibility, and, preferably, good reflectivity over an extended length of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The pavement markings formed from the composition of the present invention preferably are durable (i.e., have a useful life) for at least about two years, more preferably, for at least about three years, and most preferably, for at least about four years. If reflective elements are used, the pavement markings have a retained reflectivity of at least about 100 mcd/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/lux, and more preferably, at least about 150 mcd/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/lux, throughout its useful life. As used herein, &ldquo;retained reflectivity&rdquo; is used to describe the effectiveness of maintained retroreflective performance of a pavement marker over its useful life. Retroreflectivity is currently typically measured by an instrument in the laboratory at fixed entrance and observation angles, according to ASTM D 4061-94. Recent work (Transportation Research Record 1409 published 1994 by the Transportation Research Board) has shown that the entrance angle at which light is incident and observation angles from which a driver actually views a pavement marking, referred to herein as &ldquo;approximate driver geometries,&rdquo; are appropriate for measured retroreflective performance of pavement markings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The amine and isocyanate components are preferably chosen such that the pavement marking composition: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> (1) is a liquid with a high solids content (preferably, at least about 75 wt-%, and more preferably, at least about 90 wt-%, based on the total weight of the composition), which is substantially solvent free (preferably, less than about 5 wt-% solvent, based on the total weight of the composition); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> (2) has a rapid cure profile, with a track-free time (i.e., a dry time at ambient roadway conditions when the coating is applied) of preferably, no greater than about five minutes, more preferably no greater than about four minutes, and most preferably, no greater than about three minutes, and a useful open time (i.e., the length of time the composition will remain free flowing after application to a surface for adequate substrate wet out and particle or reflective element wicking/anchorage) preferably, an open time of at least about 30 seconds, and more preferably, at least about one minute; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (3) has a broad application window (i.e., it is able to be applied over a wide range of temperatures, with emphasis on use at lower temperatures) preferably, having a minimum application temperature of at least about 45&deg; F., more preferably, at least 40&deg; F., even more preferably, at least about 35&deg; F., and most preferably, at least about 25&deg; F.; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> (4) is compatible with two-part static mix or airless high pressure impingement-mix application equipment; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> (5) includes commercially available, low-cost raw materials; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (6) is generally storage stable preferably, having a useful shelf-life of at least six months, more preferably, at least one year, and most preferably, at least two years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Although the pavement marking compositions of the present invention are referred to as two-part systems, a number of additives may also be included. These additives include weathering additives, antioxidants, dispersion and grinding aids, wetting agents, impact modifiers, defoamers, pigments, fillers, extenders, diluents, plasticizers, leveling agents and surfactants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Pigments are well known in the pavement marking art to impart desired visual appearance properties during the daytime and contribute to the reflective properties of the marking at night. Fillers and extenders can be used to modify flow properties of the liquid coating and can contribute to the bulk volume of the final coating. Fillers may also be used to achieve a particular volume ratio without significantly affecting the reactive chemistry. The pigments, fillers and extenders can have a significant impact on uncured formulation and cured film density, film cure profile and track free time, cured film modulus, coating adhesion to a substrate, response to thermal cycling, abrasion and coating durability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TRAFFIC-BEARING SURFACES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A method of marking a traffic bearing surface is provided, which includes applying to the traffic bearing surface a two-part coating composition containing an amine component having one or more of the novel secondary amines of the present invention as defined above and optionally one or more amine-functional coreactants, and an isocyanate component containing one or more polyisocyanates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The two-part coating composition is typically applied using spray coating techniques. Typically, the two components are applied using a spray apparatus which allows mixing immediately prior to exiting from the apparatus. For example, two-component, high pressure, airless, impingement mixing systems can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> An example of an airless, impingement mixing spray system is manufactured by Gusmer. The system includes the following components: a proportioning section which meters the components and raises the pressure above about 1500 psi; a heating section to control the viscosity of each component; and an impingement spray gun which combines the two components and allows mixing just prior to atomization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Another useful system is similar to the impingement unit, except that it uses a static mix tube to achieve blending of the two components. This mix tube contains a number of flights designed to mix the components prior to atomization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the liquid pavement marking compositions provide polyurea coatings having conventional daytime visibility. They can also function as binders to anchor reflective optical elements. When the reflective elements are glass or ceramic microspheres, they are typically in the range of about 200 &mgr;m to about 600 &mgr;m and may be incorporated into the coating, or preferably, may be dropped onto the wet coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Post-spray applied elements in the form of glass or ceramic microspheres can also be used as a binder filler in addition to providing night time reflectivity. They may function similarly to mineral particulates on the wear surface. Preferably, typical coverage rates are greater than about 4 pounds of glass beads per gallon of paint, more preferably greater than 10 pounds per gallon, even more preferably greater than 25 pounds per gallon and most preferably, greater than 30 pounds per gallon. </paragraph>
