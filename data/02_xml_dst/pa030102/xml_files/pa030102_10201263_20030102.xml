<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to auditory prostheses. The invention more particularly relates to a method and a system for calibration of a sound field. The invention still more specifically relates to a method and a system to be used during fine-tuning of an auditory prosthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An auditory prosthesis, such as a hearing aid, is typically fine-tuned to an individual user by placing the user with the auditory prosthesis in an auditory test room in which various sound fields are generated from a sound source. Each of the sound fields corresponds to a sound field occurring in a real life sound environment, such as in a concert hall, in an environment with party noise, with traffic noise, with no background noise, etc, etc. It is the object of the fine-tuning procedure to adjust the auditory prosthesis in such a way that the user&apos;s hearing loss is compensated as well as possible in similar real life sound environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to perform the required auditory measurements accurately during auditory prosthesis fine-tuning, the test room and the auditory fine-tuning equipment must be calibrated to provide a predetermined sound field at the position of the user. It is well known that sound pressure in sound fields generated with equipment that is not calibrated may vary significantly. Many dispensers of hearing aids constitute rather small entities for which investment in calibration equipment represents a significant burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. The Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> EP-A-0 341 995 discloses an auditory prostheses having a microphone, a signal processor, a signal output and an output transducer. The calibration device comprises a memory for storing information characteristic of information intrinsic to the individual auditory prosthesis and representing either a sufficient set of adjustment parameters for calculation of the transfer function of the auditory prosthesis or manufacturing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> WO-A-9948323 relates to a hearing aid fitting method comprising selection of loudness levels for a plurality of frequencies and comparing each loudness level for each frequency for perceived sameness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and a system for generation of a calibrated sound field that reduces calibration equipment requirements without substantially compromising calibration accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention, in a first aspect, provides an auditory prosthesis comprising a microphone for transforming an acoustic input signal into a microphone signal, a processor with a processor output and a measuring signal output, said processor being adapted for providing at said processor output a hearing loss compensation signal and for providing at said measuring signal output a sound level signal determined on the basis of the microphone signal, and an output transducer for transforming the hearing loss compensation signal into an acoustic output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This permits use of resources already available in the auditory prosthesis for calibration of equipment used to generate the sound field corresponding to a specific sound environment for use during fine-tuning. Thus, utilisation of the auditory prosthesis for sound pressure determinations eliminates a need for dedicated sound pressure determining equipment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Hearing defects may typically vary as a function of frequency in a way that is different for each individual user. To take account of this, an advantageous embodiment of the auditory prosthesis of the invention may be provided, where the auditory prosthesis further comprises a filter bank in the signal processor connected with the microphone to receive the microphone signal therefrom, said filter bank having bandpass filters for dividing the microphone signal into a set of bandpass filtered microphone signals, wherein the signal processor is adapted to generate the processor output signal by individually processing each of the bandpass filtered microphone signals, summing the processed signals to form the processor output signal and determine sound pressures based on the set of bandpass filtered microphone signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Hereby, selective calibration of the equipment for sound field generation in each of the frequency bands of the auditory prosthesis is facilitated. Further, a need for a dedicated frequency analyser is eliminated. In the following, the frequency ranges of the bandpass filters are also denoted channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The auditory prosthesis may contain more than one microphone, e.g. for provision of directional characteristic capabilities, noise suppression capabilities, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, sound pressure is determined as a sound pressure level in accordance with an accepted standard, such as ISO 131-1979, Acoustics&mdash;Expression of physical and subjective magnitudes of sound or noise in air. The sound pressure level is the sound pressure relative to a reference pressure, typically 20 &mgr;Pa, preferably in dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, utilisation of an auditory prosthesis for sound pressure determinations eliminates a need for dedicated sound pressure determining equipment, such as a calibrated microphone with a measuring apparatus for determination of sound pressure, e.g. a sound level meter according to IEC 651-1979, Sound level meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The auditory prosthesis may comprise a memory for storing sensitivity values of the microphone. The sensitivity may be the sound pressure level sensitivity. Sensitivity is defined as the ratio of generated electronic microphone signal magnitude to applied sound pressure. The magnitude may be the amplitude, RMS-value, etc. Typically, a set of sensitivity values is stored for a set of respective frequency ranges, and the stored sensitivity values are used in the determination of sound pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The sensitivity values specified on the data sheet provided by the manufacturer of the microphone may be stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Typically, sound pressure determinations made by auditory prostheses vary 1-2 dB so that calibration of sound field generating equipment with an auditory prosthesis according to the present invention may reduce sound pressure variations, e.g. from app. 20 dB to app. 2 dB. Typically, a 2 dB sound pressure ambiguity is sufficiently accurate for the purpose of performing an optimum fine-tuning of an auditory prosthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a calibration of the microphone of the auditory prosthesis is performed for determination of sensitivity values of the microphone, and the determined sensitivity values are stored in the memory. Calibration of the sound field with an auditory prosthesis according to this embodiment is substantially as accurate as the calibration accuracy of the microphone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The invention, in a second aspect, provides a method for generation of a calibrated sound field, comprising the steps of positioning in a test space an auditory prosthesis, said auditory prostheses having a microphone, a signal processor, and an output transducer, said auditory prostheses being adapted to provide a sound level signal determined on the basis of a signal from said microphone, generating a sound field in the test space, and feeding the sound level signal to the controller in order that the controller may modify the generated sound field based on the sound level signal as appropriate to generate a calibrated sound field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the method, the step of positioning further comprises the steps of positioning the auditory prosthesis in the ear of a user situated in the test space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the auditory prosthesis is positioned in the ear of a user who is situated in the test space during sound field calibration, the need for a manikin or a test dummy, an occluded ear simulator, etc, is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The method may further comprise the step of modifying the generated sound field based on the generated set of sound pressure signals whereby a calibrated sound field is generated. Thus, in the method the step of generating a sound field may comprise the steps of providing a sound signal, modifying the sound signal according to a set of control parameters to provide a modified sound signal, and transforming the modified sound signal into a sound field in the test space. The method may further comprise the steps of supplying the set of sound pressure signals to a controller for calculation of new values of the set of control parameters for modification of the sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention, in a third aspect, provides a system for generation of a calibrated sound field, comprising a sound signal generator for generation of a sound signal, a sound signal modifier adapted to modify the sound signal in accordance with a set of control parameters for provision of a modified sound signal, a sound transducer for transforming the modified sound signal into a sound field in a test space, an auditory prosthesis, and a controller, wherein said auditory prostheses has a microphone for transforming an acoustic input signal into a microphone signal, a processor with a processor output and a measuring signal output, wherein said processor is adapted for providing at said measuring signal output a sound level signal determined on the basis of the microphone signal, and wherein said controller is adapted to receive the sound level signal and to calculate a new set of control parameters based on the sound level signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is not required to calibrate the sound field generating equipment before every fine-tuning of an auditory prosthesis to a user. Typically, it is sufficient to calibrate at regular intervals, e.g. during the first fine-tuning of a working day. However, when the sound field is calibrated with the auditory prosthesis worn by the user to whom the auditory prosthesis is subsequently fine-tuned, the additional advantage is obtained that the sound field is calibrated at the position of the auditory prosthesis during fine-tuning whereby ambiguity of sound pressure at the auditory prosthesis during fine-tuning is minimised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The auditory prosthesis may be a hearing aid that is adapted to be programmed by an external programming device and to be connected to the programming device with a programming cable. Preferably, the signal output is also adapted to be connected to the programming cable, in order that the sound level signal can be supplied to the controller via the programming cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The auditory prosthesis may further comprise a wireless communication link for reception of the set of sound pressure signals from the signal processor and for transmission of corresponding respective signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The sound signal may be generated by reproduction of a signal recorded in a storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The controller may be comprised in a personal computer comprising a memory for storage of the control parameters together with a computer programme for calculation of the control parameters, the computer further comprising input means for receiving the set of sound pressure signals.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A prior art sound field calibration system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A sound signal generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates a sound signal that is supplied to a sound signal modifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wherein the level of the sound signal is modified as a function of frequency in accordance with a set of control parameters stored in a memory, not illustrated, in the sound signal modifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The modified sound signal obtained from the signal modifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is converted by a loudspeaker <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into a sound field in a test space T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The sound field is monitored in at least one observation point within the test space T by measuring means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising a precision calibrated microphone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The measuring signal obtained from measuring means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, including level and/or frequency spectrum information, is supplied to control means comprising a signal analyser <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for derivation of data representing the sound characteristic of the sound field in the test space, from where the data are supplied to a control parameter calculator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for calculation of a new set of control parameters for use in the signal modifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sound signal generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the signal modifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the control means including the measuring signal analyser <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the control parameter calculator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> have been combined into a computing device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, such as a personal computer, comprising memory means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, such as a hard disc, a keyboard <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a display screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a sound interface that is connected with loudspeakers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for conversion of the sound signal into a sound field in the test space T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in accordance with the invention, monitoring of the sound field in the test space T is performed by a microphone positioned in a hearing aid that is carried by a user <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> who is seated in the test space T. The measuring signal obtained from one of or both of the hearing aids <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through a cable <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, preferably the programming cable <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is connected to a programming device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for programming of the hearing aid to suit various sound environments or listening situations by a computer assisted fine-tuning procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Thereby the sound field calibration of the test space T and the fine-tuning procedure may be combined into a single sequential operation using the same computer system <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the sound field calibration of the test space and for the fine-tuning procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the measuring signal obtained from the hearing aids <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is supplied to the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by wireless transmission means, such as IR or radio transmission from transmitters, not shown, integrated in each hearing aid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;, to an antenna <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connected with a receiver <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is also connected to the cable <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid possible discomfort to a user <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> during the calibration procedure, a pre-adjustment of the sound signal may be performed prior to calibration. During the pre-adjustment the hearing aid is positioned at the observation point in the test space T without being carried by the user whereby the need for adjustment of the sound signal during calibration is minimised in order to minimise possible user discomfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the simplified block diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> hearing aid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for use in the implementation of the calibration method and system according to the invention comprises at least one microphone <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> connected with a signal processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, preferably comprising programmable signal processing parts, such as bandpass filters and amplifiers, from which a processor output signal is supplied to an output transducer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as a hearing aid receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious for the person skilled in the art that the circuits shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be realised using digital or analogue circuitry or any combination hereof. In the present embodiment, digital signal processing is employed and thus, the processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises digital signal processing circuits. In the present embodiment, all the digital circuitry of the hearing aid may be provided on a single digital signal processing chip, or, the circuitry may be distributed on a plurality of integrated circuit chips in any appropriate way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the hearing aid <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also comprises interface means that is connected to the signal processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for outputting the processor output signal. The interface means may comprise a coupling terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for connection with the cable <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the interface means may comprise wireless interface means as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In a programmable hearing aid according to the present invention, a bi-directional communication link may be provided between the signal processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Thus, data may flow in both directions in signal line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. For a non-programmable hearing aid, it is sufficient to provide a unidirectional communication link between the processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for transmission of the measuring signal to the computer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for use in the calculation of calibration control parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the signal processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises a sound pressure level signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is connected to the coupling terminal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for generation of the measuring signal.
