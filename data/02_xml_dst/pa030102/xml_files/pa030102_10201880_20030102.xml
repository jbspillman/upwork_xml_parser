<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to delivery methods, systems and components thereof for use with hazardous or toxic pharmaceutical substances, and especially to delivery and injection methods, systems and components thereof for use with radiopharmaceutical substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;pharmaceutical&rdquo; refers to any substance to be injected or otherwise delivered into the body (either human or animal) in a medical procedure and includes, but is not limited, substances used in imaging procedures (for example, contrast media) and therapeutic substances. A number of such pharmaceutical substances pose a danger to both the patient and the personnel administering the substance if not handled and/or injected properly. Examples of hazardous pharmaceuticals include, but are not limited to, radiopharmaceuticals, biological pharmaceuticals, chemotherapeutic pharmaceuticals and gene therapeutic pharmaceuticals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of use of a radiopharmaceutical include positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), which are noninvasive, three-dimensional, imaging procedures that provide information regarding physiological and biochemical processes in patients. The first step in producing PET images or SPECT images of, for example, the brain or another organ, is to inject the patient with a dose of the radiopharmaceutical. The radiopharmaceutical is generally a radioactive substance that can be absorbed by certain cells in the brain or other organ, concentrating it there. For example, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a normal molecule of glucose, the basic energy fuel of cells, to which is attached a radionuclide or radioactive fluor. The radionuclide is produced in a cyclotron equipped with a unit to synthesize the FDG molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cells (for example, in the brain), which are more active in a given period of time after an injection of FDG, will absorb more FDG because they have a higher metabolism and require more energy. The radionuclide in the FDG molecule suffers a radioactive decay, emitting a positron. When a positron collides with an electron, an annihilation occurs, liberating a burst of energy in the form of two beams of gamma rays in opposite directions. The PET scanner detects the emitted gamma rays to compile a three dimensional image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In that regard, after injecting the radiopharmaceutical, the patient is typically placed on a moveable bed that slides by remote control into a circular opening of the scanner referred to as the gantry. Positioned around the opening, and inside the gantry, are several rings of radiation detectors. Each detector emits a brief pulse of light every time it is struck with a gamma ray coming from the radionuclide within the patient&apos;s body. The pulse of light is amplified, by a photomultiplier, and the information is sent to the computer that controls the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The timing of injection is very important. After the generation of the radiopharmaceutical, a countdown begins. After a certain time, which is a function of the half-life of the radionuclide, the radiation level of the radiopharmaceutical dose falls exactly to a level required for the measurement by the scanner. In current practice, the radiation level of the radiopharmaceutical volume or dose is typically measured using a dose calibrator. Using the half-life of the radionuclide, the time that the dose should be injected to provide the desired level of radioactivity to the body is calculated. When that time is reached, the radiopharmaceutical dose is injected using a manually operated syringe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Most PET radionuclides have short half-lives. Under proper injection procedures, these radionuclides can be safely administered to a patient in the form a labeled substrate, ligand, drug, antibody, neurotransmitter or other compound normally processed or used by the body (for example, glucose) that acts as a tracer of specific physiological and biological processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Excessive radiation to technologists and other personnel working in the scanner room can pose a significant risk, however. Although the half-life of the radiopharmaceutical is rather short and the applied dosages are themselves not harmful to the patient, administering personnel are exposed each time they work with the radiopharmaceuticals and other contaminated materials under current procedures. Constant and repeated exposure over an extended period of time can be harmful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A number of techniques used to reduce exposure include minimizing the time of exposure of personnel, maintaining distance between personnel and the source of radiation and shielding personnel from the source of radiation. In general, the radiopharmaceuticals are typically delivered to a nuclear medicine facility from another facility equipped with a cyclotron in, for example, a lead-shielded container. Often, the radiopharmaceutical is manually drawn from such containers into a shielded syringe. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,351 disclosing a drawing station for handling radiopharmaceuticals for use in syringes. Remote injection mechanisms can also be used to maintain distance between the operator and the radiopharmaceutical. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,071, disclosing an apparatus for remotely administering radioactive material from a lead encapsulated syringe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one procedure, the radiopharmaceutical is injected into tubing that is coiled within a lead container. Typically, the shielded syringe used to inject the radiopharmaceutical is disconnected and replaced by a larger syringe, filled in most cases with saline, for injection into the body and flush. By emptying the second syringe, the radiopharmaceutical is flushed through the shielded, coiled tubing in the container and injected into the person to be scanned. An excess volume of saline supplies a flushing function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although substantial effort is made to reduce exposure of administering and other personnel to harmful radiation, some exposure is experienced under current procedures. Being in the injection room longer than necessary is thus to be avoided. Moreover, the cumulative radiation exposure resulting from multiple injection procedures must be closely monitored to avoid overexposure. Indeed, personnel that administer radiopharmaceuticals are typically periodically rotated out of such duties to reduce the risk of overexposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition to the difficulties introduced by the hazardous nature of radiopharmaceuticals, the short half-lives of such radiopharmaceuticals further complicate the administration of a proper dosage to a patient. As discussed above, initial calibration of radioactivity is often made and the injection is then timed so that a dose of the desired level of radioactivity to the body is delivered (as calculated from the half-life of the radiopharmaceutical). See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,403 in which a motor driven syringe is controlled to inject a quantity of a radiopharmaceutical stored in the syringe by calculating the injection quantity based upon the half-life of the radiopharmaceutical and the delay before injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Radiation detectors have also been placed upon syringe shields and in line with the radiopharmaceutical delivery system. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,108 discloses a syringe loading shield for use during drawing, calibration and injection of radiopharmaceuticals. The syringe shield includes a radiation detector for detecting and calibrating the radioactive dosage of the radiopharmaceutical drawn into the syringe. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,562,829 and 4,585,009 disclose strontium-rubidium infusion systems and a dosimetry system for use therein. The infusion system includes a generator of the strontium-rubidium radiopharmaceutical in fluid connection with syringe for supplying pressurized saline. Saline pumped through the strontium-rubidium generator exits the generator either to the patient or to waste collection. Tubing in line between the generator and the patient passes in front of a dosimetry probe to count the number of disintegrations that occur. As the flow rate through the tubing is known, it is possible to measure the total activity delivered to the patient (for example, in milliCuries). Likewise, radiation measurements have been made upon blood flowing through the patient. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,966 discloses shunting of blood flow from a patient through a radiation detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The danger to administering personnel and other difficulties that arise from the nature of hazardous pharmaceuticals such as radiopharmaceuticals often affect the quality and safety of the injection procedure. For example, given the care that must be taken to prevent radiation overexposure (including limiting the duration of injection procedures), the concern with properly timing an injection and the need to prevent the creation of radioactive wastes, it is often difficult to properly eliminate air from all fluid paths before an injection begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is thus very desirable to develop devices, systems and methods through which toxic or hazardous pharmaceuticals (for example, radiopharmaceuticals) can be administered in controlled manner to enhance their effectiveness and patient safety, while reducing exposure of administering personnel to such hazardous pharmaceuticals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of injecting a hazardous pharmaceutical comprising the steps of: connecting a source of flushing fluid to a first port of a fluid delivery set; connecting a pressurizing unit of a powered injector system (including a powered injector and the pressurizing unit) to a second port of the fluid delivery set; purging air from the fluid delivery set; and, after purging air from the fluid delivery set, connecting a third port of the fluid delivery set to a source of the hazardous pharmaceutical. The fluid delivery set can, for example, include a valve system or assembly to control flow of fluid through the fluid delivery set. The ports of the fluid delivery set can, for example, include luer connectors as known in the medical arts to form a removable, secure and generally sealed connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The method preferably further includes the steps of (i) removably connecting a disposable fluid path that is connectable (via, for example, a catheter) to a patient to the fluid delivery set and (ii) purging air from the disposable fluid path before connecting the fluid delivery set to the source of hazardous pharmaceutical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By removing air from the fluid delivery set and the patient fluid path before any connection is made to the source of hazardous pharmaceutical, exposure of administering personnel to the hazardous pharmaceutical to that point is eliminated. Connecting the fluid delivery set to the source of pharmaceutical can be automated or otherwise accomplished remotely (for example, with use of an extending or robotic arm as known in the machine and robotic arts) to prevent exposure during that connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pressurizing unit can, for example, be a syringe in operative connection with the powered injector. In the case that the pressurizing unit is a syringe, the method can further include the steps of drawing the hazardous pharmaceutical into the syringe and injecting the hazardous pharmaceutical through the fluid delivery set and the disposable fluid path. Using a powered injector having a control unit removed in distance or shielded from the position of the syringe, fluid delivery set and fluid path prevents exposure of operating/administering personnel to the hazardous pharmaceutical. The method preferably further includes the step of flushing the fluid delivery set and the disposable fluid path after injection using the flushing fluid (for example, saline and/or another biologically acceptable flushing agent). A powered injector can also be used with a saline syringe in a similar manner as described above to limit exposure of operating personnel to the hazardous pharmaceutical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case that the hazardous pharmaceutical is a radiopharmaceutical, the method can further include the step of measuring the level or dosage of radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical injected. Preferably, the level of radioactivity or dosage is measured very near in time or simultaneously with delivery of the radiopharmaceutical to provide an accurate measurement of the dosage delivered. For example, the level of radioactivity can be measured by positioning the syringe within a dose calibrator. The level of radioactivity can also be measured by placing a radioactivity detector in operative connection with a line through which the radiopharmaceutical is dispensed or delivered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a system for delivery of a hazardous pharmaceutical including: a syringe in operative connection with a powered injector and a protective container to enclose the syringe during operation thereof. The protective container is constructed or adapted to protect personnel from detrimental effects of the pharmaceutical. The system preferably also includes at least one source of flushing fluid; a fluid path adapted to connect to a patient; at least one source of the pharmaceutical; and a fluid delivery set. The fluid delivery set preferably includes a valve assembly to which the syringe, the source of flushing fluid, the fluid path and the source of pharmaceutical are removably connectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The valve assembly preferably provides flow control through the fluid delivery set such that operator contact with the fluid delivery set is not required after connection of the source of pharmaceutical to the fluid delivery set. The valve assembly also preferably provides flow control through the fluid delivery set such that the entire fluid delivery set can be purged of air with the syringe and the source of flushing fluid in fluid connection with the valve assembly before the source of pharmaceutical is connected to the fluid delivery set. In one embodiment, the valve assembly includes a bypass line in continuous fluid connection between the source of flushing fluid and the fluid path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the case that the pharmaceutical is a radiopharmaceutical, the protective container can, for example, be a component of a dose calibrator adapted to measure the level of radioactivity of the pharmaceutical within the syringe. In one embodiment, the syringe is connected to the powered injector via an extending adapter that preferably extends from the powered injector when connected thereto to position the syringe within the protective container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The adapter can, for example, include an injector attachment member to attach the adapter to a powered injector and a plunger extension fixed in position relative to a powered injector. The plunger extension preferably has a plunger attachment member to attach to a plunger of the syringe. In one embodiment, the adapter also includes a syringe carriage slidably attached to the adapter. The syringe carriage includes a syringe attachment member to removably attach a syringe thereto so that a barrel of a syringe can be moved relative to a plunger thereof to control fluid flow into and out of a syringe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The above embodiment of an adapter facilitates orientation of the syringe tip or exit of the syringe directed toward the powered injector when the syringe is attached to the syringe attachment member. This orientation can facilitate purging of air from the syringe when the syringe is placed within, for example, a dose calibrator positioned below the injector. In that regard, lead-shielded dose calibrators are often relatively large and heavy and thus positioned most easily near the floor. Moreover, this relative positioning of the injector and dose calibrator assists in limiting exposure of operating/administering personnel by directing any waves of radiation escaping from the dose calibrator upward to the ceiling of the room. Moving the syringe barrel relative to the syringe plunger in the manner described in the above embodiment facilitates use of commercially available injectors and syringes for use therewith by eliminating the need to change/recalibrate the direction and distance the injector drive member must advance or retract to complete a desired operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of using a powered injector system to inject a radiopharmaceutical into a body. The method includes the steps of: attaching an extending adapter to the front end of the powered injector; the adapter including an injector attachment to place the adapter in operative connection with the powered injector, the adapter also including a syringe attachment to attach a syringe to the adapter to place the syringe in operative connection with the powered injector; and extending the adapter into a radiation shield. As discussed above, the radiation shield can form part of a dose calibrator to measure the radioactivity of radiopharmaceutical within the syringe. In one embodiment, the exit of the syringe is oriented upward relative to the opposite end of the syringe when the syringe is positioned within the dose calibrator to facilitate purging of air from the syringe. As discussed above, the opening through which the syringe passed to enter the dose calibrator is preferably oriented in a direction (for example, upward toward the ceiling) to decrease the likelihood of exposure of personnel to any radiation waves exiting the dose calibrator during use thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention provides an adapter for use with a powered injector to attach a syringe to the powered injector including: an injector attachment member to attach the adapter to a powered injector and a syringe attachment member spaced from the injector attachment member by a sufficient distance to position a syringe attached to the syringe attachment member within a radiation dose calibrator. Preferably, the adapter facilitates use of commercially available injector systems with commercially available dose calibrators without the requirement of substantial and/or expensive modification thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides an adapter for use with a powered injector to attach a syringe to the powered injector including an injector attachment member to attach the adapter to a powered injector and a plunger extension fixed in position relative to a powered injector. The plunger extension has a plunger attachment member to attach to a plunger of the syringe. The adapter further includes a syringe carriage slidably attached to the adapter and including a syringe attachment member to removably attach a syringe thereto so that a barrel of the syringe can be moved relative to a plunger thereof to control fluid flow into and out of the syringe. As discussed above, the syringe can be oriented with a syringe tip thereof directed toward the powered injector when attached to the syringe attachment member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, an adapter includes an attachment member to removably attach the adapter to a powered injector and a syringe carriage slidably attached to the attachment member. The syringe carriage includes a syringe attachment member to which a syringe can be removably attached. The adapter further includes an end member attached a fixed distance from the attachment member. The end member has a plunger extension attached to the end member and extending toward the injector. The plunger extension includes a plunger attachment member on an end thereof opposite the end attached to the end member. The syringe carriage is adapted to move a barrel of the syringe relative to a plunger of the syringe when a syringe is attached to the syringe attachment member and a plunger thereof is attached to the plunger extension member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a shield for use with a radiopharmaceutical including a housing that is impenetrable by radioactive energy from the radiopharmaceutical. The shield also includes at least one opening in the housing through which an article containing the radiopharmaceutical, which is positioned within the housing, can be viewed. The opening is in visual alignment with a reflective surface in which a viewer can view a reflection of the article. The opening is positioned within the housing such that there is no direct line between the viewer and the article that is not shielded by a portion of the housing. Because radiation energy from radiopharmaceuticals travels in straight lines, the viewer is shielded from exposure to radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of injecting a radiopharmaceutical into a body. The method includes the steps of: positioning a pressurizing unit or device containing a first volume of the radiopharmaceutical within a dose calibrating unit adapted to measure the level of radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical; and injecting a second volume of the radiopharmaceutical. The second volume is determined through measurement by the dose calibrating unit to provide a desired level of radioactivity. The second volume can, for example, be less than the first volume. In one embodiment, the pressurizing chamber is a syringe in fluid connection with a powered injector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention provides a kit for injecting a hazardous pharmaceutical into a body including: a fluid path adapted to connect to a patient; and a fluid delivery set. The fluid delivery set includes a valve assembly to which a pressurizing unit, a source of flushing fluid, the fluid path and a source of the pharmaceutical are removably connectable. The valve assembly provides flow control through the fluid delivery set such that operator contact with the fluid delivery set is not required after connection of the source of pharmaceutical to the fluid delivery set. The valve assembly also preferably provides flow control through the fluid delivery set such that the entire fluid delivery set can be purged of air with the syringe and the source of saline in fluid connection with the valve assembly before the source of pharmaceutical is connected to the fluid delivery set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of injecting a radiopharmaceutical into a patient. The method comprises the steps of: connecting a powered pressurizing device that is controlled without intimate or close contact by an operator (for example, remotely controlled, automated or preprogrammed so that the operator is not within a radiation field of a dangerous level) to a valve assembly of a fluid delivery set; connecting at least one source of a flushing fluid to the valve assembly; connecting a patient fluid path to the valve assembly, the patient fluid path terminating in a patient connector; connecting a source of a ready-made (that is, prepared earlier&mdash;for example, in an offsite cyclotron) radiopharmaceutical to the valve assembly; and controlling the valve assembly at least during injection of the hazardous pharmaceutical such that operator presence in the vicinity of the radiopharmaceutical is not required. In general, a dose to an individual decreases with the square of the distance from the radiation source. Thus, close operator contact with the pressurizing device, fluid delivery set and other components of the fluid delivery system is not required when the radiopharmaceutical is present in the fluid delivery system. Moreover, shielding as described above can also be used to prevent exposure. The valve assembly can also be controlled without intimate contact by an operator (for example, remotely controlled, automated or preprogrammed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention provides for administration or delivery of a toxic or hazardous pharmaceuticals (for example, radiopharmaceuticals) in controlled manner to enhance the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical and to enhance patient safety (as compared to current procedures and equipment for delivering such pharmaceuticals), while reducing exposure of administering personnel to the hazardous pharmaceuticals. In general, commercially available injector systems are readily adaptable for use in the present invention without substantial or expensive modification.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, in one embodiment of the present invention, a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a fluid delivery set or system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> including a valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that provides a fluid connection for a saline source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (for example, a syringe), a source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a pharmaceutical to be injected into a patient, a pressurizing chamber or unit for the pharmaceutical (for example, a syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in fluid connection with a powered injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is connectable to the patient (via, for example, tubing terminating in a catheter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). In general, the fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and other elements of the present invention enable purging of air from the system, filling of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the pharmaceutical, delivery of the pharmaceutical (for example, injecting the pharmaceutical into the patient) via syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and providing a saline flush, while minimizing or eliminating exposure of administering or operating personnel to the detrimental effects of the pharmaceutical and minimizing or eliminating creation of contaminated waste. Moreover, fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and other elements of the present invention also facilitate safe delivery of the pharmaceutical to multiple destinations (for example, injection into a series patients). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a three-way stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> including a first port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is in fluid connection with saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A second port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in fluid connection with source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a toxic or hazardous pharmaceutical (for example, a radiopharmaceutical). Source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the pharmaceutical is preferably enclosed within a container <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is designed to reduce the risk of contamination of personnel administering the pharmaceutical. For example, in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, the container can be fabricated from lead or tungsten to substantially prevent exposure of such personnel to undesirably high levels of radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A third port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in fluid connection with, for example, a dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The flow through stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is controlled via control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A first port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in fluid connection with syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is preferably in operative connection with powered injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A second port <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably in fluid connection with patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that includes, for example, flexible tubing <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> connected to catheter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Preferably, patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is disposable on a per patient basis to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination when system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used for injection of fluids into multiple patients. Patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably in fluid connection with second port <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via a one-way check valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to further reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferably, saline source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also in fluid connection with fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via bypass tubing or conduit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to provide, for example, flush and KVO (keep vein open) functions on demand without having to adjust control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> tee <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is positioned between saline source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A side port <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of tee <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is in fluid connection with bypass tubing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Bypass tubing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably in fluid connection with check valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (and thereby with fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) via a one-way check valve <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In injection procedures and other fluid delivery operations in which non-hazardous pharmaceuticals are delivered, purging air from the entire fluid path (including, the fluid path between a source of the pharmaceutical and the delivery point) typically includes the forcing an amount of the pharmaceutical through the fluid path to, for example, a waste receptor before beginning the procedure (for example, before insertion of a catheter into the patient). However, in the case of a hazardous pharmaceutical such as a radiopharmaceutical, it is very desirable to minimize or eliminate the creation of waste pharmaceutical. Moreover, as discussed above, it is also preferable in the case of a hazardous pharmaceutical to minimize exposure of administering personnel to the pharmaceutical. The present invention thus preferably enables purging of air from the entirety of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (and preferably, also from patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) before connection of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this manner, exposure of administering personnel to hazardous materials during purging is eliminated and no hazardous waste is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After connecting fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is fluid filled and purged of air, to pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, air can be introduced into fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, precautions are preferably taken as known in the art to reduce the likelihood of introduction of air into system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a bubble detector <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be placed in communication with line <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to detect if air is drawn from pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Examples of a bubble detector suitable for use in the present invention include the BDF/BDP series ultrasonic air bubble detectors available from Introtek of Edgewood, N.Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case that it is desirable to purge system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (for example, in the case that air is found in one of the fluid path lines), a waste container <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> (which is preferably shielded) is preferably provided. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, waste container <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is in fluid connection with a control valve <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> (similar in operation to control valve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) which is in line just before check valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Control valve <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> can be controlled remotely or automated to reduce likelihood of exposure of operating personnel to the toxic pharmaceutical. It is also possible, for example, to provide valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with control in a manner known to those skilled in art such that fluid can be purged back to source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In general, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is purged using syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and/or saline source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> During operation of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (which can be a hand syringe or a syringe powered by an injector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is first filled with saline. Saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then connected to valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via first port <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on three-way stopcock <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably used to purge air from system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also provides a flush to patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> after injection of pharmaceutical(s) to ensure that substantially all the pharmaceutical is injected into the patient and to ensure that very little if any of the toxic or hazardous pharmaceutical remains, for example, within fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is attached to injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In the case of injection of a radiopharmaceutical, at least syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is preferably enclosed within a shielded container during an injection procedure. In one embodiment, the shielded container is a radiation dose calibration unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as discussed in further detail below. Air is first preferably expelled from syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by advancing plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> toward syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is then connected to dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via first port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is connected to valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via one-way check valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is adjusted to place saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in fluid connection with tubing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Tubing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can, for example, terminate in a spike <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or other connection member to cooperate with a septum <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (for example, a bottle) as known in the art. A small volume of saline is injected or expelled from saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to purge air from tubing <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and spike <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is then adjusted to place saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in fluid connection with dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A small volume of saline is expelled to purge flush bypass line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of air. Dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides sufficient resistance to flow such that saline expelled from saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes through bypass line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> rather than through dual check valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is used to retract plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to draw saline from saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is then used to expel air in line between syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and catheter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by expelling (via advancement of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) the saline therefrom. At this point, all lines of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are free of air and filled with saline. Syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is substantially empty except for a small amount of saline not expelled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At this point, injector syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned within dose calibrating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or other radiation containment device in the case of injection of a radiopharmaceutical. Container <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is opened and pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is spiked to place source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in fluid connection with valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Spiking of pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be done automatically, remotely or robotically to reduce or prevent exposure of operating personnel. The patient is then connected to patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via catheter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is now ready for an injection. The pharmaceutical is drawn into syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by retraction of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> relative to syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and then injected into the patient by advancement of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> relative to syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Saline is then expelled from saline syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, passing through bypass line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, to flush the pharmaceutical from patient fluid path set <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. All of these functions are accomplished with little on no exposure of the operator or administering personnel to radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In that regard, all adjustments of control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> were made before the radiopharmaceutical was drawn into fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Control <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can also be adjusted remotely or automatically (for example, via electronic/computer control) in, for example, cases when some pharmaceutical is within fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (for example, in a second or subsequent procedure in a case in which fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used for multiple deliveries/injections) to prevent exposure of administering personnel. Other types of valve systems or assemblies, for example, a manifold system, can be used to affect the control of valve assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is preferably disposable after one or more uses to, for example, reduce the risk of cross-contamination between patients. Fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, including valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and/or other components of system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be placed within a protective containment unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> during use thereof to further shield personnel from radiation that may emanate from, for example, valve system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of protective containment unit or shielded container <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the present invention. In general, radioactive rays emanate in straight lines from a radiation source. Containment unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides a view of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> without providing a straight line of sight between the viewer and fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In that regard, it is often desirable for administering personnel to have a view of tubing in a fluid path to, for example, provide visual assurance of the absence of air bubbles. Containment unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a shielded housing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> having a view port <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Radioactive rays cannot escape through view port <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, as there is no line of sight (that is, unobstructed line) between view port <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Containment unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a mirrored surface <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to provide a view of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of a containment unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>a in which a view of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided by mirrored surface <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, which is in alignment with fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via view port <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. One or more additional mirrored surfaces <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> can be provided to give further views of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In each of containment units <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>one or more mirrored surfaces are used to provide a view of fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> without creating an unshielded direct line between the viewer and the fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (or other radioactive source). There is no need to provide a transparent shield (for example, lead shielded glass) over view ports <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> because the lack of an unshielded direct line of sight between the viewer and fluid delivery set <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> prevents exposure to radiation. Elimination of leaded glass can be advantageous as such glass is often expensive and heavy and can sometimes diminish or degrade a view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the case of injection of a radiopharmaceutical, positioning a pressurizing unit or chamber such as syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within dose calibrating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> such as the Capintec CRC-15PET dose calibrator available from Capintec, Inc. of Ramsey, N.J., which measures the total radiation of the volume of radiopharmaceutical enclosed within the pressurizing chamber, shields administering personnel from radiation and enables delivery of a known volume of the radiopharmaceutical having a known radiation level (as measured directly by dose calibrating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>). The accurate control of injection volume and flow rate provided by powered injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> enables automatic injection of a calculated volume of fluid (using for example processing unit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) that will provide the level of radiation necessary, for example, for a PET or SPECT image given the measured radiation of the total volume of radiopharmaceutical contained within syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provided by dose calibration unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is no longer necessary to calculate and wait for the precise moment in time when radioactive decay has brought the level of radiation of a volume of radiopharmaceutical to the desired level, thereby saving time and reducing the complexity of the injection procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C illustrate one embodiment of a setup for system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described above. In this embodiment, a PULSAR injector available from Medrad, Inc. of Indianola, Pa. was used. Injection head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> was separated from control unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/167,309, filed Nov. 24, 1999, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/721,427, filed Nov. 22, 2000 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/826,430, filed Apr. 3, 2001, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Injection head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is slidably positioned in general alignment with an opening <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in dose calibration unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on a generally vertical slide bar or stand <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> via a clamping extension <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also includes a first remote control unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for communicating data/instructions such as injection volume and flow rate into control unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> remotely (via, for example, communication line <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>). Further, injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a second remote control unit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> for remote manual control of drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The function of first remote control unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and second control unit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can be combined. On currently available PULSAR injectors, manual controls for drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> are positioned upon injector head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. However, to prevent undesirable exposure to radiation in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, such controls are preferably also positioned remotely from injector head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Saline source/syringe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be controlled via injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through a second injector head (not shown) as described, for example, in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/167,309, filed Nov. 24, 1999, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/721,427, filed Nov. 22, 2000 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/826,430, filed Apr. 3, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 4C</cross-reference>, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned upon a cabinet stand <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Slide bar <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically from cabinet stand <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Cabinet stand <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a passage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> formed therein through which syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can pass to enter dose calibration unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Cabinet stand <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a second passage <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through which pharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can pass to be deposited within container <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A cap <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> can be provided to seal container <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A through 4C</cross-reference>, first passage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is preferably oriented such that radiation emanating therefrom is directed generally vertically toward the ceiling (or in another suitable direction) to reduce the likelihood that personnel within the room of the injection procedure will be exposed to such radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Injector head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is oriented in a generally vertical, downward direction on slide bar <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to position syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within dose calibrating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. To ensure that air is purged from a syringe, however, injector heads are typically positioned such that the exit, or tip, of the syringe is oriented upward during purging. As air is less dense than other injection media and saline flushes, the air rises to the syringe tip or exit and is readily purged by, for example, forcing a small amount of fluid from the syringe. To enable a generally vertical orientation of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> oriented upward in the present invention, a syringe adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> was used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Syringe adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> attaches to injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in preferably the same manner as syringes are attached thereto. Attachment adapters can be used as known in the art to facilitate such attachment. Adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can, for example, be removably attached to injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via flanges <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> on an attachment member <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that cooperate with retaining slots in injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (not shown) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,858, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a drive extension <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> that removably connects to drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via an attachment member <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> that can, for example, include capture members that cooperate with a drive member flange <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>&prime;. Drive extension <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> attaches to a syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> at an upper plate member <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> of syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed upon adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> via slide bars <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that extend from the rear surface of attachment member <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to a fixed, lower base <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. Syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> includes a syringe attachment member <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> attached to a lower plate member <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> of syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Upper plate member <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and lower plate member <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> are connected via connecting members <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> (for example, metal or plastic bars). Syringe attachment member <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> can include slots (not shown) that cooperate with flanges <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on a rear portion of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to removably attach syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</cross-reference> (as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,858). Via syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the barrel of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slidable in an upward and downward direction on adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> further includes a plunger extension <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> that includes a plunger attachment including, for example, a flange <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> that cooperates with capture members <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> on the rear of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to removably connect plunger extension <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> to plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Adapters as known in the art can facilitate connection of plunger extension <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> to various plungers. Plunger extension <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> maintains plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in a fixed position relative to base <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and injector head <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. By upward and downward movement of syringe carriage <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> (via injector drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and drive extension <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>), the position of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> within syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is changed. For example, advancing drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> causes the barrel of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to move downward and causes a corresponding or relative advancement of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> toward syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, thereby causing fluid to be expelled from syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Upward movement (or retraction) of drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> causes the barrel of syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to move upward and corresponds to retraction of plunger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> relative to syringe tip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, thereby drawing fluid into syringe <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An extending syringe adapter, such as adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, enables use of commercially available injector systems and commercially available dose calibrators in the system of the present invention without substantial modification. The use of adapter <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is transparent to the injector control software/hardware as no change and/or recalibration of the controlled movement of drive member <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of injector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</cross-reference> illustrate several other embodiments of the present invention for providing dose calibration generally in real time. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, a</cross-reference> pressurizing device <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (for example, a syringe in communication with a powered injector) and a radiopharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> are positioned within a dose calibrator <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, radiopharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is placed in a dose calibrator <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime;, while pressurizing device <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is placed in a shielded enclosure <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</cross-reference>, radiation level detectors are placed in operative connection with flow lines (for example, tubing). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C, a</cross-reference> radiation detector <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is placed in line between radiopharmaceutical source <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> (enclosed within a shielded container <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight>) and pressurizing device <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (enclosed within a shielded container <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D, a</cross-reference> radiation detector <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>&prime; is placed in line with the exit of pressurizing device <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In general, the flow rate through the line in operative connection with radiation detector <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>&prime; is known. The radiation level of a particular dose is thus easily measured using radiation detectors <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
