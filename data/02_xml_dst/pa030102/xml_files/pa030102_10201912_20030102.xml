<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A brass coated metallic wire for use as a reinforcing component in an elastomeric article, such as a motor vehicle tire. The brass coating is formed by depositing alternate layers of copper and zinc on the wire and then drawing the wire under conditions of temperature and pressure suitable to alloy the copper and zinc to form a brass coating on the wire. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to metal wire particularly adapted for drawing to form a brass surface coating thereon, a resulting brass-coated metal wire adapted for use in wire reinforced elastomeric articles, such as vehicle tires, hoses, conveyor belts, a wire-reinforced elastomeric article containing this wire, and a method for producing the brass coated metal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In various applications, such as hoses, cables, and especially tires for motor vehicles, it is known to use metal wires as reinforcement components of the article. Particularly in tires, this reinforcement is achieved by embedding coated metallic wires in the elastomeric compound material of the tire, especially when the elastomeric compound material is used in the belts and carcass of the tire. The wires have a coating to improve the adhesion of the wire to the elastomeric compound material of the tire, and to inhibit corrosion of the metal wire. The metal wire can corrode if it enters in contact with the atmosphere, for example due to damage to the elastomeric compound material, and the corrosion can spread along the wire to other portions of the tire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in this regard, it is known to coat steel wires with brass of the composition, in weight percent, about 70 copper and 30 zinc. The most widely used practice is to sequentially deposit coatings of copper and zinc and then heat the wire so coated for a suitable time at a proper temperature to diffuse the copper and zinc sufficiently and form the desired brass coating. In another approach the coatings are formed by co-deposition using, for example, a cyanide bath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This prior-art practice has the disadvantage of requiring an excessive number of manufacturing steps. For example, it is necessary after the plurality of deposition steps and the diffusion step to pickle the resulting brass coating in an acid solution to remove the zinc oxide formed at the relatively high temperatures and long times necessary to achieve the required diffusion, and to insure a slight phosphorization of the wire which facilitates the subsequent drawing of the coated wire to reduce the coated wire to the desired dimensions. The diffusion step, which is typically conducted at temperatures within the range of about 450 to 500&deg; C., may cause a reduction in the tensile strength of the coated steel wire. The reduction can be of as much as 5% of the original tensile strength of the material. This tensile strength reduction impairs the effectiveness of the wire when used in the intended reinforcing application, particularly when used as a reinforcing component in motor vehicle tires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art that a strong bond between metal wires and rubber can be obtained if the metal wire is coated with a layer of brass, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,477. Various methods have been developed to form a coating on a metal wire. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,226,918 discloses a ferrous wire having a homogeneous coating of nickel and copper. The wire is drawn, then is thermally softened, and is pickled before entering an electrolytic bath of copper and zinc cyanide. After the homogeneous coating is deposited, the coated wire is drawn to the desired dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,828,000 discloses a steel substrate with a brass covering layer to enhance adhesion to the rubber, wherein the covering layer has on its surface a ratio Cu/(Cu&plus;Zn) of no more than 0.2. The reduction of copper percentage at the surface is obtained by heating the coated metal in an inert atmosphere to a temperature of between 250&deg; C. and 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a coated metal wire is produced that provides significant advantages over prior art products of this type, particularly when employed as a reinforcing component in an elastomeric compound material of the type used in the construction of motor vehicle tires. The elastomeric compound material may be an elastomer of either natural or synthetic origin having rubber-like characteristics, comprising fillers such as carbon black and silica are added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the production of the brass-coated wire in accordance with the invention, was found that diffusion of deposited copper and zinc layers to form the desired alloy coating of brass results during the wire-drawing operation, after deposition of these copper and zinc coatings. Although electro-deposition is preferred for depositing these layers, other known practices including chemical vapor deposition may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It has been determined that in the vulcanization operation used in tire manufacture and during which the brass coating of the wire is adhered to the elastomeric compound material, maximum effectiveness of adhesion is obtained when the copper content of the brass coating is relatively high at the outer surface of the coating, contacting the elastomeric compound material. In fact, the outer portion of the coating that actually bonds with the elastomeric compound material, also referred to as the reaction surface, is only approximately 20 nanometers thick. The adhesive reaction between the brass and elastomeric compound material results during vulcanization by the formation of chemical bonding therebetween by disulfide bond formation. This reaction is improved and promoted by the copper of the brass alloy, because copper reacts more rapidly than zinc with the elastomeric compound material. Consequently, the bonding is facilitated by increasing the concentration of copper at the reaction surface of the brass coating. To obtain optimum adhesion, the concentration of copper at the reaction surface can be controlled according to the invention to match the characteristics of the elastomeric compound material being used, by selecting a composition and thickness of the most external deposited layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, with the relative amounts of copper and zinc in accordance with the ranges of the invention, the drawability of the coated wire is improved. Specifically, this results when the crystallographic structure of substantially all of the brass coating is the face centered cubic alpha phase with only minor amounts and preferably trace amounts of the body centered cubic beta phase. It has been determined that the face centered cubic alpha phase is significantly more deformable than the body centered cubic beta phase, and thus the predominance of this former phase facilitates the wire drawing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a metal wire, which is particularly adapted for drawing to form a brass surface coating thereon, is provided with at least three alternate alloying layers, each being of copper or zinc. The most external of these layers is, however, of copper. Preferably, the most internal of the at least three layers is also of copper. The wire onto which these layers are deposited is preferably steel. The number of alternate alloying layers is preferably within the range of 3 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The alloying layers, in combination, may consist essentially of, in weight percent, about 60 to 72 copper and balance zinc, preferably about 70 copper and about 30 zinc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The metal wire may have a diameter of about 0.8 to 3.0 mm with the alloying layers in combination having a thickness of about 0.75 to 4.0 microns. The thickness of the most external layer of copper is preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 microns. Preferably, the thickness of the most external copper layer could be selected to obtain a desired copper concentration on an outer surface of the coated metal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The brass coating on the drawn wire preferably has a copper content of the outer surface greater than a copper content of any remaining portion of the brass coating. The brass coating preferably consists essentially of, in weight percent, about 60 to 72 copper and balance zinc, more preferably about 70 copper and about 30 zinc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The drawn wire preferably has a diameter of about 0.12 to 0.8 mm, with the brass coating having a thickness of about 0.1 to 0.3 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The brass coated wire, in accordance with the invention, may be contained as a reinforcing element within an elastomeric article, such as a motor vehicle tire. The brass coating is chemically bonded to the elastomeric article by disulfide bonds formed between the brass coating and the composition of the elastomeric article. The elastomer of the compound material may be of either natural or synthetic origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the method of the invention, a brass coated metal wire is produced by depositing on a metal wire at least three alternate alloying layers each being one of copper or zinc. The most external and most internal of the layers are copper., This coated wire is then subjected to a drawing operation which produces high temperature and pressure to alloy the copper and zinc layers and form the desired brass layer. The metal of the wire is preferably steel and the number, composition and thickness of the deposited layers are as set forth above. These alloying layers may be deposited by electro-deposition.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When more than three layers are deposited on the metal wire, the deposition steps described for the second and third layer are repeated. A copper layer is always deposited as the outermost layer, to provide a greater copper concentration near the outer surface of the brass coating for the metal wire. The outermost layer is preferentially copper, because it improves bonding of the wire with the elastomeric compound, as described above, and because an outer zinc layer tends to more rapidly wear the die of the drawing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferential embodiments of the present invention include deposition of three or five layers as described above. Seven or more layers may also be deposited, however the electro-deposition steps become considerably more complicated as the number of layers increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The drawing operation reduces the diameter of the metal wire coated with copper and zinc layers. The diameter reduction can be, for example, from a starting diameter of approximately 0.8 to 3.0 mm to a final diameter of approximately 0.12 to 0.8 mm. The starting alloying layers in combination having a thickness of about 0.75 to 4.0 microns, and after the drawing operation the brass coating having a thickness of about 0.1 to 0.3 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the most external layer of copper is preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 microns. The thickness of the most external copper layer could be selected to obtain a desired copper concentration on an outer surface of the coated metal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The plated wire is drawn to the final diameter by a drawing machine having a plurality of die passages, for example, 19 or 20, in order to obtain a reduction of the wire section between 10% and 12% through each die passage. The speed of the wire at the output of the die is between 16 and 20 m/s. The angle between the wire and the die is about between 8&deg; and 12&deg; . A water emulsion of lubricant (of the type well known to one skilled in the art) is used to reduce friction and cool the system. The pressure acting on the wire and coating in the die is approximately 1000 to 1500 MPa, as computed from the drawing force and the surface area of the die. The mean value of temperature to which the wire is subjected is approximately 150 Deg. C., calculated from the wire speed and other parameters. However, peak values of temperature in the die may be much higher and can reach hundreds of degrees Celsius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The efficiency of the system is measured by counting the number of breakages occurring, and by measuring the amount of brass loss during drawing. Generally, a normal brass loss is about 5%-18% by weight from the starting amount. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that sample BL2R80, which only has two layers, the innermost layer being of copper and the outermost layer of zinc, has shown an inferior performance compared to the other samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The crystallographic phases of interest that are present in the alloy are the &agr; phase, the &bgr; phase and the &ggr; phase. The drawn brass coating, according to the present invention, is characterized by a face centered cubic alpha (&agr;) phase structure with only trace amounts of the body centered cubic gamma (&ggr;) and beta (&bgr;) phases, which are difficult to deform in contrast to the easy deformability of the face centered cubic alpha phase. The presence of only alpha phase in the brass alloy, with only traces of the beta and gamma phases, results in good drawing characteristics of the brass coated metal wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> One technique used to evaluate the drawn brass coated wire is Auger spectroscopy. This technique gives the atomic concentration profile for the elements present in the coating. In the coating obtained according to one embodiment of the invention, the elements present were zinc, copper, iron, and oxygen. In particular, the average concentration of copper and zinc at the surface of the coating is related to the expected reactivity between the cords and the elastomeric compound material. The greater the copper concentration, the greater the reactivity. The concentration profile of the elements present in one of the samples of drawn coating is shown in the Auger spectrographic analysis presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this figure, the y-axis represents the atomic concentration profile of specific elements with respect to the total concentration, and the x-axis represents the sputtering time (in minutes) corresponding to the time during which the wire was exposed to Argon ions bombardment. The sputtering time is proportional to the penetration of Argon ions in the alloy, and therefore indicates the depth from the surface of the wire where the analysis takes place. We can see in this figure that in a small portion near the surface of the wire, near t&equals;0, there is a large number of oxides, due to the oxidation by contact with air. At a later time, corresponding to layers deeper within the wire, it is possible to see that the concentration of copper is high near the surface and is decreasing in a continuous way as we move deeper in the wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Once the wire is drawn, and the brass coating is formed, the drawn coated wire is used to form cords suitable for reinforcing the elastomeric compound material. The brass plated wires may be stranded to obtain various cord constructions, each optimized for a specific use. The cord may be composed by a different number of wires with various diameters. In the following examples, a 3&times;0.22 cord is used, formed from 3 wires of 0.22 mm diameter. The cords were then tested to evaluate their characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The expected reactivity of the cord formed by the drawn coated wires can be measured by subjecting the cord to a sulphidization reaction. This reaction simulates the adhesion reaction between the metal surface and the elastomeric compound material. A sample of the cord is immersed in a solution of sulfur in xylene at the boiling point (138 Deg. C.) The sample is then analyzed using Auger spectroscopy to measure the sulfur content present. A high ratio of sulfur to copper indicates high reactivity, and a low ratio indicates low reactivity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the Auger spectroscopy results for the same sample shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but after the sulphuring reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The relative reactivity of different sample cords can be compared after sulphidization by measuring the sulfur to copper ratio for each sample, as described above. Table 3 shows this comparison for some of the samples described in Table 1. The relative reactivity is obtained by defining the reactivity of sample BL3N6535, which is the most reactive as being equal to 100. The other samples have a lower reactivity, ranging between 50 to 80% of the reactivity of sample BL3N6535.
