<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a flexible manufacturing system. More particularly, this invention relates to a flexible manufacturing system that allows for efficient product development and line changes to accommodate changes in product design. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Disposable and durable products such as diapers, adult incontinence articles, feminine hygiene tampons, sanitary napkins, bandages, underpants, shirts, shorts, swimsuits, gowns, pants, coats, gloves, scarves, surgical drapes, bibs, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, mops, etc. may be manufactured on high speed converting lines. A converting line utilizes a web-based carrier to which many source materials, whether in a continuous web or discrete pieces, are processed and/or attached to the web to create a finished product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although a converting line may allow for high speed production, typical converting lines are inflexible in that line changes are time consuming and expensive. Product development and implementation of product upgrades usually require extensive testing and construction efforts. A product upgrade may, for example, require the following steps: constructing manual or handmade products incorporating the upgrade in order to test the concept and determine consumer acceptance of such an upgrade; constructing a machine production unit that may manufacture the product upgrade and/or the entire product incorporating the upgrade in order to determine product and process feasibility; constructing a high speed test stand that may manufacture the product upgrade in isolation at high speeds in order to test the feasibility of high speed manufacturing; constructing a prototype line that is able to make complete prototype products at high speeds; reconstructing a high speed production line to implement the process changes necessary for the product upgrade; and testing and debugging the production line. These efforts may be expensive and time consuming, especially when the reconstruction, testing and debugging steps lead to down time of a high speed production line. Then, when a product upgrade is rolled out on multiple production lines, the time and money required to implement even a small change in each individual line may increase dramatically. Often, the time and money required will be prohibitive, and highly desirable product upgrades may be delayed or even eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts to increase the flexibility of a converting line have been made. U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,988 entitled &ldquo;Modular Apparatus for Fabricating an Absorbent Article,&rdquo; issued to Thomas R. Herrmann et al. on Jan. 24, 1995 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,591 entitled &ldquo;Modular Apparatus for Fabricating an Absorbent Article,&rdquo; issued to Thomas R. Herrmann et al. on Feb. 20, 1996, for example, describe a system for fabricating absorbent articles that includes a linear array of substantially identical frame modules joined together. A plurality of substantially identical, removable panels that support working devices are mounted to one face of the modules. The Herrmann references describe that mounting the working devices to the removable panels facilitates rapid installation, servicing, adjustment of the working devices and accommodates convenient observation of the operation of such devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another attempt to increase the flexibility of a converting line is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,899 entitled &ldquo;Process Line for the Production of Absorbent Disposable Products,&rdquo; issued to Dag H. Gundersen on Feb. 9, 1999, which describes a converting line for manufacturing disposable absorbent articles in which removable rectangular carrier plates that carry working devices are attached to vertical and horizontal posts. The posts are arranged sequentially in a framework on the same side of and parallel to a conveyor path movement. The Gundersen reference describes that the working devices in the converting line may be removed from, replaced or inserted into the converting line by removing, replacing or inserting the carrier plate to or from the framework of vertical and horizontal posts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although these efforts may allow for quicker physical construction or reconstruction of a converting line once the process for manufacturing a newly developed product has been developed off-line, the steps of constructing a machine production unit that may manufacture the product upgrade and/or the entire product incorporating the upgrade in order to determine product and process feasibility; constructing a high speed test stand that may manufacture the product upgrade in isolation at high speeds in order to test the feasibility of high speed manufacturing; and constructing a prototype line that is able to make complete prototype products at high speeds are still required. Also, the lines disclosed in the Herrmann and Gundersen references, once constructed, still require significant testing and debugging time before the line may be used for production of products. Thus, a method allowing for quicker product and process development is desired. Minimizing down time due to testing and debugging a production converting line after construction or reconstruction is also desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, a typical product upgrade may be product-focused and includes changing one or more particular product features. In a disposable diaper, for example, a product upgrade may include making a multiple-layer back ear extensible. On a typical diaper converting line, each layer that ultimately forms part of the back ear may be introduced into the line, processed at various points along the line, combined together and attached to a carrier web. Various other operations that form other parts of the finished disposable diaper may be physically interspersed with these operations. Thus, the operations that produce a particular feature of the disposable diaper such as a multiple-layer back ear are located at various locations throughout the converting line. A product upgrade that makes the back ear extensible, for example, may involve changes to multiple operations that are spread throughout the converting line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, the control programming that controls each operation for producing the particular feature of the disposable product may be dispersed throughout the code for the entire converting line. Changing the control code for the particular upgrade may often include making changes in many different sections of the code that control particular operations that form the particular product feature being altered. Changes to multiple operations interspersed between operations not related to the product upgrade may also require changes to the control programming that handles any synchronization between each of these operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Changing out particular operations in different physical locations throughout the line as well as tracking down and changing code sections that control those operations in a program that controls the entire converting line may be time consuming, may result in inefficient problem-solving and may result in expensive down time of a high-speed production line. In contrast, however, bringing the physical operations that form a particular feature together and/or bringing the software code sections together that control the formation of the particular product feature together may result in efficiencies that cut both development time and change-over time for developing and implementing a product upgrade. These efficiencies may result in faster innovation, and quicker, more frequent and less expensive product upgrades. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a flexible manufacturing system having a control system and a physical arrangement that allows for efficient line changes to accommodate changes in product design. The flexible manufacturing system includes at least one &ldquo;feature section.&rdquo; Each feature section may include all or substantially all of the operational units that needed to fabricate a particular product feature. Each of the operational units of the feature section may be physically co-located in one portion of the converting line. The feature section may also have at least one distinct control routine that commonly controls the operation of substantially each operational unit in the feature section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the feature section may comprise one or more modules that include all or substantially all of the operational units for that feature section. In a further embodiment, the modules may be standard modules that may be configured to support different types of operational units. The operational units of a feature section may be grouped together in one or more modules that may be located together in the converting line and may be commonly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> One or more modules may be run off-line in a standalone operation, such as for a test stand, including the one or more modules and one or more local controllers that may be tested, adjusted or modified to perform product development work. In a particular embodiment, the one or more modules may comprise one or more feature sections that each has its own feature local controller. The one or more feature sections may be run off-line so that all or a portion of the operational units that comprise the feature section may be tested, adjusted or modified until a suitable process for forming a new product feature has been developed. Once a process for forming a product upgrade has been developed off-line, the module or modules that comprise a newly developed feature section may be inserted into a converting line or one or more modules already in the converting line may be replaced with the module or modules that comprise the newly developed feature section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the feature section may comprise a portion of a conventional converting line or a converting line such as the ones described in the Herrmann and Gundersen references. In either case, all or substantially all of the operational units for that feature section are preferably commonly controlled and physically co-located in one region of the converting line. In this embodiment, a test stand including substantially each of the operational units that make up the feature section may be developed so that not only the operation of each particular operational unit or only a few operational units may be analyzed, adjusted and modified, but the interactions between each of the operational units for the particular feature section may be analyzed, adjusted and modified. In this way, a complete prototype of the product feature may be assembled on the test stand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The flexible manufacturing system of the present invention also includes a method of synchronizing the operation of the feature section with the rest of the converting line. In one embodiment, the flexible manufacturing system may also include a central computer or a local controller that synchronizes the operation of the feature section with the rest of the converting line.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a flexible manufacturing system for manufacturing disposable, reusable and durable products. This application contains non-limiting examples of particular disposable absorbent articles. The manufacturing principles of the present invention, however, may be reapplied by one skilled in the art to manufacturing systems for the manufacture of many other types of disposable, reusable and durable products. Other embodiments of a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention are also disclosed in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/496,480 (P&amp;G Case No. 7939) entitled &ldquo;Flexible Manufacturing System&rdquo; filed on Feb. 2, 2000 by Vincent B. Lie et al, which is incorporated by reference in this application. As used herein, the term &ldquo;absorbent article&rdquo; refers to devices which absorb and contain body exudates, and more specifically, refers to devices that are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body. The term &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; is used to describe absorbent articles that generally are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article (i.e., they are intended to be discarded after a single use and, preferably, to be recycled, composted or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally compatible manner). (As used herein, the term &ldquo;disposed&rdquo; is used to mean that an element(s) of the diaper is formed (joined and positioned) in a particular place or position as a unitary structure with other elements of the diaper or as a separate element joined to another element of the diaper. As used herein, the term &ldquo;joined&rdquo; encompasses configurations whereby an element is directly secured to another element by affixing the element directly to the other element, and configurations whereby an element is indirectly secured to another element by affixing the element to intermediate member(s) which in turn are affixed to the other element.) One product that may be manufactured by a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention is the disposable absorbent article, diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. As used herein, the term &ldquo;diaper&rdquo; refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants and incontinent persons about the lower torso. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is a plan view of a unibody diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, which may be manufactured by a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention, in a flat-out state with portions of the structure being cut-away to more clearly show the construction of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The portion of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which faces the wearer is oriented towards the viewer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a liquid pervious topsheet <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>; a liquid impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>; an absorbent core <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, which is preferably positioned between at least a portion of the topsheet <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the backsheet <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>; side panels <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>; gasketing leg cuffs <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>; barrier leg cuffs <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>; an elastic waist <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>; a primary fastening system generally designated as <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>; and a secondary fastener <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>. Diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> to have a first waist region <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, a second waist region <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> opposed to the first waist region <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and a crotch region <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> located between the first waist region <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and the second waist region <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>. The periphery of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is defmed by the outer edges of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in which the longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> run generally parallel to a longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the end edges <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> run between the longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> generally parallel to a lateral centerline <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A chassis <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises the main body of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The chassis <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> comprises at least a portion of the absorbent core <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and preferably an outer covering layer including the topsheet <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the backsheet <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. While the topsheet <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the backsheet <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and the absorbent core <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may be assembled in a variety of well known configurations, preferred diaper configurations are described generally in U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 entitled &ldquo;Contractible Side Portions for Disposable Diaper&rdquo; which issued to Kenneth B. Buell on Jan. 14, 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092 issued to Buell on Sep. 9, 1992; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,274 issued to Buell on Jun. 22, 1993; and U.S. Pat.

No. 5,569,234 entitled &ldquo;Disposable Pull-On Pant&rdquo; which issued to Buell et al. on Oct. 29, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,411 entitled &ldquo;Zero Scrap Method For Manufacturing Side Panels For Absorbent Articles&rdquo; which issued to Nease et al. on Dec. 3, 1996; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/915,471 entitled &ldquo;Absorbent Article With Multi-Directional Extensible Side Panels&rdquo; filed Aug. 20, 1997 in the name of Robles et al.; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may also comprise side panels <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The side panels <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be elastic or extensible to provide a more comfortable and contouring fit by initially conformably fitting the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the wearer and sustaining this fit throughout the time of wear well past when the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has been loaded with exudates since the elasticized side panels <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> allow the sides of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to expand and contract. The side panels <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may also provide more effective application of the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> because even if the diaperer pulls one elasticized side panel <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> farther than the other during application, the diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will &ldquo;self-adjust&rdquo; during wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> An example of a multi-piece disposable diaper <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. The diaper <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> includes new features such as front ears <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and back ears <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. The front ears <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> may be constructed from any single or more than one stock materials and may be joined to the chassis <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by any means known in the art, including, but not limited to those means recited above. The back ears <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> may be elastic or extensible to provide a more comfortable and contouring fit. The back ears <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> may be constructed in various configurations. Examples of diapers with elasticized ears (or also known as side panels) are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,067, entitled &ldquo;Disposable Diaper Having Shirred Ears&rdquo; issued to Wood, et al. on Aug. 15, 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,781 issued to Sciaraffa, et al. on May 3, 1983; U.S. Pat. 4,938,753 issued to Van Gompel, et al. on Jul. 3, 1990; the herein before referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092 issued to Buell on Sep. 9, 1992; and U.S. Pat. No. 5, 221,274 issued to Buell on Jun. 22, 1993; U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Suitable materials for the various components of the sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> are described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. 5,460,623 issued to Emenaker, et al. and in the patent publications which are incorporated by reference herein. Preferably, the materials comprising at least the topsheet and backsheet are thermoplastic. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the topsheet <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> comprises the apertured thermoplastic film sold on sanitary napkins by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, under the trademark DRI-WEAVE, which is manufactured under U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,314 issued to Radel, et al. on Aug. 3, 1982, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,045 issued to Ahr, et al. on Jul. 31, 1984. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the absorbent core <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> comprises the absorbent core described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,623 issued to Emenaker, et al. The absorbent core <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> preferably comprises absorbent gelling material particles. The backsheet <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a polyethylene film. Preferably, the sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> further comprises an optional secondary topsheet <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight> positioned between the topsheet <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and the absorbent core <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;source material,&rdquo; as used in this application, includes any material supplied to the production machine regardless of the form in which it is supplied, e.g., a single layer or a multiple-layer laminate; a continuous web or discrete pieces; in a roll or in a box, etc., for the purpose of fabricating a disposable article or part of a disposable article. An &ldquo;element&rdquo; of a disposable article includes a manipulation of the web or of a discrete disposable article that alters the shape and/or configuration of the web or the discrete article. A &ldquo;component&rdquo; of a disposable article, however, refers to a web or a discrete piece that is combined with other components to form a disposable article. An element, for example, may include cutting a continuous web into discrete disposable articles, folding a discrete disposable article into a bi-fold or a tri-fold configuration, etc. A component, however, may include a fastening tape, a landing zone, a topsheet, a backsheet, an absorbent core, an acquisition component, an elastic strand, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;product feature&rdquo; is an element or a component of a finished disposable article. A product feature of a diaper such as the one described above may include, for example, an absorbent core <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a side panel <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a gasketing leg cuff <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>, a barrier leg cuff <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, an elastic waist <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a back ear <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> or a front ear <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. In a sanitary napkin, for example, a product feature may include an absorbent core <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> or a flap <highlight><bold>579</bold></highlight>. In a pair of shorts, for example, a product feature may include a waist feature, a pocket feature, a button or zipper fly feature, a cuff feature, a hem feature, a pleat feature, etc. In a sheet, a feature may include an elastic comer feature, a hem feature, etc. These examples are meant as merely illustrative and non-limiting examples of product features that may be manufactured in a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A flexible manufacturing system of the present invention may include a hierarchy of groupings such as transformations, corrective measures, transportations, operational units, functional operations and feature sections. In this hierarchy, a &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; includes a single, lasting and definite change in a source material, a product, an element or a component of a disposable article. A transformation may include, for example, nipping, ring-rolling, stretching, combining, embossing, applying, etc. A &ldquo;corrective measure&rdquo; includes performing a function on the web, a raw material or a component that is temporary or is later changed. A corrective measure may, for example, include heating a web that is later cooled, either through a direct cooling operation performed upon the web, e.g., a water bath or a stream of cool air, or indirectly cooled, e.g., contact with ambient air. A &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; may include transporting or positioning a web, a product, an element or a component of a disposable article on a manufacturing line. A transportation may include, for example, drawing or guiding a web, registering a component, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;operational unit&rdquo; includes one or more pieces of equipment that perform a single transformation on, a single corrective measure on, or a single transportation of a source material, a web, a product, an element or a component of a disposable article. A operational unit, for example, may include a pair of nip rolls, an adhesive applicator, an omega roll, an initial knife, a conveyor, etc. A &ldquo;functional operation&rdquo; includes multiple operational units that transform a source material, a web, a product, an element or a component of a disposable article to perform a particular function. A bonding unit that includes a glue applicator (operational unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and a pair of nip rolls (operational unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that receive a raw material web (source material <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and transform the raw material web by bonding it to another web (source material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), for example, performs a bonding function and comprises a functional operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;feature section&rdquo; includes one or more operational units and/or one or more functional operations that together completely form or assemble a particular product feature. A feature section may include each of the operational units and/or functional operations to form a particular product feature such as, for example, an absorbent core feature <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a cuff feature <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, a front ear feature <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>, a back ear feature <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, a side panel feature <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, an elastic waist feature <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a fastening feature <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, a fold and form feature, etc. A back ear feature section I shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> that produces a back ear feature <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, for example, may include a roller system (functional operation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) that provides a raw material web from a roll to a position parallel to a main web, a cut and slip unit (functional operation <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that cuts the raw material web into discrete back ear components and places the back ear components on a web in the right location and a bonding unit (functional operation <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) that bonds the ear to the web. A landing zone feature section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may include an roller system (functional operation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) that provides a landing zone raw material web from a roll, a metering system for guiding the landing zone and the backsheet webs (functional operations <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), a cut and slip unit (functional operation <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) that cuts the landing zone raw material web into discrete landing zone components and places these discrete components on the backsheet, and a bonding unit (functional operation <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) that attaches the discrete landing zone component to the backsheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A single functional operation such as a roller system, a cut and slip unit or a bonding unit, however, is not a feature section because it only provides, forms or assembles a portion of a product feature of a finished disposable article. A roller system that provides a raw material web from a roll to a position parallel to a main web, for example, only provides the material to the web. That same roller system in combination with a cut and slip unit that cuts the web into discrete side panels and places them onto a main web and a bonding unit that combines the side panel material with the web, however, together completely assemble the side panel product feature and thus make up a feature section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Many product upgrades seek to enhance the performance and/or the aesthetics of the product or decrease the cost of the product by changing one or more particular product features. A diaper product, for example, may be upgraded from a single cuff diaper having a gasketing cuff <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> to a multiple cuff diaper by adding a barrier leg cuff feature <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a product line may manufacture multiple different products on the same line by changing one or more product features. A line may manufacture a unibody design diaper, for example, in which the side panels are created by cutting notches in the web to create leg openings of a diaper. That same line may also manufacture a multi-piece design diaper such as the diaper <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> in which the side panel feature of the unibody design diaper <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is replaced by prefabricated back ears and front ears that may be produced off-line at a significant cost savings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> If the equipment that manufactures, attaches or assembles a complete or substantially all of product feature is physically co-located and commonly controlled, changing the production line to alter, replace or remove that feature from a product may significantly reduce the time and costs required for development, testing and line changeover efforts. In one particular embodiment, for example, each operational unit that is, or substantially all the operational units that are, used to manufacture, attach or assemble a particular product feature may be housed in one or more modules dedicated to that feature. These modules may be arranged adjacent to each other in the manufacturing line and may even be commonly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Although it is important that substantially each operational unit comprising a feature section be physically located in the same area of the line, such as within the one or more modules that comprise that particular feature section, it is not necessary that each operational unit making up a particular functional operation within that feature section be physically grouped together with the other operational unit(s) that together form that functional operation. In the back ear feature section I example, for instance, the bonding unit may include an adhesive applicator such as an adhesive sprayer or glue nozzle that is located upstream of the cut and slip functional operation, in between individual operational units that comprise the cut and slip functional operation or downstream of the cut and slip functional operation. The nip rolls that apply the pressure to bond the back ear to the web, however, are preferably located downstream of the cut and slip functional operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show one embodiment of a module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a perimeterically welded bottom frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed from a rectangular tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be joined to the bottom <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by welding, bolts, screws, pins or any other means used in the art. The top of the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be connected to two side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by welding, bolts, screws, pins, etc. The two side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be positioned vertically on opposite sides of the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and are generally perpendicular to the machine direction. (The term &ldquo;machine direction&rdquo; refers to the general direction in which the materials being processed move.) Each side support <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may form a welded parallelepiped construction having a cross bar <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and four side plates <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the four corners of the side support <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The two side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be connected by a top plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and two vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as by using screws <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. For added strength, the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be connected to a cross support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which also connects the two side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be of equal size or may be different sizes to accommodate different size operational units. Additionally, the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include one, two, three or more vertical plates such as the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. The bottom of the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be divided into four regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as by welded strips <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for positioning a lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (described in more detail below) in each region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include various numbers of regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and/or numbers of lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> depending upon the weight and distribution of the module load and the lifting capability of the lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> located under the base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be inflated simultaneously in order to avoid unnecessary tilting of the module and its load. For this, a manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> may distribute air among the lifting mechanisms via compressed air lines <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> connected between the manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by adjusting valves <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Further, the base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may include feet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the feet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be individually adjustable in order to level the module <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and align the module to the rest of the converting line. The module frames may be uniform dimensions or may vary in size. In one embodiment, the width (dimension in the machine direction) may vary, for example, from about 1 meter to about 2.5 meters to allow for relatively easy handling of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, the width of the module frames <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be standard dimensions such as 1 meter, 1.5 meters, 2 meters, and 2.5 meters in order to provide standard modules that may be used to house various sizes and numbers of operational units, and that may limit the number of modules that need to be kept in an inventory to allow for exchange of any module in the converting line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;module&rdquo; refers to a single and physically independent container that may contain one or more operational units to allow the one or more operational units to be moved within a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention. The one or more operational units function inside the module such as by manipulating, transforming or temporarily changing a source material in a designed sequence of a manufacturing process. The module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for example, contains the following operational units attached to the front of the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>: two unwinds <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for unwinding a landing zone material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; two omega rolls <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for metering the landing zone source material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; an automatic splicer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for splicing the landing zone material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; a dancer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for maintaining generally equal tension in the landing zone material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; an omega roll <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for feeding the landing zone material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; a tracking device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>; an adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for applying adhesive on the landing zone material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; an idler <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a turning bar <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> directing a backsheet material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>; an omega roll <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for metering the backsheet material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>; and a tracking device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> for tracking the backsheet material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> into a cutting device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The backsheet material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be fed from a reel <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> located on a side of the landing zone module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Some of the operational units, such as heavier ones, may be attached to the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or to both the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and one or more of the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cutting device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, for example, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> connected to both the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the vertical plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cutting device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may, for example, cut landing zone source material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and apply it onto a backsheet material <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In addition, the module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may contain a conveyor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for conveying a combined material <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that passes through the module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the upstream operations to the downstream operations on the production line (from right to left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, electric motors, such as servo motors, dc motors, ac vector drive motors, etc., for driving the operational units may be attached to the back of the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;servo motor&rdquo; may include a digitally controlled position servo motor and/or a digitally controlled velocity servo motor. A position servo motor is an electric motor controlled by regulating the position of an operational unit relative to a position of a reference signal and/or relative to a position of a product or a web. A velocity servo motor is an electric motor controlled by regulating the velocity of an operational unit relative to a velocity of a reference signal and/or relative to a velocity of a product or a web. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the motors shown attached to the back of the vertical plates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are: motors <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the omega rolls <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, respectively; motor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for the omega roll <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>; motors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for the cutting device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>; motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for the omega roll <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>; and motor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the conveyor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A module may be moved by means of lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> inserted under the base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be used for smooth movements of loads over gaps in the floor surface by creating a cushion of air between the floor surface and the lifting mechanisms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supporting the lifted module. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the function of the lifting mechanism <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supporting a load on a chamber plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Compressed air or any other fluid may be pumped into a circular bag <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which when inflated seals against the floor surface. (The term &ldquo;air&rdquo; used herein refers to any combinations of gases, including but not limited to atmospheric air.) When the air pressure in a chamber <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> exceeds the weight of the load located on the chamber plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, air generally slowly and evenly escapes between the circular bag <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the floor surface creating a cushion of air about 0.003 to 0.005 inches thick. The module floats on the cushion of air and may be moved around the floor for the purpose of arranging and/or re-arranging the production line. A suitable lifting mechanism may be GAPMASTER&trade; Aero-Caster manufactured by AeroGo, Inc., 1170 Andover Park West, Seattle, Wash. 98188-3909. The combined load capacity of four lifting mechanisms, for example, may be about 28,000 pounds for a 2.5 meter wide module. The ability to move the module may add flexibility to the flexible manufacturing system and allow for a change in a manufactured product in a more efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> After a module has been moved into a position adjacent to another module, the modules may be connected to each other at their respective side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>. In one particular embodiment, the side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be substantially identical for each module. In this embodiment, the modules may be positioned with a space, such as a 20 mm space, between them in the machine direction, and a spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or a set of one or more wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be inserted in the space created between the modules. The wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>,if used, may allow for easier insertion into the space between the module frames, especially, when a module frame is positioned between two other module frames. A pin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and two bolts may be inserted through the wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or through the spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the corresponding side plates <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of each of the connected module frames <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. An enlarged view of the exemplary connectors is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and a separated view of the exemplary pair of wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The bolts may be tightened with nuts to ensure a tight connection of module frames <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as they are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, one module may be joined to another module at two or more of the four corners of the side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> because two or more pins may provide the alignment of the connected modules. The spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be used on one side of the module and wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be used on the opposite side of the module. In one embodiment, the modules may be positioned in a linear fashion along the machine direction, however, the modules may be positioned in any other arrangement. For example, modules may be arranged perpendicular to the machine direction and may assemble one or more product features and feed the product feature(s) into the manufacturing line. The system for aligning the modules including one or more of the wedges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the pins <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the bolts described above is only one embodiment. Other known means of connection and alignment may be used within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Enclosure devices may be provided to suppress the noise level in the vicinity of the manufacturing line. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, for example, shows a perspective view of one embodiment of an operator side enclosure <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a flat roof enclosure <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> both enclosing the operator side of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The operator side enclosure <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a door support structure <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> comprising two end posts <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> attached to the opposite distal comers of the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a mid post <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> located between the end posts <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a rear view of one embodiment of a drive side enclosure <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> enclosing the drive side of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes two doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> each one pivotally attached to the two opposing side supports <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the operator side doors <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the drive side doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> may be assembled from a commercially available aluminum extrusion frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, shown in an enlarged perspective view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The aluminum extrusion frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> may include oppositely located slots <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> suitable for inserting a sponge extrusion seal <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on one side of the aluminum extrusion frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and a seal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> enclosing a transparent polycarbonate sheet material <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> on the other side of the aluminum extrusion frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The transparent polycarbonate sheet <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may be of a thickness from about 6 mm to about 12 mm of Lexan, Makrolon or any other brand. The aluminum extrusion frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and the corresponding seals <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> may be purchased from Item Industrietechnik and Maschinenbau GmbH of Germany. To all surfaces opposing the doors, a self adhesive gasket <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> may be adhesively attached, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>. The self adhesive gasket <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> may be purchased from Clean Seal Co. of South Bend, Ind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</cross-reference>, the operator side doors <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the drive side doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> may include panel boxes <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> for accepting various control devices described in more detail below. For example the box <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be used for an operator interface, the box <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may be used for a vision system monitor, the box <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> may be used for a junction box such as an electrical junction box or an adhesive junction box, etc. The number and the type of panel boxes may vary. The panel boxes may be pivotally attached to the door frame <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> for the panel boxes <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The pivotal arrangement enables an operator or maintenance personnel to view the pivoted control device when the door is open for accessing the machine. The self adhesive gasket <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference> may be adhesively attached to the panel boxes to insure a tight seal around the perimeter of the panel boxes. Other control devices such as an electrical disconnect switch or an air dump switch may be attached directly to the transparent polycarbonate sheet <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through seals <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, respectively, as shown, for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The seals <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> enclose openings <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, respectively, from both sides of the transparent polycarbonate sheet <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The operator side doors <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the drive side doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> may be of about the same length as the corresponding module which, for example, may vary from about 1 meter to about 2.5 meters in about 0.5 meter intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Other sound suppressing enclosures may include roof enclosures for enclosing the top of the operator side of the module frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. One embodiment of a roof enclosure <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, two roof elements <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> may be positioned on a roof platform <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> raised roof enclosure <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> may include roof elements <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> located on a platform <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> to create open areas <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> for supplying material webs, optionally, from the operator or from the drive sides of the manufacturing system, or from above the manufacturing system. (The modules may be configured so that material webs can be received from either the operator or the drive side of the module, or from above the module. Rotating a turning bar <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> degrees, for example, may be all that is necessary to change from one side to another side. Each material delivery option may offer a different advantage. Having the materials on the operator side consolidates an operator&apos;s work to one side of the machine. The operator may load the materials and monitor the production process more effectively with this arrangement. Locating the materials on the drive side may permit installation in manufacturing plants with narrowly spaced building columns. Having the materials stored above the modules may also conserve floor space in the manufacturing system.) The front opening <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> may be closed by an acoustic absorbent foam <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The side openings <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> may be closed by an acoustic absorbent foam <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The roof element <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> may include an acoustic absorbent foam <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> attached to a steel sheet <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The foams <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be about 50 mm thick and protected by a perforated steel sheet or a fabric or any other suitable means. For example, the acoustic foams <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be a melamine foam purchased from Illbruck Co. of Minneapolis, Minn. The roof enclosures <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> may be of about the same length as the corresponding module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Still another sound suppressing enclosure may include a base enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 18</cross-reference>. The base enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may include a dense containment layer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> built of sheet steel and an acoustic absorbent foam <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, similar to the foams <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> above, and similarly protected by perforated sheet steel or a fabric or any other suitable material. The base enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be inserted under the module frame base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The containment layer <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is formed along one edge to create a vertical wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> which may be attached to the module frame base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thus closing off the space between the floor and the module frame base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The vertical wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be attached to only one module in order to ensure that when that module is removed, the neighboring base enclosures are not disturbed. Each module may have at least two base enclosures <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> inserted under the module frame base <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from two opposite sides, preferably from the operator side and from the drive side. There may be a soft compliant synthetic rubber seal for closing the gap between the at least two opposite base enclosures <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The base enclosure <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be the same length as the corresponding module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Further, end barriers may be used to close a side of a module when the end of the module is exposed at the end of a series of modules. The end barrier may be constructed similar to the roof element <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if the side of the module needs to be visible, the end barrier may be constructed similar to the operator side doors <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and drive side doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> with large transparent polycarbonate sheets <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Finally, the above enclosures may be complemented with absorbent baffles <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> suspended inside the operator side or the drive side of the module when additional localized sound suppression is needed. The absorbent baffles <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be constructed of an acoustic foam <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> enclosed in a frame <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> including perforated sheet steel. Alternatively, the acoustic foam <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be enclosed by a protective fabric or any other suitable material. The absorbent baffles <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be suspended by hangers <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> constructed of any suitable material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Control Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A flexible manufacturing system of the present invention may include at least one feature section and a control system that controls the operation of the one or more operational units of the feature section(s). An individual operational unit may include one or more motion elements, such as a motor, and/or one or more logical devices, such as a valve, solenoid, relay, gate, sprayer, nozzle, switch, light, lamp, etc. The control system may control the operation of one or more individual operational units and/or synchronize or coordinate the operation of the individual operational units to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The control system may include &ldquo;local control functions&rdquo; and &ldquo;global control functions.&rdquo; A &ldquo;local control function&rdquo; refers to a function that is specific to the control within a particular feature section. A local control function, for example, may include motion, drive or logic control of individual operational units within a specific feature section. &ldquo;Motion control,&rdquo; as used in this application, refers to position control of one or more motors or profiled motion control of one or more motors such as camming or trajectory control. &ldquo;Drive control&rdquo; refers to continuous velocity and position control of one or more motors. &ldquo;Logic control&rdquo; includes using one or more logic functions to control the actuation of a logical device. A &ldquo;logic function&rdquo; may include, for example, combinational logic functions such as &ldquo;if then else&rdquo; functions, sequence functions, &ldquo;jump to subroutine&rdquo; functions, timer counter functions, etc. A local motion/drive control function, for example, may include controlling the velocity and/or position of a motor in a feature section. A local logic control function may include, for example, using logic functions to control the starting or stopping of an operational unit within a feature section, or actuating a solenoid, a reject gate or a safety disconnect switch within a feature section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;global control function&rdquo; refers to a control function that pertains to synchronizing or coordinating a local control function for a particular feature section to the remainder of the flexible manufacturing system. A global control function may synchronize or coordinate a local control function to the remainder of the flexible manufacturing system, for example, by informing the local control function of an event that occurred outside of the feature section, or by providing the local control function a reference signal that may be used by the local control function to synchronize or coordinate the operation of an operational unit within the feature section to the remainder of the flexible manufacturing system. A global control function may include, for example, a global motion, drive and/or logic control function that synchronizes or coordinates the operation of a local motion, drive and/or logic control function within a feature section with the operation of the rest of the flexible manufacturing system, a global start/stop logic control function that synchronizes or coordinates a local stop or start control function with the starting or stopping of the rest of the flexible manufacturing system, a global reject logic control function that synchronizes or coordinates a local reject logic control function with the rest of the flexible manufacturing system, or a global safety disconnect logic control function that synchronizes or coordinates a local safety disconnect logic control function with the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A global motion/drive control function that synchronizes or coordinates local motion/drive control functions is one example of a global control function. In one embodiment, for example, a global motion/drive control function may synchronize the local motion/drive control functions by providing a velocity and/or position reference signal to a local motion/drive control function that, in turn, controls a motor based upon the reference signal such as by a feedback or feed-forward control system. The reference signal may, for example, provide a velocity and/or position reference such as a digital or analog signal that ranges in amplitude, phase angle and/or frequency proportionately with the desired velocity and/or position of the overall flexible manufacturing system or of a product for synchronizing the local motion/drive functions with the overall operation of the flexible manufacturing system. This reference signal may be based upon a mechanical reference, such as a traditional master drive motor or mechanical line shaft, to which the velocity and/or position of motors within one or more feature sections may be matched. Alternatively, the reference signal may be a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; or electronically generated reference signal that is generated by the global motion/drive control function and provided to the local motion/drive control functions to control particular motors within the flexible manufacturing system. A virtual reference signal may be generated by solid state electronic hardware and/or software that may be immune from mechanical disturbances such as backlash or friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> A global logic control function may also coordinate the operation of local logical control functions. A global logic control function may, for example, provide start and stop signals to local logic control functions to coordinate the local logic functions to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. A global logic control function may also provide a logic reference signal that allows the local logic controllers to control the timing of logical device operation to the rest of the flexible manufacturing line. Alternatively, a local logic control function may utilize the velocity and/or position reference signal generated by a global motion/drive control function as described above (or, a local motion/drive control function may utilize the velocity and/or position reference signal generated by a global logic control function). In one embodiment, for example, the global logic control function may provide a digital or analog signal that may range in amplitude, phase angle or frequency proportionately with the desired velocity and/or position of the flexible manufacturing system or of a product for coordinating the local logic control function with the operation of the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. As described above with respect to the global motion/drive control function, the logic reference signal may be based upon a mechanical reference or a virtual reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As described above, a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention may include one or more feature sections. In one particular embodiment, for example, one or more of the feature sections may be controlled directly by a local feature control function. In this embodiment, the local feature control function may utilize a reference signal provided by a global control function to coordinate the operation of at least one motor and/or one logical device of the feature section to the remainder of the flexible manufacturing line. In a particularly preferred variation of this embodiment, the flexible manufacturing system includes at least two independent feature sections that each include a local control function that is adapted to directly control motors and logical devices for that feature section and to synchronize or coordinate those motors and logical devices to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system by utilizing one or more reference signals. In another variation, the local control function of each feature section may be adapted to directly control the motors and logical devices for that feature section in either a standalone mode or in the event that the feature section is integrated into an overall converting line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The global control functions and local control functions may be performed by or reside in a central computer, a local controller or a combination of a central computer and one or more local controllers. In one embodiment, the control system may include a central computer that performs global control functions and one or more local controllers that each perform local control functions for a particular feature section. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>, for example, exemplary global control functions and local control functions are depicted in the form of a block diagram. In this embodiment, the global control functions reside in the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, which may comprise software and/or hardware to perform global control functions such as a global motion/drive control function <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and/or a global logic control function <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight>. Examples of a global logic control function include a global operator interface control function <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, a global start/stop control function <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, a global reject control function <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, and a global safety disconnect function <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>. The local control functions may reside in feature local controllers, such as <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, which may comprise software and/or hardware to perform local control functions such as a feature local motion/drive control function <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> and/or a feature local logic control function <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight>. Examples of a local logic control function include a feature local operator interface control function <highlight><bold>1154</bold></highlight>, a feature local stop/start control function <highlight><bold>1156</bold></highlight>, a feature local reject control function <highlight><bold>1158</bold></highlight> and a feature local safety disconnect feature control function <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the central computer may perform both the global control functions and the local control functions for controlling the operation of one or more feature sections. In this embodiment, the central computer may comprise an integrated platform with local control software distributed on a per feature basis, i.e., the software performing the local control function for at least one feature section may comprise a separate control routine or data block. Although the separate control routine or data block may include calls to shared subroutines or may include shared data, the separate control routine or data block preferably includes at least one portion that is distinct to a particular feature section so that the control routine or data block for that feature section may be easily located in the event that the feature section is modified, moved within, added to or removed from the flexible manufacturing system. In yet another embodiment, the control system may include two or more local controllers without a central computer. In this embodiment, the local controllers each perform the local control function for a particular feature section. In addition, one or more of the local controllers perform the global control functions for the overall flexible manufacturing system as well as the local control functions for a particular feature section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</cross-reference>, for example, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may perform the global motion/drive control function <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> that synchronizes the operation of local motion/drive control functions <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may provide a reference signal that a local motion/drive controller may use to synchronize one or more motors that the local motion/drive controller is controlling. A &ldquo;motion/drive controller&rdquo; refers to a microprocessor-based system that controls the current, velocity and/or position of one or more motors. A motion/drive controller may also synchronize the operation of one or more motors such as by utilizing a reference signal provided by a global motion/drive control function. The motion/drive controller may, for example, control the velocity and/or position of a servo motor, a dc motor, an ac vector drive motor, etc. A motion/drive controller may also be capable of being integrated into a network of motion/drive controllers that synchronize one or more motors to a master machine velocity and position. The central motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> may directly control individual motors in a flexible manufacturing system or may provide a velocity and/or position reference signal over a network to one or more local motion/drive controllers. Each local motion/drive controller, such as local motion/drive controllers <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight>, may utilize the reference signal to synchronize the motor(s) that it directly controls to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. The central motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> may, for example, include a master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and a motion/drive control signal converter transmitter <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. The master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may provide a reference signal that may be used to synchronize the operation of a feature section to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. The master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may be connected to a central motion/drive control signal converter transmitter <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> by a motion/drive reference link <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and to a central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> by a motion/drive reference link <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>. The motion/drive reference links <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> may, for example, be variable frequency, phase angle and/or amplitude links. The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may be connected to a central operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> by a network link <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The global motion/drive control function may generate a virtual reference signal via solid state electronic hardware and/or software, which may be immune from mechanical disturbances such as backlash and/or friction. In one embodiment, the master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may provide a virtual reference velocity and/or position signal for synchronizing the operation of a feature section to the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. The master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may, for example, serve as an electronic encoder or resolver simulator and produce a signal comprising a series of pulses having a frequency that is relative to the desired velocity and/or position of the production line. The pulses may be configured in quadrature such that the master motion/drive reference signal is multiplied by four to obtain a higher resolution and accuracy. The pulses may also be converted into a serial format and transmitted over a network via a serial link to multiple local motion/drive controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may include a velocity input preprogrammed into the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> or may accept a velocity reference input from the central operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> via the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> or from one or more of the local feature operator interfaces such as <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may convert the velocity reference input into an input signal to the master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> using an algorithm in the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>. Further, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may vary the input signal provided to the master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> or other master machine reference hardware. The algorithm, for example, may vary the input signal provided to the master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> while the machine is moving so that the line can ramp up and down to predefined set points pre-programmed in the central computer or entered by the operator on an operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the master motion/drive reference signal may originate from a master drive motor or from a mechanical line shaft. In one embodiment, the master motion/drive reference signal may be proportional to the velocity and/or position of a master drive motor or a mechanical line shaft in the flexible manufacturing system. The central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may, for example, receive a motor reference signal such as from an encoder or a resolver mounted on the master drive motor or the mechanical line shaft. The motor reference signal may then be converted to or used as a master motion/drive reference signal and distributed via a network such as the motion/drive control sub-network <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight>. A local motion/drive controller, such as the first feature local controller <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight>, may use this master motion/drive reference signal to control the velocity of drive motors in that feature section. An exemplary control signal that may be generated as the master motion/drive reference signal is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,988 entitled &ldquo;Modular Apparatus for Fabricating an Absorbent Article,&rdquo; issued to Thomas R. Herrmann et al. on Jan. 24, 1995, which is incorporated by reference in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;logic controller&rdquo; refers to a microprocessor-based system that uses logic functions to control the actuation of and/or synchronization of logical devices such as solenoids, relays, valves, gates, sprayers, nozzles, switches, lights, lamps, etc. In one embodiment, a logic controller may be capable of being integrated into a network of logic controllers to pass information for the purpose of integrated logic control. The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may directly control individual logical devices in a flexible manufacturing system and/or may provide a reference signal to a network of feature local controllers, such as feature local controllers <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, that directly control the logical devices of the operational units within features of the flexible manufacturing system. The global logic function <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> may be performed by a central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>. The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may generate a velocity and/or position reference from pre-defined set points programmed into the central logic controller or from an operator interface, such as the central operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, and control the reference via software in the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>. The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may be integrated into a logic control network <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> with the first and second feature local logic controllers <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight>, respectively, by logic control network links <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight>. A standard series of software steps that performs functions such as logic control and information processing may be integrated in the logic controllers. In one embodiment, for example, the central and/or local feature logic controllers may include a programmable logic controller (&ldquo;PLC&rdquo;) in which a standard series of software steps that perform control functions and information processing are integrated into the PLC. In another embodiment, however, the central and/or local feature logic controllers may include a personal computer (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;), a mainframe, a micro computer or a mini computer in which flowchart programming techniques may be utilized to perform control functions and information processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may function as a network system integrator.

The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may integrate the starting and stopping of one or more feature sections by transmitting signals to and from the one or more feature section local controllers over the network. In addition, the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may also control a power distribution system and/or integrated safety systems via the network. Further, the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may monitor and control utilities for supporting operational units, such as adhesive tanks, vacuum systems, compressed air, glycol, etc. The central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may also accumulate production data information, such as a number of products made, a mean time between failure, a line efficiency, etc., and display the information on the main operator interface or transmit the information to the individual feature local controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may include multiple hardware components that perform distinct control functions, or may comprise a single multi-function computer to perform some or all of the various control functions. The central computer may, for example, include a combination of a an Encoder Signal Reference Simulator (ESRS) manufactured by Rockwell International and a programmable logic controller such as a 1785-L40C PLC-5 manufactured by Rockwell to perform the global motion/drive control function <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the central computer may include a programmable logic controller (&ldquo;PLC&rdquo;) to perform the global logic control function <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight>, and a personal computer (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;) to perform the global motion/drive control function <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>.

Alternatively, the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may include a single multi-function computer system such as a personal computer, mainframe, microcomputer, mini-computer, etc. that performs each of the global motion, drive and logic control functions, and the global data collection and reporting function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In addition, the various pieces of hardware that may comprise the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, may be housed in a single panel or may include multiple components in different panels that are located adjacent to each other or distributed throughout the manufacturing system. In one embodiment, for example, the panel that houses a central motion/drive controller may be located close to a master drive motor or a mechanical line shaft if one of these methods of creating a master motion/drive reference signal is used, while the panel that houses the central logic controller may be located in another panel somewhere else along the flexible manufacturing system. The central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may be housed in one or more control panels such as the central computer control panel <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>. The central computer control panel <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> that houses the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may be located on the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> or in another area of the flexible manufacturing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Each feature section may include one or more modules and a feature local controller. A feature local controller may include a feature local motion/drive controller and/or a feature local logic controller. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, for example, shows a simplified view of one embodiment of a flexible manufacturing system of the present invention including a control system <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> for two feature sections <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>.

A flexible manufacturing system of the present invention, however, may include one, two, three or more feature sections. In the flexible manufacturing system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, the first feature section <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> includes first and second first feature modules <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1084</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the second feature section <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> includes one second feature module <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the control system <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> preferably includes a central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, and first feature and second feature local controllers <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> for controlling the operational units of the first and second feature sections <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>, respectively.

The second feature local controller <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> may include a second feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> and/or a second feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight>. The first feature local controller <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and/or the second feature local controller <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> may also include a local operator interface such as <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Each module may comprise one or more operational unit(s): the first and second modules <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1084</bold></highlight> of the first feature section <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> may comprise a first feature section first operational unit <highlight><bold>1092</bold></highlight> and a first feature section second operational unit <highlight><bold>1094</bold></highlight>, and the module <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight> of the second feature section <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> may comprise a second feature section operational unit <highlight><bold>1096</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Each operational unit may comprise one or more motor(s) and/or one or more control device(s). (The term &ldquo;control device&rdquo; as used in this application refers to devices such as a solenoid, a photo eye, a proximity switch, a temperature sensor, a relay, a small AC motor for driving a web tracking mechanism, or any other control device known in the art.) The first feature section operational units <highlight><bold>1092</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1094</bold></highlight> may comprise first feature section motors <highlight><bold>1057</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight>, and first feature section control devices <highlight><bold>1073</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second feature section operational unit <highlight><bold>1096</bold></highlight> may comprise a second feature section motor <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> and a second feature section control device <highlight><bold>1076</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The first and second feature local controllers <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> may be integrated into a network with the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. The network may include, for example, two sub-networks: a motion/drive control sub-network <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> by which the central motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> is connected via links <highlight><bold>1128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1142</bold></highlight> to the first feature and second feature local motion/drive controllers <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight>, respectively, and a logic control sub-network <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> by which the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> is connected via links <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight> to the first feature and second feature local logic controllers <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight>, respectively. The information transmitted over the motion/drive control sub-network <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> may, for example, represent the distances that the master drive encoder or a virtual master drive encoder has moved. Information transmitted over the logic control sub-network <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight> may, for example, include machine set points, product quality information, machine status and run condition, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As described above, a feature section includes one or more operational units. Each operational unit may include at least one motor and/or at least one logical device. In one embodiment of the present invention, the motor may be an independently-driven servo motor. In this embodiment, the velocity and position of operational units need not be phased by a common mechanical line shaft. There may be no mechanical coupling between the operational units, and the velocity and position of the operational units may be synchronized by the feature local controller with respect to a common positional and/or velocity reference. The source of the common reference may be any of the master motion/drive references described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The motion/drive controllers may be connected to one or more servo motor(s). In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, for example, the first feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> may be connected with the servo motors <highlight><bold>1057</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight> of the first and second modules <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1084</bold></highlight> of the first feature section <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> by power and feedback cables <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, and, similarly, the second feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> may be connected with the servo motor <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> located in the module <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight> of the second feature section <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> by power and feedback cables <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A motor motion/drive control system may include, for example, one or more of the following component(s): a feature section motion/drive controller; an electric motor such as a servo motor, a dc motor an ac vector drive motor, etc.; and/or an electric motor position feedback sensor such as an encoder or a resolver. The feature section motion/drive controllers <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> may include one or more programmable motion/drive controllers and one or more power converter/amplifier. A programmable motion/drive controller may control a motor using a specific control routine or configuration that includes a set of preprogrammed or operator defmed control steps or set points. The control steps or configuration may, for example, include instructions on the relative velocity and/or position of one or more motors to a master reference signal. A position feedback sensor for the motor shaft may also be connected to the programmable motion/drive controller. The programmable motion/drive controller may calculate the position of the servo motor shaft relative to a master reference signal using the feedback sensor, and follow preprogrammed instructions to adjust the velocity and/or position of the motor to match the relative velocity and position of the master reference signal. In one embodiment, for example, the master reference signal may include a frequency, amplitude and/or an angle to represent the reference velocity and position for the flexible manufacturing system. A motor power converter/amplifier may control the amount of electrical current applied to the motor to maintain its relative position to the master reference signal. The amount of electrical current required may be determined by the motion/drive controller and may be based on the amount of error calculated between the motor&apos;s shaft and the relative velocity and/or position of the master reference. The motion/drive controller may also transmit, via an analog or digital network, to the logic controller information such as status codes, error codes, velocity and position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In order to assist in line changeovers, product size variations, etc., the programmable motion/drive controller may have several alternative routines from which a line operator may choose to configure the line to assemble a particular product. Alternatively, the control routines may use operator-defined set points to control the operation of various motors in a feature section. In a further embodiment, if the programmable motion/drive controller may be connected to a network as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, and the control routines may be replaced, deleted or modified over the network. The network, in one embodiment, may be an ethernet, a Control Net &trade; product of Rockwell International), a combination of the two, or any other type of network known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The motor may be mechanically connected to one or more operational unit(s) and electrically connected to the motor power converter/amplifier. The mechanical interface between the motor and the operational unit may be a gear or a pulley set and/or a combination, or it may be a direct link. Operational units that are required to be pitched to a product, i.e., phased once, twice, etc. per product, on the production line may have motors that are configured as &ldquo;pitched&rdquo; motor systems to rotate at a velocity that is synchronized with the product pitch. In one embodiment, an operator may synchronize the velocity of the motor with the product pitch by selecting the number of encoder pulses of a line shaft or a master drive motor on the converting line or the number of virtual encoder pulses transmitted over the motion/drive control network that represent a single product pitch at the operator interface. The local motion/drive control function may synchronize the operation of a pitched operational unit to a single product length. For example, a single revolution or linear movement of the pitched operational unit may correspond to an integer number of product lengths, or an integer number of revolutions or linear movements of the pitched operational unit may correspond to a single product length. In one embodiment, a feature local controller may synchronize the rotation or linear movement of the pitched operational unit to a single product length by multiplying the set number of encoder or virtual encoder pulses by the gear ratio for the particular motor that drives that operational unit. The gear ratio is dependent upon the mechanical connection between the motor and the operational unit, and the number of products that may be produced by one rotation or linear movement of the operational unit. The gear ratio may be preprogrammed or set by an operator for a particular motor in a feature section. In an alternative embodiment, the rotational or linear velocity of the operational unit may be synchronized with the product pitch by preprogramming, or by the operator selecting at the operator interface, the number of products that will be produced in a given time frame, e.g., 100 diapers per minute. Operational units that are not required to be pitched to the product may have motors that are mechanically coupled to the non-pitched operational units and may be configured as non-pitched motor systems. The non-pitched operational unit may follow the relative velocity of the master reference. The operator may have the ability to change or adjust the motor velocity of the non-pitched operational unit to compensate for various changes in raw materials and/or a product size, or this may be done through programming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> An independently-driven servo motor allows for more rapid changes in motor velocity and position versus the remainder of the line because software control of the servo motor may be more rapidly changed out than traditional mechanical linkages, gears, belt drives, etc. Using digitally controlled servo motors may also allow for more accuracy in product making because they may provide a higher degree of synchronization and position control over traditional line shaft and/or belt drives, especially in a long drive train. Furthermore, digitally controlled servo motors may also allow for &ldquo;push button&rdquo; changeovers that allow an operator to select a product from pre-configured program set points for one or more of the logic and motion/drive control systems to direct the motion/drive of one or more of the servo motors to automatically make the desired product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As described above, an operational unit may include one or more logical devices. In one embodiment, the local logic control functions may be housed in a feature local logic controller that directly controls the operation of the logical devices for that feature and synchronizes or coordinates the operation of those logical devices with the rest of the flexible manufacturing system. The feature local logic controller may synchronize or coordinate the operation of the local logical devices by using a master logic reference signal that is generated by the central logic controller and transmitted over a network, such as the logic control sub-network <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>, to the feature local logic controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The feature local logic controllers may be connected with one or more control devices and/or one or more operator interfaces in a remote local network. The first feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> may, for example, be connected with the first feature control devices <highlight><bold>1073</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight> located in the first and second modules <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1084</bold></highlight> of the first feature section <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> and with a first feature operator interface <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> by the first feature remote local network links <highlight><bold>1138</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> may, for example, be connected with the second feature control device <highlight><bold>1076</bold></highlight> located in module <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight> of the second feature section <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> and with a second feature operator interface <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> by the second feature remote local network links <highlight><bold>1134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1136</bold></highlight>. The feature remote local networks may be a digital internal control network for a feature section. This feature remote local network may originate at a feature local logic controller and connect the operational unit control devices with the logic controller via remote input and output electronic modules. The first feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight>, for example, may be connected to the first feature operational unit control devices <highlight><bold>1073</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight> via the first feature remote local network <highlight><bold>1146</bold></highlight>. The second feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight>, for example, may be connected to the second feature operational unit control device <highlight><bold>1076</bold></highlight> via the second feature remote local network <highlight><bold>1148</bold></highlight>. The internal network may also connect the feature local logic controller with its corresponding operator interface such as the first and second feature local logic controllers <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> with the first and second feature operator interfaces <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight>, respectively. Signals transmitted over a feature remote local network may include, for example, status from control devices located in one or more of the modules included in a feature section. </paragraph>

A feature section <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include one or more adhesive applicators <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> housed in a module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the feature section <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. The adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be of any type used in the art and may receive adhesive from an adhesive tank <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> via a pump <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, a supply hose <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, a remote meter <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, and a feature adhesive supply hose <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. The remote meter <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> may be driven by a servo motor <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, which may be controlled by the feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight>. The feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> may include multiple, independent single axis programmable motion/drive controllers <highlight><bold>963</bold></highlight> such as 1398-DDM-009 controllers manufactured by Rockwell International for each motor that is to be controlled, and/or one or more multiple axis programmable motion/drive controllers such as a 1394-SJT10T-RL controllers manufactured by Rockwell International that may control multiple motors. The feature local motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> may control the servo motor <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> via a drive and feedback control cable <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>. A feature adhesive supply hose <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> may supply the adhesive from the remote meter <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> to the adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the adhesive in the remote meter <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, the feature adhesive supply hose <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and the adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> via a power and feedback cable <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, which may be connected to the local logic controller <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> through an adhesive junction box <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> and remote local network link <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>.

The feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> may be connected, such as by an adhesive stitching control cable <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>, to an electrical-to-pneumatic converter <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight> located in the module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The converter <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight> may be connected to the adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> via compressed air tubing <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The converter <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight> may receive compressed air <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> and provide on/off supply of compressed air to the adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> for starting and stopping the adhesive flow through the adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment of the present invention, a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> may be configured containing standard hardware and/or software for controlling the operation of adhesive applicators throughout the flexible manufacturing system. A standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, for example, may be used for each feature section of the flexible manufacturing system of the present invention that includes an adhesive applicator. The feature-specific hardware and/or software required for controlling a particular adhesive applicator such as adhesive applicator <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be included with the feature local logic controller <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight>, and/or may be added to the standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>. Utilizing standard adhesive panels may allow adhesive operational units to be added or removed from a feature section without reconfiguring the feature local controller of the feature section. In this embodiment, for example, the logic controller <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> may be connected to a logic control panel input and output section <highlight><bold>966</bold></highlight> located in the adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> via a remote local network link <highlight><bold>1224</bold></highlight>.

Each of the standard control panels may be limited in space so that it may only house control hardware for a fixed number of electric motors, logical devices, etc. In this embodiment, when a feature section consists of more than the fixed number of electric motors, logical devices, etc. that a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> may house, one or more standard auxiliary control panels <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> may also be used. In addition, a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 58</cross-reference>, and described above, may be used to house the hardware for a particular feature local controller that controls an adhesive system in the feature section. Alternatively, additional standard control panels may be configured to contain the hardware that controls other subsystems of a feature section such as motion/drive or logic control aspects of the feature local controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows, for example, a portion of an exemplary flexible manufacturing system of the present invention in which the feature local controllers are housed in standard control panels on a panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> adjacent to the modules of the feature sections that the feature local controllers control. The cuff feature section A is shown adjacent to a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>A and a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>A that together comprise the feature local controller for the cuff feature section A. The side panel feature section C is shown adjacent to a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>C and a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>C that together comprise the feature local controller for the side panel feature section C. Next, the landing zone feature section D is shown adjacent to a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>D and a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>D that together comprise the feature local controller for the landing zone feature section D. The fastening feature section E is shown adjacent to a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>E, a standard auxiliary control panel <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>E and a standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>E that together comprise the feature local controller for the fastening feature section E. Finally, the fold and form feature section F is shown adjacent to a standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>F and a standard auxiliary control panel <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>F that together comprise the feature local controller for the fold and form feature section F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Some modules of the flexible manufacturing system of the present invention, however, may perform a collection of process steps that are not directly related to the production of a product feature. The chassis combining in-feed module <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> and the chassis combining module <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, collectively identified as section B of the flexible manufacturing system, for example, do not comprise a feature section for the purposes of the present invention. The operational units in these modules combine webs that form the carrier for the manufacturing line, but do not form a particular product feature. Rather, the operational units within these modules comprise a functional operation of combining multiple webs. In this example, multiple operational units that are not part of a feature section may be located in one portion of the flexible manufacturing system and commonly controlled by one or more local controllers such as the local controllers located in the standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>B and standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>B for the chassis combining in-feed module <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> and the chassis combining module <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, operational units or functional operations that do not form a feature section may be housed in the modules of a feature section that has space. For example, a side notch device <highlight><bold>778</bold></highlight> that removes a portion of the web and is described below may be housed in one of the modules of the fastening feature section E and may be controlled by the feature local controller of the fastening feature section E that is housed in standard main control panel <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>E, standard auxiliary control panel <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>E and standard adhesive control panel <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;operator interface&rdquo; as used in this application refers to a microprocessor-based system that may allow an operator to input data and receive data from a central computer or from a local controller. A flexible manufacturing system of the present invention may include a central operator interface that may be connected to the central computer and one or more local operator interfaces that may be connected to one or more feature local controllers. The central operator interface may obtain information from the central logic controller in the central computer and may integrate the line data from one or more feature local controllers and display the data for the operator. The central operator interface may also distribute the data input from the operator to one or more feature local controllers. An operator interface may also be the origin of one or more machine set points such as motor parameter set points, glue temperatures, and programmable cam limits. The operator interface may also hold a database for other displays on the line, such as electronic annunciation systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The central operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference> and the first feature and second feature operator interfaces <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight>, respectively, may display for the operator the messages concerning malfunctioning of the manufacturing system such as alarm messages. Some examples of alarm messages may be a number of product rejects, a tissue break, an above tolerance torque on a servo motor, a misalignment of a component, an above tolerance temperature, etc. The alarm messages for a feature section may be displayed on a feature operator interface and/or on a central operator interface. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>, for example, the alarm messages for the first feature section <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> may be displayed on the first feature operator interface <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, and the alarm messages for the second feature section <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> may be displayed on the second operator interface <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight>. However, the central operator interface <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> may display the alarm messages related to both feature sections <highlight><bold>1078</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the alarm messages may be stored in the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> of the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, for example, may utilize the following commercial hardware: the master motion/drive reference <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may be an Encoder Signal Reference Simulator (ESRS) manufactured by Rockwell International; the motion/drive control signal converter transmitter <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> may be an ALEC-4100 Axislink Encoder Converter manufactured by Rockwell; the central logic controller <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> may be 1785-L40C PLC-5 manufactured by Rockwell; the motors <highlight><bold>1073</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1076</bold></highlight> may be <highlight><bold>1326</bold></highlight> Servo Motors manufactured by Rockwell; the motion/drive controllers <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> may be 1394-SJT10-T-RL controllers manufactured by Rockwell; the feature local logic controllers <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> may be 1785-L40C15PLC-5 Processors manufactured by Rockwell; the feature operator interfaces <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> may be a 1585THX&plus;1242 manufactured by IDT Cutler Hammer of Ohio; the central main operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> may be a D735SVPR64DWNT manufactured by IDT Cutler Hammer of Ohio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> illustrates a feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight>. The feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may be adapted to be an addition to the manufacturing system and/or a substitution of one or more feature sections. The feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may be capable of producing a new product feature or a modified product feature. Further, the feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may be capable of producing an alternative product feature to one produced by the feature section that is being replaced. In this embodiment, the feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may be interchanged with another feature section in order to allow the line to produce a different product or a different variation of a product (e.g., a different size). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> shows that feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may include at least one module <highlight><bold>1089</bold></highlight> and at least one feature local controller <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Further, the module <highlight><bold>1089</bold></highlight> may include at least one operational unit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> which may include at least one control device <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and/or at least one motor <highlight><bold>1098</bold></highlight>. The feature local controller <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> may also include at least one motion/drive controller <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and at least one logic controller <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. Still further, the feature section <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight> may include at least one feature operator interface <highlight><bold>1107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When a feature section is removed from or added to the manufacturing system, the alarm files concerning the removed or added feature section may be removed from or added to the central computer <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. See e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the central computer may contain the alarm files for various feature sections and when the central computer is informed, such as by an operator input, a software flag from the feature local controller or stored within the central computer itself, the central computer may look up the correct alarm file corresponding to that feature section. The term &ldquo;updating alarm files&rdquo; may include both the removal and/or the update of the alarm files, or may include informing the central computer of the feature section that is currently connected to the manufacturing system. The alarm files may be updated manually or automatically. Manually updating alarm files may involve, for example, connecting a personal computer <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>), having logic control software, to the logic control sub-network link <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> for removing the alarm files stored in the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> or for adding new alarm files into the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>. Automatically updating alarm files may involve having the central logic controller <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> read alarm files in every feature local controller of the manufacturing system via the logic control sub-network links <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight> after an initialization signal has been provided by the operator from the main operator interface <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>) or from the feature operator interface <highlight><bold>1107</bold></highlight> (See e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21, 23A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> show a panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that may support a fluid utility system <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an electrical power system <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, standard control panels <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, standard main control panels <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>, standard auxiliary control panels <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, standard adhesive control panels <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, source material, etc. to provide more operating floor space and improved access to the converting line. The panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be about the same length as the manufacturing line, and may be located immediately adjacent to the drive side of the line. The panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be prefabricated in lengths that can be easily shipped to a plant site in standard shipping containers and assembled quickly on the plant site by using commercial hardware as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The prefabricated sections may include one or more platform <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, support columns <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, stairs <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, safety hand rails <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, wireways <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, two power distribution bus ducts <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, utility header supports <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, and cross braces <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The platforms <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> may be of standard lengths, such as about 3.5 and/or about 4 meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> There are preferably two rows of columns <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> supporting the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. The row <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is located along the edge of the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> immediately adjacent to the modules and the row <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is located along the side distant from the modules. The support columns are preferably of a moveable design and are preferably located adjacent to the connecting line between the modules. This location creates a convenient access to the drive side of the modules by allowing the drive side guard doors <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> to be open a full 90 degrees without obstruction. In the event a change such as a product upgrade or product change for the manufacturing line results in a change of a module length, and this results in a column blocking access to one or more modules, it may be desirable to relocate the column to the connecting line location between two modules. To accomplish this quickly, the platform beam <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> to which the support column <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>) attaches is preferably pre-drilled with a series of holes that allow it to be reattached without further modification to the platform beam <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> or the column <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The hole pattern may be repeated incrementally in a distance equal to the incremental difference between different size modules used in the converting line. For example, if the modules of a particular converting line are 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 meters in width, the hole patterns may be repeated every 0.5 meters along the panel support structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</cross-reference>, the utility header supports <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> may be used to support piping for compressed air, vacuum, glycol, etc. directed to parts of the manufacturing line where they are needed. Having them supported independently from the modules and from the control panels enhances the ability to make rapid changes of the modules of the manufacturing line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The wireways <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> may be used to support electrical control cables, power cables, adhesive hoses, etc. that may be run to a particular module as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A, 25</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This approach may save time during the initial installation and whenever a module is removed, added or replaced for an upgrade because operators are not required to disturb or re-pull unrelated cables or hoses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</cross-reference> illustrates the positioning of a module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in relation to the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and also connections of the module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to a fluid utility system <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and to an electric power system <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be located adjacent to the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> under a header support <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. The header support <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is attached to the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and supports the fluid utility system <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which may include headers attached to the header support <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> such as the following: a compressed air header <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a low vacuum header <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a house cleaning vacuum header <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a high vacuum header <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, a glycol supply header <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and a glycol return header <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The headers may include separate sections of headers connected together to form a continuous header system generally along the full length of the manufacturing line. The headers may be connected via pipe, ducts, hoses or tubes (also called &ldquo;drops&rdquo;) to quick disconnects located immediately above the module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</cross-reference>. The quick disconnects may include a compressed air quick disconnect <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, a low vacuum quick disconnect <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, a house cleaning vacuum quick disconnect <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, a high vacuum quick disconnect <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and two glycol quick disconnects <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The quick disconnects may be operated without tools and shorten the time needed to connect and disconnect the utilities. To minimize the number of connections, it is preferable to have no more than one entry per utility for each module. From that entry, a particular fluid utility is routed inside the module to desired destinations. If a particular utility is not required for a particular module, the header of this utility may be closed off such as with an end cap or a valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>A, the electrical power may be supplied from a power distribution center <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to a motion bus <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and an auxiliary bus <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> via power cables <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, respectively. Both the motion bus <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary bus <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> may be attached to the panel support structure <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">Safety Lockout </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing system of this invention includes a safety lockout system for shutting off the electrical power supply from the manufacturing system and for preventing an inadvertent motion of the manufacturing system during the shutdown. The safety lockout system may be any lockout system used in the art of machine control, however, in one particular embodiment of the invention, the safety lockout system may be an 800 ampere rated lockout system from Moeller Electric Company of Bonn, Germany. This safety lockout system enables having a safety disconnect in every module connected to a 24 volts control cable instead of running heavy power cables (for example, 400 volts) between the modules. The latter option would be more costly and take more physical space. The capability of having a power disconnect at every module provides safety and convenience for the operators and maintenance personnel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Standalone Operation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a two-module feature section being used as a standalone operation <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The modules may be operated off-line in order to develop product feature upgrades in which the operational units of the feature section may be modified until the product feature is being made as desired. The modules may also be run off-line to test their operation before they are installed in a converting line. Alternatively, the standalone operation <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be used as a standalone production center for producing components of a diaper or other disposable article off-line. In this particular example, the back ear in-feed module <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and the back ear application module <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are provided with an unwind device <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and a rewind device <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. The unwind device <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> provides a web material <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> from a reel <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> of the web <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> onto which the back ears <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, produced by the modules <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> from the back ear material <highlight><bold>854</bold></highlight> may be applied to produce a combined web <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the web material <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> may be a product web that includes all the features of a finished disposable article except the feature(s) being assembled by the feature section(s) being run in a standalone mode. The rewind device <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> creates a rear of the combined web <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> including the back ears <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The stand-alone operation <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be supported by a docking station for supplying power distribution, safety systems, compressed air, vacuum, glycol, adhesive(s) and other utilities as needed. One or more modules of the stand-alone operation <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be connected to the docking station similarly as they would have been connected on a manufacturing line and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</cross-reference>, and described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> During standalone mode operation, a feature local controller may control the operation of the operational units in the feature section. The feature local controller may independently synchronize and coordinate the operation of the motors and logical devices in the feature section, or may receive a reference signal from an external source that may be used to simulate the reference signal described above that it would receive in a converting line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Use of individual modules or feature sections as &ldquo;test stands&rdquo; for a portion of a product may eliminate a step from typical product upgrades. For example, a standalone operation including the operational units that form a particular product feature into one feature section that (or a substantially identical feature section that) may ultimately be plugged directly into a production converting line may allow for combining the steps of constructing a high speed test stand that may manufacture a particular product feature being upgraded in isolation at high speeds in order to test the feasibility of high speed manufacturing and constructing a prototype line that is able to make complete prototype products including the particular product feature at high speeds of a typical product upgrade development. Thus, once built and tested, the standalone feature section that may function as the high speed test stand may also be inserted into a prototype line and products including the newly developed product feature may be assembled at high speeds without having to construct or reconstruct a complete prototype line. Further, the standalone feature section(s) may first be utilized as a preliminary machine production unit that may manufacture the feature section being upgraded and/or the entire product incorporating the feature section in order to determine product and process feasibility, then as a high speed test stand and finally inserted into a high speed prototype line. Also, once the product feature upgrade has been successfully produced on a high speed prototype line, the feature section(s), or substantially similar feature section(s), may be inserted into one or more production lines. Even further, where multiple production lines are designed in accordance with the present invention, product upgrades may be easily rolled out over multiple production lines because substantially similar or identical feature sections that have been tested on a pilot line or another production line may be easily inserted into multiple production lines after the testing and debugging of the feature sections have been completed on other lines. Thus, the down time of each production line may be drastically reduced. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Exemplary Product Upgrade </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> An exemplary product upgrade of a manufacturing line such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 37</cross-reference> may include changing a multiple-layer back ear <highlight><bold>854</bold></highlight> of the diaper shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> so that it is extensible. In this example, the back ear <highlight><bold>854</bold></highlight> may be made extensible such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092 entitled &ldquo;Absorbent Article With Dynamic Elastic Waist Feature Having a Predisposed Resilient Flexural Hinge&rdquo; issued to Kenneth B. Buell et al. on Sep. 29, 1992, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,801 entitled &ldquo;Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-Like Behavior&rdquo; issued to Charles W. Chappell et al. on May 21, 1996, each of which is incorporated by reference. In the manufacturing line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 37</cross-reference>, for example, the back ear in-feed module <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> or the back ear applicator module <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, which together form the back ear feature section I, may be modified to include operational units that make the back ear <highlight><bold>854</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> extensible. The new back ear feature section may be tested off-line until the back ear feature section is assembling back ears that have an acceptable extensibility and is applying the back ears to a web in a satisfactory manner. Then, the existing back ear in-feed module <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> in the manufacturing line may be replaced by the new back ear in-feed module that provides an extensible back ear web to the back ear application module <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Methods Of Line Change </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing system of this invention may provide flexibility for removing at least one feature section from the manufacturing system and/or adding another feature section to the manufacturing system. For example, if there is a need to change a product design that involves a change in a design of a particular product feature, a feature section of the manufacturing system producing that product feature may be removed from the manufacturing system and another feature section adapted for producing the new product feature may be used to replace the removed feature section. The added feature section may physically fit or not fit in the space vacated by the removed feature. If the added feature section physically fits into the space, then no change in the position of adjacent feature section(s) may be necessary. However, if the added feature section physically does not fit into the space, then a change in position of adjacent feature section(s) may be necessary. Further, if there is a need to add a new product feature to a product, a new feature section may be added to the manufacturing system. Adding a new feature may or may not involve a change in position of adjacent feature section(s). </paragraph>
