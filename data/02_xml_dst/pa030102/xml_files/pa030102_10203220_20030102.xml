<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The circuit arrangement or the operating method ensure that the fingerprint sensor is started automatically when a sufficiently high-contrast image can be produced. To this end, test runs are carried out in which only pan of the pixels, for instance along a column or line of a matrix-like array in a square raster, are taken into account. It is determined whether the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the sensor signals exceeds a predetermined value. In said case, the normal scanning procedure of the fingerprint sensor is started. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> In the case of a fingerprint sensor, a raster-shaped arrangement of individual sensor elements that are assigned to the points of the image to be detected is usually present in one plane, and electronic circuit components for determining a signal are connected thereto. The individual sensor elements that are set up for capacitive measurement, for example, are driven in series, and this can be done by row or column in the case of a rectangular raster and thus of a matrix-like arrangement of the pixels. To date, a fingerprint sensor is always started anew and delivers a complete fingerprint image after each start. This is done independently of how rich in contrast the image produced turns out to be. In particular, fingerprint images are also supplied whenever the finger is not yet correctly resting on the support surface of the sensor. It would be desirable, on the other hand, for it to be possible to operate the sensor in a fashion ensuring that complete fingerprint images are delivered only whenever a finger rests on the support surface such that a clear and contrasty image can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the present invention to specify a possibility as to how a fingerprint sensor can be used always to produce sufficiently contrasty images when a finger is rested on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved with the aid of a circuit arrangement having the features of claim 1 and with the aid of the method having the features of claim 2. Refinements follow from the dependent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The circuit arrangement according to the invention or the operating method according to the invention ensure for a fingerprint sensor that the fingerprint sensor is started automatically when a finger is rested on in such a way that a sufficiently contrasting image can be produced. This is achieved by virtue of the fact that test runs are carried out in the case of which only a portion of the pixels is taken into account, and the sensor signals determined are used to establish whether it is possible to achieve a sufficient contrast. The circuit arrangement according to the invention generates for this purpose the difference between a maximum and a minimum value of the sensor signals, for example along a column or a row of a matrix-like arrangement of pixels. If this difference is sufficiently large, which indicates a sufficient contrast of an image to be produced, the normal scanning operation of the fingerprint sensor with the aid of which complete fingerprint images are produced is started. This ensures that the complete fingerprint images produced are of satisfactory quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention therefore provides for determining contrasts within a previously selected group of pixels, and to initiate the production of a complete fingerprint image in the event of sufficient contrast.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A raster-shaped arrangement in the scheme of a matrix is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for the sensor elements of a fingerprint sensor. Sensor surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the individual pixels are located inside a region provided as support surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a finger. A column of pixels of this matrix is highlighted with a dashed line and two arrows <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the circuit arrangement according to the invention or the method according to the invention, the sensor signals of the sensor elements of such a column are determined in each case along this column in successive runs. The maximum and minimum values occurring in a run supply a measure of the achievable contrasts. If the difference between the maximum and minimum values overshoots a fixed value prescribed in accordance with the design of the fingerprint sensor and/or of the method, the driving of the sensor elements is modified such that it is no longer only signals of individual columns that are generated, but an entire fingerprint image is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The individual sensor signals of the pixels respectively evaluated in this form are generated in the same way as in the case of the taking of the entire fingerprint image. The sequence of the drive is modified in accordance with the invention by comparison with the sequence in the case of the taking of an entire image such that in each case only the pixels of a row, column, diagonal or similar selected group of pixels are detected, and their sensor signals are evaluated. Disregarding this additionally prescribable driving sequence, the drive circuit provided for this purpose can otherwise be designed in the way known per se for fingerprint sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a preferred refinement of a circuit arrangement according to the invention, with the aid of which the method according to the invention can be executed. A sensor signal determined in each case in relation to the respective pixel passes to the input <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the circuit. Located there is a circuit node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the aid of which the signal is supplied to two comparing elements <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. It is established in each case in these comparing elements whether the current sensor signal is greater or smaller than the stored maximum or minimum value. These stored values are located in a first and second memory register <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The value stored there is fed via lines <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the comparing elements and compared there with the current sensor signal. If it is established that the current sensor signal is, for example, greater than the stored maximum value, the first comparing element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated on the left-hand side in the circuit diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is used via an associated first control line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which leads to a first gate circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to accept the current signal, which is fed via the node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the gate circuits <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that are present, into the first memory register <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second comparing element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> correspondingly has a second control line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second gate circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The respective current minimum value is stored here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Subsequent lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are used to supply the stored values to one subtracting element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> each, which can, as indicated in the drawing, for example, be an adding element upstream of which there is connected on the side of the second memory register <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provided for the minimum value, a reversing element <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for the sign. The difference that is produced in the subtracting element is supplied to a third comparing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in which this difference is compared with a specific prescribed signal level <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Output at the output <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a control signal with the aid of which the complete production of the fingerprint image is initiated, and the difference between the maximum and the minimum values overshoots the constantly prescribed value. Present for respective subsequent runs are circuit parts <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the aid of which the contents of the memory registers are reset or erased. The minimum and maximum values are thus always detected only respectively for one run, that is to say for in each case exactly one interrogation of the sensor signals along a column or row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The evaluated pixels need not &lsqb;lacuna&rsqb; along a row but, for example, lie in that region of the sensor surface in which the method according to the invention supplies the best results. This can be a small section in the middle of a sensor surface. The method can be adapted to the respective circumstances and requirements by selecting the pixels to be detected according to the invention. </paragraph>
