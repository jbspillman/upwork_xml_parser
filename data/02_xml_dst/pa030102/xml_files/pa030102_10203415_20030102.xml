<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for the production of a cylinder block for an internal combustion engine for motor vehicle. More precisely, this invention relates to a method in which at least one cylinder liner is arranged in a mould and aluminium-based material is cast into the mould and cooled so that the cylinder liner is incorporated in the cylinder block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a known solution, the cylinder liners are made of cast iron, or other material, which melting point is considerably higher than that of the aluminium-based material forming the cylinder block. In this case, there is no risk of damaging the cylinder liners while casting the material destined, once solidified, to form the cylinder block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Technically more advanced solutions envisage the use of cylinder liners made of aluminium-based material, such as, for example, hypereutectic aluminium alloys or composite aluminium alloys reinforced with ceramic particles (silicon carbide, alumina, ceramic fibres, etc.). With reference to cast iron cylinder liners, aluminium liners present the advantage of being lighter in weight and permitting the construction of an engine which consumes less oil, because the aluminium liners have an expansion coefficient which is much closer to that of the aluminium pistons. For this reason, during operation of an internal combustion engine fitting aluminium liners, the variation in play between the piston and the internal surface of the respective cylinder liner is lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The production of cylinder blocks with cylinder liners incorporated by casting poses various problems. The cylinder liners usually produced by extrusion normally present an external layer of alumina due to the oxidation of the aluminium-based material in the presence of oxygen. A metallurgic bond between the cylinder liners and the cylinder block cannot be obtained if cylinder liners coated with a layer of alumina are incorporated in the molten material which is destined to form the cylinder block, because the alumina layer(which fusion temperature is considerably higher than that of the aluminium alloys) forms a barrier between the cylinder liners and the material forming the cylinder block. With the alumina barrier, the bond between the cylinder liner and the cylinder block is only mechanical, while a metallurgical bond concerning at least of a part of the contact surface between cylinder liner and cylinder block would be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The applicant experimented a method consisting in removing the alumina layer by turning immediately before arranging the cylinder liners in the mould. However, this method introduces an additional cost related to the turning process. Furthermore, experimental experience demonstrates that without the alumina layer the cylinder liners can be damaged when the molten material destined to form the cylinder block is cast. Specifically, the formation of localised fusion of the cylinder liners was found near the mould casting channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The purpose of this invention is to describe a method for the production of a cylinder block with aluminium liners which are not effected by said problems and which permits the creation of a metallurgic bond along at least a part of the contact surface between liner and cylinder block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, this purpose is reached by means of a method which characteristics are described in the main claim.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> indicates a cylinder liner according to this invention. The liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made of aluminium-based material, such as, for example, hypereutectic aluminium alloy, aluminium-based metallic matrix composite material, for example reinforced with ceramic particles or fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A plurality of protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which extend in the longitudinal direction for the entire length of the liner, forming respectively parallel and equidistant ribbings, are formed on the external surface of the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is obtained by means of extrusion according to a known method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The shape and dimensions of the protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are determined in such as fashion to melt when they come into contact with the molten aluminium at casting temperature (&cong;730&deg; C.). Preferably, each protuberance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> presents an undercut shape with a narrower section near the external surface of the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The purpose of this narrower section is to form a preferential fusion area from where the fusion of the projecting parts starts. The external surface of the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is covered by a layer of aluminium oxide which is formed spontaneously following contact with oxygen. The layer of aluminium oxide forms a thermal barrier which protects the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the risk of being damaged during the fusion of aluminium-based material in liquid state which is destined to form the cylinder block. The layer of alumina on the protuberances does not prevent the fusion of the protuberances because the contact surface of each protuberance with the molten material is extended and presents a fusion starting point which thickness is limited. When the protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are melted by the liquid material cast around the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the portion of the root, indicated with number <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is without the alumina layer and in correspondence to said areas a metallurgic bond is created between the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the aluminium-based material forming the cylinder block, indicated by number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically illustrates the contact area between a liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the material forming the cylinder block after casting and solidification of said material. The protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are indicated with a dotted line because the protuberances have melted in contact with the cast material. The dotted line indicated by number <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically represents the layer of alumina forming a protective thermal barrier between the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A mechanical bond will be formed between the cylinder liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, with an air gap which is smaller than 20 microns, in the area where an alumina layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is present. Conversely, a metallurgic bond without gap providing tight co-penetration of material is created in the areas where the protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> were present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The objective is to obtain a metallurgic bond between the cylinder liner and the engine crankcase during the casting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The geometry of the protuberances is such to ensure that when the protuberances come into contact with the molten aluminium they soften and deform. The aluminium oxide (alumina) present on the surface of the protuberances is fragile and cannot be deformed. Consequently, the alumina cracks and detaches by effect of this deformation. Consequently, the molten aluminium comes into contact with the aluminium alloy of the liner (underneath the oxide) which favours the formation of a metallurgic bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the overall surface of the areas in which the formation of a metallurgic bond is required is in the range from 5% to 50% of the overall external surface of the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, to facilitate fusion of protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, said protuberances have a height h included in the range from 30% to 60% of the thickness S of the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a narrower section which thickness t is included in the range from 40% to 80% of height h. The undercut shape of the protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is advantageous because a mechanical anchoring between the liner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is obtained if the fusion of the protuberances <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> does not occur. </paragraph>
