</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, a structure such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is known as a water pump for circulating cooling water in an automobile engine, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The water pump comprises a pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a mechanical seal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, sealing devices <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for the water pump bearing, a pulley <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, etc. The impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to one end of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is attached to the other end. The pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are rotated by a belt (a belt which transmits rotation of a crankshaft of an engine) which is wound around the pulley <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that cooling water in a pump chamber is sent out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is used as an inner race, and an outer race <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is externally attached to the outer peripheral face of the inner race via a cylindrical roller group <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a ball group <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> serving as rolling elements. The bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is disposed in a boss portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a pump housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The sealing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is disposed on the side of one end (on the side of the impeller) in the axial direction of the water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> performs a sealing action so that, even when the cooling water in the pump chamber leaks from the mechanical seal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the cooling water does not enter the interior of the water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the leaking cooling water to be discharged to the outside through a drain hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the boss portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The sealing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is configured by an annular seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and an annular slinger <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the sealing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fixed to a shoulder portion of one end in the axial direction of the outer race <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and, as enlargedly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, configured by integrally heat bonding an elastic member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in which two radial lips <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and one axial lip <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are formed, and which is made of synthetic rubber or the like, to an annular core <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By contrast, the slinger <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is positioned on the side of the one end (on the side of the impeller) in the axial direction with respect to the seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and externally fitted and fixed to the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The axial lip <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is in contact with a disk portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the slinger <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The two radial lips <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are in contact with the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the sealing device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is on the side of the impeller, the seal performance is improved by using the seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the triple lip type in which the two radial lips <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the one axial lip <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are disposed. However, the seal member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the triple lip type configured as described above has a complicated structure because it has the axial lip <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, thereby producing a problem in that the cost is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention has been conducted in order to solve the problem. It is an object of the invention to provide a sealing device for a water pump bearing which can exhibit excellent seal performance although using an economical seal member of a simple structure having no axial lip. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the object, the invention set forth in claim 1 provides a sealing device on a side of an impeller of a water pump bearing configured by using a pump shaft as an inner race, the impeller being attached to one end of the pump shaft, a pulley being attached to another end, and by externally attaching an outer race via rolling elements to an outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> the sealing device comprises: an annular seal member which is fixed to a shoulder portion of one end in an axial direction of the outer race; and an annular slinger having an inner cylindrical portion and a disk portion which is extended in a radial direction, the inner cylindrical portion being positioned on a side of the one end in the axial direction with respect to the seal member and externally fitted and fixed to the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> the seal member has a section shape which is bent along the disk portion of the slinger, and an outer cylindrical portion which is extended from an outer periphery of the disk portion toward the other end in the axial direction, a labyrinth seal portion is formed between the seal member, and the disk portion and the outer cylindrical portion of the slinger, and a radial lip is disposed on an inner periphery of the seal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the sealing device for a water pump bearing, the economical seal member which is not provided with an axial lip and, which has only a radial lip is fixed to the shoulder portion of the outer race. However, the seal member has a section shape which is bent along the disk portion and the outer cylindrical portion of the slinger, and the labyrinth seal portion is formed between the seal member, and the disk portion and the outer cylindrical portion of the slinger. Although an axial lip is not disposed, therefore, the labyrinth seal portion and the radial lip alone can exhibit sufficient seal performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As in the sealing device set forth in claim 2, the radial lip of the seal member may be in contact with the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, or placed in close proximity to the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft so as to form the labyrinth seal portion. Alternatively, as in the sealing device set forth in claim 3, the radial lip may be in contact with an outer peripheral face of the inner cylindrical portion of the slinger, or placed in close proximity to the outer peripheral face of the inner cylindrical portion of the slinger so as to form the labyrinth seal portion. In both the cases, excellent seal performance is exhibited by the radial lip and the formed labyrinth seal portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention set forth in claim 4 provides a sealing device on a side of an impeller of a water pump bearing configured by using a pump shaft as an inner race, the impeller being attached to one end of the pump shaft, a pulley being attached to another end, and by externally attaching an outer race via rolling elements to an outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> the sealing device comprises: an annular seal member which is fixed to a shoulder portion of one end in an axial direction of the outer race; and an annular slinger having an inner cylindrical portion and a disk portion which is extended in a radial direction, the inner cylindrical portion being positioned on a side of the one end in the axial direction with respect to the seal member and externally fitted and fixed to the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> the seal member has a section shape which is bent along the disk portion of the slinger, and an outer cylindrical portion which is extended from an outer periphery of the disk portion toward the other end in the axial direction, an expanded portion of an elastic member is formed in an axial direction of the bent portion, a labyrinth seal portion is formed between the expanded portion, and the disk portion and the outer cylindrical portion of the slinger, and a radial lip is disposed on an inner periphery of the seal member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the sealing device for a water pump bearing, the expanded portion disposed in the bent portion of the seal member can increase the distance in the axial direction of the labyrinth seal portion formed between the outer cylindrical portion and the expanded portion, and a process of bending a core constituting the seal member can be easily conducted. As in the sealing device set forth in claim 5, the radial lip of the seal member may be in contact with the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft, or placed in close proximity to the outer peripheral face of the pump shaft so as to form the labyrinth seal portion. Alternatively, as in the sealing device set forth in claim 6, the radial lip may be in contact with an outer peripheral face of the inner cylindrical portion of the slinger, or placed in close proximity to the outer peripheral ace of the inner cylindrical portion of the slinger so as to form the labyrinth seal portion. In both the cases, excellent seal performance is exhibited by the radial lip and the formed labyrinth seal portion.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a small-diameter portion and a large-diameter portion. The mechanical seal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed on the small-diameter portion, and the water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is disposed on the large-diameter portion. The impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to one end of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is attached to the other end. The pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are rotated by a belt (a belt which transmits rotation of a crankshaft of an engine) which is wound around the pulley <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that cooling water in a pump chamber is sent out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The mechanical seal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is configured by: an outer annular member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is internally fitted and fixed to a boss portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a pump housing; an inner annular member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is externally fitted and fixed to the small-diameter portion of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; a rubber sleeve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is externally attached to an inner peripheral cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer annular member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>; a rotary ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is disposed on a portion of the inner annular member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the side of the impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; a fixing ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is externally fitted to the inner peripheral cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer annular member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so as to be slidable toward the impeller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; and a coil spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is disposed in a compressed state on the outer periphery of the rubber sleeve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and which presses the fixing ring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> against the rotary ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The water pump bearing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a so-called integral shaft bearing, and uses the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an inner race. An outer race <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is externally attached to the outer peripheral face of the large-diameter portion of the pump shaft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via a cylindrical roller group <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a ball group <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which serve as rolling elements, and which are arranged in two rows in the axial direction.
