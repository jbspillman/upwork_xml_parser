<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a vehicle tailgate which has storage capacity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Automotive vehicles such as pick-up trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans typically include a cargo box defined by a generally rectangular area of the vehicle having a cargo floor, opposing side walls and a rear tailgate pivotally connected to the cargo floor. The tailgate may be pivoted about the cargo floor between an open position providing access to the cargo box area and a closed position, latched to the side walls, for closing the cargo box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Some vehicles are provided with a cover to completely enclose the cargo box for items to be carried in the box. These covers may have either a soft or a hard construction. The soft covers are not completely weather proof and can be easily infiltrated. The hard covers can be quite costly. Furthermore, the items to be carried may not be of a size to justify a complete coverage of the cargo box and it may be desirable to leave the top of the box open to carry larger items which extend above the height permitted by a full cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The height or distance from the ground to the cargo floor or tailgate often presents difficulties in loading cargo into the vehicle and cargo box. Many large sized vans or trucks such as &ldquo;moving&rdquo; trucks, include an elongated ramp which may be attached to the rear of the vehicle or cargo floor adjacent the opening to the cargo box and extended between the cargo floor and the ground to assist the vehicle occupant in loading the cargo box. However, storage of the ramp remains difficult due to the size of the ramp which must be long enough to provide a usable ramp angle for moving objects into and out of the cargo box. After use, the ramps are usually placed in the cargo box and in many instances because of their long length they extend out of the box. Furthermore, these known ramps must be very strong, which usually means they are also heavy, for loading the cargo box with larger items such as motorcycles, all terrain vehicles, etc. Again this makes the known ramps awkward to handle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a vehicle for storing and transporting cargo comprising a cargo box for supporting and storing the cargo in the vehicle. The cargo box is defined by a generally planar cargo floor extending between a front end and a rear open end of the box and a pair of spaced apart and generally parallel side walls extending between the front end and the rear open end along opposing sides of the cargo floor. A tailgate is operatively connected to the rear open end of the cargo box and pivotal between an open position extending from the cargo floor, generally planar therewith for providing access to the cargo box and a closed position extending generally upright from the rear open end of the cargo floor between the opposing side walls for closing the cargo box. According to the present invention the tailgate includes an item storage cavity and a door for closing the cavity in the tailgate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a stowable ramp assembly for a vehicle including a first ramp member having a first support surface and a wedge shaped profile. The first member has a leading end having an end wall extending from the first support surface. A pin extends transversely of the first member and is spaced from the first support surface. A second ramp member has a second support surface and a wedge shaped profile. The second member is configured to nest within the first member when in a front to back relation. The second member has a trailing end having an end wall extending from the second support surface and a hook extending longitudinally from the trailing end at a point spaced from the second support surface. The first and second members interconnect in a ramp configuration by engaging the hook about the pin and rotating one of the members relative to the other of the members until the leading end wall abuts with the trailing end wall presenting an elongate support surface. A first set of the first and second members store in a nested configuration with a second sets of the first and second ramp members also in a nested configuration. The first and second set are presented to each other in opposing directions to minimize the stack height of the ramp members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a well in a vehicle for storing a first set and a second set of ramp members. The storage well has a cover for selectively covering and closing the well. The well is sized to receive the first set of first and second members in a nested configuration and also a second set of first and second members again in a nested configuration. The first and second sets of ramp members are presented to each other in opposing directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the invention the well in the vehicle for storing the first and second sets of first and second ramp members is provided in the tailgate storage cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to yet a further embodiment of the present invention at least one elongated extension ramp is stowable within the tailgate cavity. The extension ramp includes a first end for connecting the ramp to the tailgate and a second end for supporting the ramp on a surface adjacent the vehicle whereby the ramp provides a gradual inclined extension support surface from the surface adjacent the vehicle to the tailgate for loading cargo into the cargo box.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Optionally and as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, air struts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be provided to extend between the cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the frame structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to hold the cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the open condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly is illustrated in a face down condition. First member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a generally rectangular shape in plan view. First member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a series of ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which extend the length thereof. Ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> taper in depth from a hinged end to a distal end. The hinged end has a depth approximating the depth of the well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> support a plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which has a series of apertures <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which are spaced to align with the spacers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The hinged end of first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is placed in the end opposite the spacers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly is illustrated in a face down condition. Second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has generally rectangular shape having a length less than the length of the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a width slightly less than the width of the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Second member has a pair of archways <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extending longitudinally. Archway <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are tapered. A surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> interconnects the archways <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> third member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly is illustrated in a face up condition. Third member is identical to second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and positioned in a face to face relation therewith. Third member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is positioned to rest upon the lips or flanges of spacers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The aperture pattern is such that two are positioned to rest upon spacers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and two rest upon spacers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the fourth member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly is illustrated in a face up condition. The fourth member is identical to the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The fourth member will nest over top of the third member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A feature of the invention which is specifically designed to help the nesting of the four ramp members is the configuration of the spacers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as earlier described. The location of the flanging of the spacers allows certain parts of the ramps to clear over the spacers to bottom of the cavity while other parts of the ramps engage the flanges to ensure that the ramps align properly with one another in the well. Further the flanges properly seat the ramps and prevent them from moving around within the tailgate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Since the two sets of members of the ramp assembly are tapered and in the face to face or back to back relation, the four members will stack utilizing approximately the thickness of either the first and fourth members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for storage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Thus the depth of the well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is determined by the thickness of the first or fourth members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Once the four members are placed in the well as described, the cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be closed to secure the members in place. The tailgate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be then used in the convention manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated, the four members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly are fabricated from a lightweight metal, such as aluminum. However, it is contemplated that other lightweight, high strength materials, such a long glass fibre reinforced plastic or nano-particle reinforced composite materials, may also be used. The dimensions of the ramp depend upon the load of the articles being transported along the ramps and thus well within the purview of those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the hinged end of first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the hooked end of second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The hinged end of the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending from side to side at the lower edge. Rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is connected to each of the ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and spaced slightly forwardly of the end wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. End wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from the support surface only part of the depth of the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, presenting openings <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> between the ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has cam surface extending about the rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a plurality of hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extending at the lower edge. Above the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is an end wall presenting abutment surfaces <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Each hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extends approximately 180&deg; so that any connection starts when the first and second members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are substantially perpendicular to each other. This feature minimizes the risk of accidental disconnection. Additionally, as the second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the hooks will engage the cam surfaces of opening <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to encourage positive engagement therebetween. The second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is pivoted about the rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> until the abutment surfaces <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> engage the end wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the ramp assembly is illustrated in the ramp configuration. The first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are hooked together in the elongated ramp condition. The second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is hooked onto the tailgate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the lip <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> abutting with studs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on the upper/trailing edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> positioned under the flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Once the third and fourth members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are installed in a similar fashion, the flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are closed and the ramp assembly of the present invention are ready for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the ramp assembly may also be stored or used in a box extending condition. The second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is applied to the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with one of the two in an inverted condition, the two members will rotate until the second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends perpendicular to the first member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The other two members <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are connected in a similar fashion. The side walls of the cargo bed are provided with clips <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which engage and secure the first <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and fourth <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> members to the side walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The lip <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided with a slidably mounted rod <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> having tabs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. Third member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a guide <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having slots <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with an aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Slide rod <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> interconnects with guide <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to secure second and third members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> together. Rod <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is inserted into the aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to secure the ramp assembly in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> shows another box extender assembly generally indicated at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. This box extender assembly comprises a pair of panels <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and another pair of identical panels (not shown on the figure). These panels could just as easily be stowable ramps similar to those earlier described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The pillars <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the cargo box include undercut pins <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which lock into undercut slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of panels <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to hold these panels with the sidewalls of the cargo box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Panels <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are hingedly connected to panels <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> so they form a connected right angle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>. Panels <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> include undercut pins <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> at their upper and lower edges so they like the panels <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are reversible in their direction of positioning. The edge of the tailgate includes undercut openings to receive the downwardly facing pins. It is also reinforced by an edge cover <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> having its own openings <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> which align with the tailgate openings to secure the panels across the back of the cargo box. The two panels <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> will interlock with one another using for example the earlier described slide interlock to hold the assembly together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 through 21</cross-reference> show another stowable ramp assembly according to an embodiment of the invention. This ramp assembly comprises a first long ramp <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a second shorter ramp <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Again both of these ramps have a wedge shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Ramp <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes a ground engaging end <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> which is angled to meet with a support surface without leaving a gap between the surface and the ramp. It also has a connecting end <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> having a pair of outer hollow tubular hinge pin receptors <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and a centre receptor <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Ramp <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> has a connector end <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> including pin receptors <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. These receptors align with the receptors of the longer ramp as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> to form a hinged joint <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> between the two ramps. This hinged joint is secured by a hinge pin <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this assembly the two ramps fold from an extended ramp forming position to a collapsed storage position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> with releasing from one another. Once again they are easily stowed in the folded position within a storage well, e.g. the tailgate, of the vehicle. The wedge shaping and the long and short lengths of the ramp members enables them to readily nest with another pair of similar ramp members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The present invention thus far has been described in terms of two ramp members to each side of the vehicle. However, it is now readily apparent to those skilled in the art that each ramp structure could be assembled with more than two members interconnected together with a series of hooks and hinges at opposite ends of intermediate members. The additional members could also be configured to nest for storage in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention has been described above with the storage well being integrated within a pick-up truck tailgate. It is now readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the storage well could be integrated in any suitable location on the vehicle including on the floor of the cargo bed. Additionally, the present invention could also be utilized with other types of vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it should be noted that even though in the description above the tailgate liner has been specifically configured to receive cargo ramps, this liner, as evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, can easily be replaced with a different liner configured for a different use. For example the tailgate can be used to receive fishing and/or hunting gear. The liner would have defined receiving areas for locking this gear in place in the tailgate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Note that the items described above are not large enough to justify a complete coverage of the cargo box. However, when using the tailgate these items are stored in an orderly manner and can be locked within the tailgate. The tailgate itself can be easily made weatherproof while leaving the cargo box available for transporting much larger items which do not need weather protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention a portion of an automotive vehicle, such as a pick-up truck, is generally depicted at <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> for storing and transporting various articles of cargo.
