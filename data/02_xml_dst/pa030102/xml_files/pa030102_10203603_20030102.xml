<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to pouring devices for containers and more specifically to spout attachments for liquid carrying containers which have an automatic opening feature through use of a spiraling cam depending from the cap and acting directly upon the fitment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pouring spout attachments have been used for cartons and particularly for liquid carrying containers. These attachments are typically mounted on the outside of cartons surfaces or have flanges which are secured on the interior surface of the carton and extend outward through an opening in the container sidewall. Several prior art patents disclose utilization of a pull tab for opening of this container spout. There are also push in tabs for weakened panel zones within the spouts for opening the container. Such spouts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,101,999 and 4,934,590. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Other patents are known such that the push-in aspect of the spout for opening of the container has a latch feature such that the push-in flap for the spout remains in the open position. Such a disclosure is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,833,112. A drawback to these prior art spouts is that they require user intervention for actual opening of the container separate and apart for opening the spout itself, traditionally through either a standard threaded closure or a snap on cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other prior art which automatically punctures or opens the container upon removal of the cap is found in the prior art. These structures however suffer from a drawback in that they require serrated or rough edges to puncture the container wall thereby possibly causing shards to appear in the contents within the container. Such a disclosure is contained within U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additional prior art spout fitments incorporate a third insert or blade which is acted upon by an extension of the cap. Inclusion of separate elements which are not integral with the fitment and which require assembly within the design increases the overall costs of production and assembly. Further, tolerance issues between the non-integral pieces may prevent the fitment from acting properly to open the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There does not exist in the prior art references an economical and easy to use automatic opening pour spout which attaches to a container such that the user, upon unthreading of the closure, causes the opening of the container without ragged tearing of the container side wall or creating chaff. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A general object of the present invention is to provide an automatically opening pour spout fitment wherein the user, upon unthreading of the closure, causes the fitment to puncture the container and allow the contents to be readily poured therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a pour spout fitment wherein user intervention is not required to puncture the container sidewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the present invention is to provide an automatically opening fitment wherein the auto opening feature provides downward force in a direction which is parallel to the bore of the spout of the fitment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic opening pour spout fitment wherein the puncturing apparatus does not cause tearing of the carton sidewall or generate foreign material within the container </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an easy opening fitment wherein even rotational pressure is required to open the container through use of the auto opening feature of the fitment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pour spout fitment wherein the rotational movement of the closure on the pour spout is converted to vertical pressure on the container to adequately open the container and fitment. It is further desirous to have the pour spout fitment remain in the open position once opened by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pouring spout fitment wherein the closure on the pour spout is threadably attached to the spout of the fitment and wherein the closure has a tamper indicating band or other frangibly attached indicator to indicate prior opening of the spout. Further, upon opening of the closure by the user, the tamper indicating band is fractured from the closure and the fitment pierces the container and opens it for dispensing of the contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and other objects heretofor stated are met by the automatically opening pour spout fitment of the present invention. The pour spout fitment of the present invention contains a spiral cam depending from the top wall of the closure which engages a cam follower on the hinged flap of the fitment. Upon rotation of the closure, the cam causes even pressure to be applied to the cam follower thereby applying vertical downward pressure on the flap and piercing of the container for opening thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> All of the above outlined objectives are met by the automatically opening pour spout fitment of the present invention described herein.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the automatically opening pour spout fitment of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. The pour spout fitment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is comprised of a threaded cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which threadably engages a fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As is commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art, the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is affixed to the sidewall of a container or other carton wherein upstanding sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment extends outward therefrom. Typically, below hinged flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is found a weakened portion of the container sidewall, the container not being shown in the figures. This weakened portion allows the flap to rupture the wall and open the carton when downward pressure is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is comprised of base portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and upwardly extending sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Extending upward from the hinged flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The design of the automatically opening pour spout fitment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is such that upon rotational movement of cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to remove the cap from the sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment, cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, extending downward from the top wall of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contacts cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> causing rotation about the hinge and opening of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With the design of the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the present invention, opening of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes first downard pressure to achieve tearing of the container and then rotational pressure so that the flap rotates about the hinge. Cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> initially operating on back surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in order to apply the downward cutting or tearing force. Continued turning of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes the spiral cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to pass upward along the back surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and in the last 90 degrees of rotation, in the third quarter turn, the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> acts vertically downward upon the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example, in the first portion of turning of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, i.e. first 180 degrees, the cam follower <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> contacts the vertical edge or back surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As the tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> approaches center of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e. it begins to move from right to left as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> due to the rotation about hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>), the spiral cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes over the tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and acts directly downward on the tip for final portion of the opening rotation. Horizontal action is therefore provided upon the vertical or back surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to provide downward tearing force on the container and then vertical action is provided on the tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cam follower to allow the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to enter through the torn portion and fully open the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Turning directly to the design of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the fitment is comprised of base <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which provides an affixation point for the fitment to the container. The base portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> may overlay the exterior of the container, may be integrated within the sidewall of the container or may be placed on the interior of the sidewall of the container with the annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending outward through an annular opening. In any design, a weakened section of the wall of the container is found directly below flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This weakened section is such that sufficient downward force on flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> causes the weakened section to rupture or tear and open the fitment for dispensing of the container through sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be of rectangular shape and provide sufficient area for affixing the fitment to the container. Annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends upward from the base portion <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and forms a pouring zone there through in order to dispense the contents of the container to which the fitment is attached. The fitment is additionally comprised of a plurality of notch apparatus <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> formed along the conjoining section of the annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as being separate by 90&deg; along the base of sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are positioned so as to contact similar notches formed on a tamper indicating band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which depends from a cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> will coact with these notches on the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the tamper indicating band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will rupture from the lower edge of the cap sidewall and separate therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> further contains at least one helical thread <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for threadably engaging the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Upon review of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is apparent that the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has formed within the confines of the pouring zone, defined by the sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> a flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is hingedly connected to the base <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> via hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is defined as a weakened area of the base portion along one segment of the flap such that the flap may rotate about the hinge line thereby entering the container and piercing the weakened portion there below. The flap further contains a cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which, as is seen in the Figures, has a slightly triangular shape and extends upward from the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is shown as being perpendicular to the hinge line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may generally be about 20 mm in diameter and is separated from the annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by a slight gap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This gap provides sufficient clearance for the annular flap to rotate about the hinge line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and move upward or downward through the pouring zone defined by the annular side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as described above, is shown as being perpendicular to the hinge line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in this example. The cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed slightly above the center line of the flap so as to provide a positive angle of attack and engagement via surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, as outlined above, against the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and its depending contacting driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Thus, with this particular design, the cam follower allows the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to provide initial downward force on the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated in the counter clockwise direction. Hinge line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> allows the flap to move downward when the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated thereby providing sufficient downward force to pierce the weakened container sidewall found below flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and then rotational force to allow the flap to fully open the pouring zone of the fitment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention which works in conjunction with the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is clearly shown with the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending away from the top wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is generally comprised of a top wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a sidewall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extending downward therefrom and a tamper indicating band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is frangibly attached to the lower edge of sidewall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Of particular importance in this design is the spiral cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which provides the downward force on flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has center post <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, extends approximately from the center of the top wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, spirals in a clockwise fashion from the center post and descends downward to lower portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The cam spirals from the center post <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to lower portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and has a contacting driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is defined by the width of the spiraling cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engages the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> found on flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is positioned slightly off of the center line of flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that it positively engages the driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The spiral design of the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> allows the cam to exert downward thrust onto the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along a horizontal plane. As can be seen from the Figures, the spiral cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provide a means to provide a downward driving force on the force concentrator which is initially parallel to the direction of the bore of the spout. In other words, the downward force is applied in a direction which extends through the pouring zone of the fitment. Such directional downward force allows the spiral cam design of the present invention to more particularly distribute the downward thrust of the cam as well as provide more leverage against cam follower by the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the spiral cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having depending driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> acts to drive the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along the rear vertical surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. By providing a spiraling depending surface or driving edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in conjunction with engagement surfaces <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the cam follower, horizontal and rotational pressure is applied to flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> ensuring that the side wall of the container located thereunder is adequately pierced by the flap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is further comprised of a tamper indicating band <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which detaches from the sidewall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the cap upon first removal of the cap. The tamper indicating band is provided with a plurality of notches <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which align directly with notch members <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> formed on the base <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The notches <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the cap receive notch members <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and prevent the tamper indicating band from rotating when rotational force is provided to the cap by the user. Thus, positive indication that the cap has been previously removed is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has been pushed downward after the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been rotated and removed from annular side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment. Reaching the end of its travel, cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown passing over the tip portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and has forced flap into the full downward position as shown. The flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has rotated about the hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which is more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is provided along a segment of the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is weakened line which, due to its reduced thickness, allows the flap to rotate thereabout. The hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be weakened sufficiently that it is less than one half the thickness of the remaining portion of the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> but alternative formations of an adequate hinge are well within the design capabilities of one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, after full counter clock wise rotation of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has contacted the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and forced the flap in the downward position. The contents of the container may now be dispensed through the pouring zone which is defined by the side wall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an alternative fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. In this alternative design, the fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with a stay open feature so that the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, when pushed in the downward position as was previously shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, maintains its open position allowing the contents to be poured from the container in routine fashion. The stay open feature of the fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is comprised of a shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which extends across the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> adjacent to the hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as can be more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, extends upward from the flap and rotates forward and downward about the hinge line <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> when rotational force is applied upon the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The downward movement of the shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> forces it into contact with the stop members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which extend inwardly from the annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> into the pouring zone. Stop members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as are seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, thereby engage the shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> aft(r it has rotated downward and, once the shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is forced past the stop members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, causes the flap to maintain an open position. Therefor, sufficient downward force upon the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided by the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during rotation of the cap such that, when the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has reached the lower portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> thereof, rotation of the cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the counter clockwise and opening direction eventually causes the cam to force the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> downward and the shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to by pass the stop members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Thus, even at this lower position of the cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, sufficient downward force is provided to snap the shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> past the stop members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> so that it maintains an open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While a first and a second stop member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are provided, it is readily apparent that unitary stop members or shoulder elements may be provided to sufficiently retain the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the open position. Further, alternative stay open features for retaining the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the open position after the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated in the downward direction about the hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are well within one of ordinary skill in the art to design and implement on the fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is the force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which extends downward from the bottom surface of flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, the force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is designed so that a slightly sharpened portion may extend downward from the flap and provide maximum concentration of force to initiate tearing of the weakened portion directly below the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> along the container wall. Force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, is slightly trapezoidal in shape but may alternatively be triangular or other possible designs. Force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends downward from the flap and, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> does not extend through the sidewall of the container below the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> upon shipment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in a slightly raised position allowing the force concentrating member to remain slightly apart from the weakened portion of the container sidewall. The hinge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the fitment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> allows the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to be rotated along the hinge in the upward and downward direction. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided so that, upon turning of the cap, which is not shown in these Figures, the cam contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> along the vertical surface <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>providing a horizontal force to act thereon pushing the force concentrating member downward against the weakened portion of the container. Force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is thus provided to allow for less downward force which enables the flap to fully open the container and tear the weakened portion of the container there below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the various positions of the flap during opening are shown. Initially, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the force concentrating member may be slightly above the weakened portion of the container side wall. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, as the cap is rotated in the counter clock wise direction causing the cam to act upon the top portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cam follower, the flap rotates downward causing the force concentrating member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to extend through the weakened portion of the container sidewall. Further, as the flap is forced downward, shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may contact stop member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and pass thereby. As the cam further rotates and forces the cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> downward even further, shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> snaps past the projections <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> due to this downward rotational movement. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the flap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is now maintained in the opened position allowing the contents of the container to pass through the opening and through the pouring zone defined by the annular sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fitment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While one embodiment of a cam follower <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in the Figures is described herein to work in conjunction with a cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> depending from a cap top wall to engage said cam follower, it will be obvious to those of skill in the art that variations utilizing a spiral cam and cam follower can be incorporated in the herein disclosed automatically opening pour spout. The cam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the present invention, which depends from top wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, may be varied so as to properly contact the cam follower and provide sufficient downward force so that the flap penetrates the sidewall of the container. While the embodiments shown herein work sufficiently to provide such downward force, other modifications thereof are possible and within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
