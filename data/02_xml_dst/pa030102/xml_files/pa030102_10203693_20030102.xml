<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Electric drive units are used in diverse application fields; for example in the motor vehicle field, various movable parts of the motor vehicle (seats, window lifters, sliding sunroofs, etc.,) are operated by means of electric drive units. Electric drive units consist of an electromotor (i.e. electric motor) (for example a direct current motor) for generating and providing electrical drive power, and of an electronic module for controlling/driving and monitoring the electric motor (for example for the rotational speed and power regulation of the electric motor), as well as for the realization of additional functions, as the case may be. For carrying out the movement of the drive shaft of the electric motor, there is provided a transmission arranged in a transmission housing, and the electric motor is connected in a suitable manner with the transmission. An electrical connection is required between the electronic module and the electric motor for further conveying sensor signals and control signals, as well as for the voltage supply. In connection with a direct current motor as the electric motor, for this purpose, the collector or commutator of the electric motor is connected with the electronic module, which is arranged on a carrier body (for example a circuit board). Typically, the electrical connection is realized via connection lines embodied as a cable, which connection lines are connected by means of connector plugs to the plug connections on the electronic module housing and the electric motor housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In this context it is disadvantageous that this connection between electric motor and electronic module is complicated and costly, and gives rise to problems with respect to reliability, aging, etc., and necessitates a high surface area requirement, so that the installation volume of the electric drive unit is large and the production of the electric drive unit is connected with relatively high costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object underlying the invention is to propose an electric drive unit that comprises advantageous characteristics in comparison to the above, especially a simple construction and low costs, a high reliability, and a simplified manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved according to the invention by the characteristic features of the patent claim 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Advantageous embodiments of the electric drive unit are the subject matter of the further patent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Electric motor and electronic module form a drive unit that is integrated in or with the transmission housing, especially the connection between electric motor and electronic module is realized in the transmission housing via contact elements (for example press-in contacts) arranged on the brush rocker or bridge, whereby the contact elements engage into corresponding contact points on the carrier body of the electronic module (for example into through-contacts of a circuit board). For contacting the electric motor, two contact elements (press-in contacts) are required on the commutator of the electric motor, and therewith on the brush rocker, and consequently two corresponding contact points are required on the carrier body; however, more contact elements (press-in contacts) may also be provided on the brush rocker and therewith also more corresponding contact points can be provided on the carrier body, whereby number and arrangement of the press-in contacts on the brush rocker and therewith also number and arrangement of the corresponding contact points on the carrier body are selected dependent on the characteristics of the electric drive unit, especially dependent on the current requirement of the electric drive unit or the required current carrying capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Recesses for the electric motor and the electronic module are provided in the transmission housing on its front side (end face side), especially, a first recess is provided for the drive shaft, the commutator, and the brush rocker of the electric motor, and a second recess is provided for the connection part of the electronic module comprising connector plug contacts. Drive shaft, commutator, and brush rocker of the electric motor are inserted into the first recess in the transmission housing in such a manner, so that the electric motor housing which encloses closes the rotor (armature) of the electric motor lies flushly on the transition housing. The electronic module is introduced into the transmission housing from the upper side of the transmission housing, whereby the connector part of the electronic module is inserted into the second recess in the transmission housing and the carrier body of the electronic module, with the aid of guides applied on the interior wall of the transmission housing, is positioned in such a manner, so that the carrier body is arranged parallel to the bottom side (to the base surface or to the floor) of the transmission housing and thereby its upper surface normal vector or axis extends perpendicularly (at an angle of 90&deg;) relative to the axis of the drive shaft of the electric motor and the contact points on the carrier body of the electronic module come to rest on the contact elements (press-in contacts) arranged on the brush rocker. By the application of pressure, for example by means of a press, the contact elements (press-in contacts) are connected with the contact points (for example the press-in contacts are pressed into the through-contacts of a circuit board), whereby electric motor and electronic module are electrically connected with one another. For protection against environmental influences or for stability reasons, a housing part (embodied as a lid of the transmission housing) can be arranged as the upper or top side of the transmission housing and hereby a closed transmission housing can be realized. The securing of the electric motor housing on the transmission housing, and therewith the mechanical connection between electric motor and transmission (transmission housing) is achieved by of suitable securing elements, for example via screws inserted into corresponding bored holes in the electric motor housing and transmission housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the electronic module, there can be arranged several functional units arranged on the circuit carrier in a compact construction: for example a power unit with power semiconductor components, a control/driving unit, an anti-interference unit for suppressing the effects of the commutation processes of the electric motor (brush arcing) as well as the connector part with the connector plug contacts. Preferably the electronic module comprises at least one rotation speed sensor (for example a Hall sensor) for detecting the rotational speed of the electric motor, which sensor can be positioned at (any desired) suitable place on the carrier body; especially the rotation speed sensor is positioned on the carrier body in such a manner so that a sufficient coupling is provided to a transmitter or emitter applied on the drive shaft of the electric motor, for example a sufficient magnetic coupling of a Hall sensor to an emitter magnet applied on the drive shaft of the electric motor. The dimensioning of the carrier body (of the circuit board) is guided by the number of the components of the electronic module, and can be optimized in accordance with the surface area required therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Due to the realization of a very short internal electrical connection between electric motor and electronic module, separate connection lines are omitted, and also the problems connected herewith (space requirement, reliability, costs, etc.); therefore, in the integration of electric motor and electronic module in a compact electric drive unit, only small installation volumes are necessary and good electrical characteristics, a high reliability and a high operating life are ensured.</paragraph>
