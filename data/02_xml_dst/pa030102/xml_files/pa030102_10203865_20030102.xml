<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When a device, e.g., an electrical appliance, fails or appears to fail, the operator of the appliance typically requires &ldquo;support&rdquo; from qualified technical personnel. Several types of support are typically used today: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (a) the operator carries the device to a service station (or sends it by mail); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (b) a service technician arrives to check the device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (c) The operator contacts a hot line (or reads a manual) for receiving telephone (or email) instructions for diagnosing and/or repairing the device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (d) the operator contacts a service center (manual or automated) via the Internet; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (e) for software &ldquo;devices&rdquo;, a remote login program, such as PCAnywhere can be used to allow service personnel to log into the computer on which the software is executing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Network management, for example, automatically monitoring which devices are active and which devices are faulty, is known. However, such management does not include servicing the faulty devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As technology progresses, more manufactured devices include embedded controllers that execute embedded software. Such devices typically use complex algorithms and do not include moving parts and/or clear displays for simple diagnosis by a lay-person. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the invention, an automated maintenance network is provided, for remotely maintaining software embedded devices and/or guiding operators in their maintenance of the devices. Optionally, the maintenance network is hierarchical and/or includes components that specialize in particular maintenance problems and/or devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;maintaining&rdquo; refers to support activities that relate to failure states, for example, including the prevention, avoidance, diagnosis and/or solution of failure states in a device. A failure may be caused by internal and/or external agents, for example, due to wearing out or failure of components, incorrect design, use outside of design specifications, bad input of data or instructions and/or malicious activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to an automated, and optionally centralized maintenance server. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the automated maintenance server performs one or more maintenance related tasks automatically. Alternatively or additionally, one or more tasks are performed semi-automatically, for example, requiring user approval for some activities (e.g., especially non-reversible ones), using human resources to perform activities on a device and/or passing difficult situations to a human for analysis and/or solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, however, the management of the tasks associated with a failure state is performed automatically and optionally at a location remote from the device and/or outside of the device itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the automatic server performs, for example, one or more of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (a) send commands and/or scripts to the embedded controller to perform diagnosis activities; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (b) send commands and/or scripts to repair software and/or hardware problems and/or to configure the device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (c) send commands and/or scripts to test susceptibility of the device to various actions; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (d) send commands and/or scripts to perform periodic or sporadic preventive maintenance activities; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (e) copy device setup, software and/or patches, between two or more devices; send commands and/or scripts to test susceptibility of the device to various actions; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (f) apply cross-testing between devices, for example to detect possible failure modes by comparing the responses of different devices to a same or similar test; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (g) gather, collate and/or compare operational statistics, failure statistics and/or cause-effect patterns within or between devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Optionally, one or more of the above tasks is performed by a site server that is located near the maintained device, for example connected by a LAN to the device. Alternatively or additionally, the task are performed by a dedicated agent embedded in the device or associated with the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the management function is separate from the data storage and/or the maintenance performance functions. For example, the management function can include one or more of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (a) monitoring that a maintenance process is being carried out according to plan; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (b) taking note of the effect of a maintenance task; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (c) selecting among different possibilities (e.g., automatic decision making); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (d) modifying a maintenance process; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (e) distributing work between components for the maintenance process (e.g., data analysis may be performed by another component, with only the results used for management of the process); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (f) setting parameters for a maintenance task; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (g) time management (e.g., making sure maintenance is happening within a required time schedule and/or re-scheduling, skipping and/or adding steps); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> (h) trading off between the usage of resources by multiple maintenance processes; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (i) ensuring that various maintenance-related goals (e.g., down-time, failure rate and/or cost) are met or approximated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a communication protocol between the server(s) and the device(s) uses a standardized format, so that a plurality of devices, configurations, device makes, device versions and/or device manufactures can be supported by a small number of maintenance servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to a maintenance method in which a device to be maintained actively seeks its maintenance, optionally seeking management of maintenance activities by an external servicing server. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the active seeking can be limited to checking if the external servicing server has any maintenance related request and/or data. Alternatively or additionally, active seeking includes one or more of the device requesting assistance, the device requesting bids on maintenance and/or the device sending out a data package for analysis at the maintenance provider. Optionally, the device includes one or more timers or event alerts that are used by the device to determine if periodic maintenance is required. Optionally, one or more of these activities are performed by a component associated with the device, for example, a site server. In some embodiments of the invention, the device (or an associated agent or site server) cannot know for sure that maintenance is required, for example, in case of externally timed periodic maintenance or when the an occurrence of a failure event is determined by remote analysis of data exported by the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a publication agent is provided in association with the embedded device, for providing data from the device to a servicing server. In some exemplary embodiments of the invention, the publication agent selects the data to be uploaded to the server. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, such a publication agent allows a device to communicate with the server in an off-line connection, rather than using an on-line connection. Alternatively or additionally, fewer connections between server and device are required than without such a publication agent. Alternatively or additionally, there is less interference with the operation and/or timing of the embedded controller. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more pre-defined data profiles are provided. Different such profiles may be associated with different failure events and data based on the profile sent when a failure is detected. Alternatively or additionally, a user or the device or a site server can request transmission of such a predefined data set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a communications server is provided to allow components that are within a firewall to interact with components outside the firewall (and possibly in a different firewall). In one example, the components connect to the communication server using an unblocked protocol, for example HTTP. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the connections are used to poll and/or to write to mail boxes, associated with other components of the network. Alternatively, the mail boxes may be located at the servicing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the data and/or problem complaints of a device are exported by the device, for remote analysis. Possibly, such exporting reduces the amount of communication overhead, the number of live connections and/or enhances privacy and/or security of the devices and/or the device operators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the data for a device is exported only once from the site of the device, as a complete data set, rather than as a series of responses to request for data. However, a complete data set is exported, including, for example a complete log and/or a plurality of device state vectors. This may allow interactive data acquisition to be avoided or reduced. Alternatively or additionally, the device behavior is analyzed at the server, using the data as an input to a model of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to automated log analysis, as an aid to maintenance of a device. Such maintenance may be local or may be remote. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the log includes internal devices states, for example recorded by hooks in the device. Optionally, analysis includes detecting a pattern of states and/or state changes or durations that indicate an upcoming failure state. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the automated analysis includes comparing logs of different devices. Alternatively or additionally, new data is acquired for one or more devices, for comparison to earlier acquired data and/or model data. Alternatively or additionally, the log of a device is analyzed to detect possible reasons for failure. Alternatively or additionally, the analysis is for detecting decline (and potential future failure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, log analysis includes comparing multivariable logs from the same or different devices, across normal and faulty states. Optionally, the analysis includes detecting near-faults (e.g., suspiciously high CPU usage) which can indicate imminent faults (e.g., missing a response time limit to an event). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, patterns of faults, near faults and tracked variable patterns are used for diagnosis or predicting fault situations by pattern matching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the devices are periodically polled. When the polling shows suspicious data, a logging is initiated and/or enhanced (e.g., by changing the parameters logged and/or the logging resolution). Alternatively, the devices (or a local site server) may view the logs and/or the polled data to determine if logging should be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The log may be organized and/or accessible in various ways, for example as data fields (e.g., each representing a tracked variable), as events (e.g., to which a response includes a change in logging) and/or as state vectors (e.g., set of parameters that describe the state of the device being logged). The contents of the log (e.g., which data is logged and/or which events recorded) may be decided a priori and/or may be set by the events that occur and/or by the maintenance server. The log may include, for example, state vectors prior to a failure, during a repair process and after a repair process. The data for the log may be, for example, periodically acquired, acquired when it changes and/or more densely acquired before, during and/or after important events. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, data is acquired at a high quality and some of the data is averaged or discarded when it is determined that no noteworthy event occurred and/or as memory fills up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The log may be provided to the server in real-time and/or after the fact, for example, at a delay, periodically and/or as a function of the size of the unsent log. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to user controlled privacy in a servicing network. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a user can set the degree of access, of other parts of the servicing network, to data and/or instructions of the devices associated with the user. Optionally, the user sets the privacy level via a site server associated with a site at which the device is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the device seeks maintenance and the maintenance process is managed by an external entity. However, actual application of some of the maintenance-related tasks and/or analysis if the results is performed by a site server, with only the results being provided to the remote manager. Thus, sensitive data can remain at the user site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to updating real-time software on the fly. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, executing software is patched, for example by replacing one or more instructions, functions or data elements of the software. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the updating is performed at a time when it is expected that the software will not be executing the particular updated code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an agent determines, before patching, that a patched location is not going to be in use for a while and/or that patching will not affect currently running tasks in an undesirable manner (e.g., causing a contradiction). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, such determination is made based on execution patterns of the device, for example, that after calling a function &ldquo;A&rdquo;, a function &ldquo;B&rdquo; is usually called only after a few seconds, so function &ldquo;B&rdquo; can be patched. Determination that a function is called may be achieved, for example, by hooks in the function or by activating a time based interrupt. Such execution patterns may be determined, for example, by analyzing logs from the same or from other devices. Alternatively or additionally, the effect of changing the code is estimated based on the effect of such a change in other executing devices, with similar state vectors (e.g., sets of parameter values). Alternatively or additionally, the code is clanged when the state vector is similar to or the same as a vector at which it is known that such a change in code has no adverse effect and/or has a desired beneficial effect. It is noted that the experience from other devices can be used to estimate (e.g., by the server or agent) not only when to make changes in code, but also possible long term effects of such changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the code that is updated is the code of one of the maintenance related agents and/or watchdogs and not the operational code of the software. Alternatively or additionally, patches to the operational software may be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to learning, by a maintenance server and/or one of the agents, parameters of a new supported device. Such parameters being learnt may include, for example, the operational properties of such a device and/or typical failure modes. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, at least some rules describing the expected failure modes of such a device are provided by the manufacturer and/or by a human technician, during at least some of the servicing sessions for the device. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the failures and/or behavior of a plurality of similar devices are used by the server to learn faster what to expect from the new device. Possibly, such learning also includes classification of device properties and/or configuration parameters that affect the failure modes, for example, for a refrigerator, the location relative to inside or outside walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to generating a fault specific display for a maintenance viewer. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, data that is received from a device is analyzed, for example using a set of data analysis rules or other equivalent means, to determine which parts of the data are of interest. Interest can include, for example, the data indicating the fault, being affected by the fault or causing (or indicating the cause) the fault. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a display to a user is generated to focus on the interesting information, for example graphing the information or by modifying the relative resolution, screen space and/or accessibility afforded different parts of said data. Optionally, additional data is acquired to supplement said display. Optionally, the display is selected from a set of predefined display formats. Alternatively, an ad-hoc format is generated, for example, a graph that shows variations in value of a device parameter over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> There is thus provided in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a method of device maintenance, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> determining that maintenance should be performed on a target device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> automatically selecting a maintenance process including at least one maintenance task to effect said maintenance; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> automatically managing said maintenance process on a maintenance server separate from said target device, said maintenance server adapted to manage maintenance processes for a plurality of devices, said managing including at least monitoring the execution of said process; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> automatically performing at least one said maintenance-related task to effect at least a portion of said maintenance of said target device. Optionally, automatically managing comprises automatically recording an effect of said maintenance process on said target device. Optionally, automatically managing comprises modifying said maintenance process by said maintenance server in response to said effect. Alternatively or additionally, automatically managing comprises controlling a time duration of said maintenance process by said maintenance server. Alternatively or additionally, automatically managing comprises generating a series of maintenance tasks by said maintenance server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, at least two of said plurality of devices are located at a same site. Alternatively, at least two of said plurality of devices are located at different, unassociated, sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, at least part of said maintenance server is located at a same site as said target device. Alternatively, at least part of said maintenance server is located at a different site from said target device. Optionally, said maintenance server and said target device are separated by a firewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, said maintenance server comprises a centralized server. Alternatively, said maintenance server comprises a plurality of distributed components. Optionally, said plurality of distributed components is arranged in a hierarchical structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, said determining is performed by said maintenance server. Alternatively or additionally, said selecting is performed by said maintenance server. Alternatively or additionally, said performing is performed by said maintenance server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, at least one of said performing, said selecting, and said determining is performed by at least two physically separated components that cooperate as a distributed system. Alternatively, each of said performing, said selecting, and said determining is performed by a non-distributed component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, said determining is performed by said target device or a dedicated agent associated with said target device. Alternatively or additionally, said performing is performed by said target device or a dedicated agent associated with said target device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the functions of site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are carried out by the devices themselves and/or by components inside or outside of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example instead of site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or as a backup to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Optionally, user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes network management services (NMS), for example as a separate NMS server <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, or integrated with site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is implemented as a Java program. Alternatively, it may be a standard program, for example, executing under the Microsoft Windows operating system. Other components of network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be implemented, for example, as standard compiled code (e.g., C&plus;&plus;), as Java or other network code and/or as application specific add-ons, for example, implementing a viewer (described below) using a WWW browser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the user site includes a service server, such as viewer (e.g., manual or expert, described below) or an AI server, to assist in performing local maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Internet </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, Internet <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> includes a communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for managing and/or monitoring communications between user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, Internet <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> includes a connection to another service source <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, for example, one that is not behind a firewall. Possibly, user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can select different devices to be serviced by different service providers and/or be allowed to bid between service providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is used as a WWW server to present information to a viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> integrates information from multiple locations, for example, allowing an operator (e.g., at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) to view failure statistics of a particular device installed at multiple user sites. Alternatively or additionally, other information may be displayed, for example, a vendor&apos;s frequently asked questions list, information from network management systems and/or device updates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Service Site </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes one or more service servers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, that respond to and/or initiate service activities. Service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> can provide one or more of manual servicing, manually-mediated servicing and automated servicing. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an optional manual viewer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is used for manual servicing. An optional expert viewer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is used for manually-mediated servicing. An optional AI (artificial intelligence) server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is used for automated servicing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is run by a manufacturer of devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is run by a service provider. Alternatively, server site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> distributes servicing work between multiple servicing providers. Possibly, a service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> determines the manufacturer of the faulty device and forwards the request for service to an appropriate server or service site. Alternatively or additionally, such redirection may be practiced by communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Optionally, site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes a customer resource management tool <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, which may be integrated with service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Such a tool may be used, for example, to track the usage and distribution of the manufacturer devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes an R&amp;D viewer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, in which R&amp;D personal of the manufacturer can analyze service needs and use the information for future designs. Alternatively or additionally, this viewer is used as a test location for various device updates and/or for remotely controlling testing of new device versions at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Examples of use </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a washing machine. Site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, for example a home automation computer, schedules periodic maintenance (e.g. ten consecutive clear water washes after every 2000 gallons of water pass through the machine) for device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A problem is detected in device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during the maintenance (e.g. variations in wash cycle time). Site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> uses communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to forward a request for help to service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> forwards the request to AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, which generates an appropriate response. A response back to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, is for example, to log more data or to have the water filter checked (e.g., by a human). Possibly, additional logging will determine the variation is synchronized to time of day, and the cause might be simply variations in water pressure. Alternatively, additional logging may determine that it is the spin cycle that is varying in duration, indicating a possible friction problem. Possibly, the further analysis is managed by service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and/or by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In another example, device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a router, which provides a fault alert to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The response of service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a patch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In another router example, a router user changes the configuration of the router at night and causes a problem that only shows up during peak traffic hours of next evening. When the fault is detected, the servicing provide checks the configuration history of the router and resets the router to a previous configuration that worked. Such setting may be manual or automatic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> One advantage of a router is that, as a networking device it is naturally connected to networks. Another advantage is that a router may include available memory and/or CPU power for various uses, an appliance, may be more limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Communication Protocol </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> While any known communication protocol may be used, for example, a direct connection, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and/or service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are protected by a firewall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and/or a firewall <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, respectively. Such firewalls may block normal communication methods, such as most direct connections. Direct connections may be undesirable for the reason that they allow the propagation of viruses, access to devices that are not being maintained and/or invade the privacy of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an intermediate component (e.g., site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) is placed intermediate the device and the service server, for example, to filter the passing data and requests. Alternatively or additionally, no direct connection communication method is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a mailbox based communication configuration <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which can be used to bypass firewalls. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a flowchart of a method of communicating using the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the communication out of the firewall uses an HTTP protocol for sending a request and for retrieving files (responses) from mailboxes. Alternatively, other protocols that work through a firewall may be used, for example SNMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> A device (e.g., device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) generates a fault condition (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). Site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> writes a request to a mailbox <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>), in response to the fault. Service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> periodically polls a mailbox <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, associated with it on communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and retrieves the request (<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). After handling the request, service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> places the response in mailbox <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). Site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which polls mailbox <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> reads the response (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) and acts on it (<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). Although two mailboxes are shown, such a protocol may be implemented with a single mailbox or with multiple mailboxes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the mailbox system is used as a relay, for example, for providing SNMP, Telnet or other protocols over the mailbox protocol. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the messages in the mailboxes are protected, for example, using an SSL secrecy method. Alternatively or additionally, the messages are limited to be from a set of message types, for example, &ldquo;instruction to log&rdquo; and &ldquo;problem announcement&rdquo;. Alternatively, the content of the messages is interpreted by the respective servers, and there is no limitation on their content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the different communicating parties are authenticated to prevent spamming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an administration function is provided, to allow an administrator to log on to communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and view, reorder, insert or delete messages from the mailboxes. Optionally, communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> imposes a quota (e.g., on size of log files) and/or can send messages of its own, for example, requiring a server to increase its mailbox polling rate, so that the server&apos;s mailbox is not too full. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Various types of physical networks may be used for configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for example, dial-up, satellite, e-mail, RS-232, radio, wired networks, Internet and/or off-line connections (e.g., diskette passing). In addition, hybrid networks, including multiple different segments may be supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the various elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> cooperate to emulate a virtual service network, which interconnects devices, various servers, human maintenance personnel and/or servicing providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the interconnected components include multiple human persons, located at remote locations and working on a same device or family of devices, for example, a first team testing a device in a laboratory and a second team, at a user site, which is attempting to debug the same device as being tested in the library. Alternatively or additionally, the network may interconnect various experts and/or different expert programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Privacy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> While, in some embodiments of the invention, the servicing will be provided at site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, in other embodiments and/or in difficult faults, servicing from outside site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be required. Typically, a user will not desire that an outside entity, no matter how trusted, will have too much information about the user site and/or an undue ability to affect the user operation. These limitations on privacy may be desirable at various hierarchical levels (in a hierarchical support network). Optionally, several of the levels in the hierarchy can define privacy setting protecting it from higher, lower or same-level members of the hierarchy. Alternatively or additionally, the device itself can be configured to allow a certain access level. This configuration may be pre-programmed or it may be set, for example by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> A first solution, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, is to fake some of the information sent out of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that the actual happenings remain secret, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> (a) insert spurious service calls, for real or fake devices; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> (b) fake log entries; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> (c) change log data; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> (d) use fake device ID numbers; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> (e) using a single device ID, a larger &ldquo;pool&rdquo; of device IDs, or fewer than all real device IDs when sending data or making a request; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> (f) filtering out (e.g., by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) of the traffic, for example, incoming requests and/or outgoing data; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> (g) collating multiple service request or data outputs into single files, where appropriate; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> (h) changing the temporal distribution of requests, data reports and/or the order of messages from different devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a doctored set of data is maintained in user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example, for providing data when diagnostics are executed by a remote service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, the servicing may be performed off-line, so that the operation at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be minimally affected by the servicing. Optionally, device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is disconnected from linked devices, to reduce access of the service provider to user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, only some information is sent out of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example, without device IDs, without geographical location and/or without an identification of the user site (e.g., to prevent a manufacturer from stealing clients of an appliance salesman). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may be limited in the type of request that it may make of devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, for example, limited in the fields of a log file, limited to certain log file formats, log file lengths, auxiliary instructions and/or number of devices it can access and/or be prevented from sending an automatic patch. Possibly, the hiding of information may take the form of encapsulation of part or all of the configuration at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or by not responding, for example, by blocking responses or by the components at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> not generating a response at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Although the settings of the privacy/access levels may be provided by service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or by a third party (e.g., at installation or purchase), in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an operator at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has control over the privacy policy. Various methods of defining privacy levels for networked elements are known in the art and may be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, four levels of privacy may be set for different devices: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> (a) no access; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> (b) allowed to get (e.g., some or all parameters); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> (c) allowed to set parameters (e.g., of agents) and/or give instructions; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> (d) bridging allowing a full diagnostic protocol, for example, Telnet, for example, being emulated over a mailbox communication protocol as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Different service sites and/or service providers may be allocated different permission levels. Alternatively or additionally, different devices, even in a same user site may have different access permission levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a diagnosis process includes executing previously successful and previously failing data sets on a device. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the selection of data sets, execution and determination of failure is performed by a trusted site server, so that only an indication of failure or other neutral information, such as relative processing rate, needs to be provided to an external entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Servicing Stations and Locations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The actual servicing of a faulty device can include one or more of the following activities: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> (a) giving instructions to a human operator; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> (b) automatic, temporary or permanent updating of software on the device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> (c) instructing one or more devices to collect data and/or perform acts; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> (d) analyze fault symptoms and/or logs; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> (e) managing a diagnosis and/or repair session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> These activities may be performed at one or at several places, even for a single fault and/or repair session. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, some or all of these activities are performed at a single servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a network of sites, possibly with overlapping capabilities, are provided. Alternatively or additionally, a hierarchical setup of servicing sites may be provided, for example, with the most difficult problems being forwarded to a particular sites and/or with different sites specializing at different problems. In a hierarchical setup, some service servers may be in a position to both generate and/or forward requests to higher level servers and to perform (or forward) actions they are required to by such servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the servicing sites are protected by firewalls. Alternatively at least some of the servicing sites are freely accessible on the Internet or via another communication network, for example, integrated with communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In some cases, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> acts in a distributed manner, in that one component of configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> uses a second component of the configuration, for example, for data acquisition (e.g., site server uses agent) for data retrieval (e.g., site server uses support server) and/or data processing (e.g., agent uses site server to analyze data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Site Server </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may provide a lowest level of servicing-related management, for example periodic maintenance, detecting faults, managing agents that are embedded in devices and/or emulating an agent. Alternatively to managing at least part of the maintenance of the local devices, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may treat each new communication as unrelated to previous communications regarding a particular device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be programmable by remote servers, for example, to manage a servicing session. Such reprogramming may be achieved, for example, using scripts, configuration files or by providing patches or replacement code for server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Often, a user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will prefer to have local servicing attempted before going for outside help. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> uses rules to analyze logs and data from devices and/or to determine timing for periodic maintenance. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> downloads these rules form service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> provides various relevant links to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, for example, FAQs, software updates and/or corrective procedures. Optionally, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> controls the timing of updating of local rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, same sets of rules are provided to site servers at different user sites <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, different sites servers may be provided with different rules, for example, responsive to the type of site and/or the type of maintenance and/or reliability solution favored by the individual site. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> performed the adaptation of the available rule sand information for each site server. Alternatively or additionally, to providing rules, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may provide data collection profiles, for example, for specific faults or for periodic retrieval. Such a profile can include, for example, the parameters collected and the method of collection (e.g., logging, polling). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Alternatively to a separate site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be distributed between different devices or embedded in one of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Service Server </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may distribute servicing requests among multiple servicing stations, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The management of a particular device problem request may be passed on to a different server or it may be managed by servicing server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, each communication from the device is treated as a separate activity by servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Optionally, each such activity utilizes a device file that is updated with the last servicing activities of the device. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, servicing server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> translates between one or more instruction protocols used by the servicing stations or protocols for receiving data from devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> In one example, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or servicing server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and/or the individual servicing stations can interact with multiple agent types and/or data retrieval protocols, for example, agent mediated logging and capture, Telnet, SNMP and polling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Manual Viewer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> may include a manual viewer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that is used by a human operator to provide service. This and the following described viewers may also be provided at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Optionally, the viewer is implemented using a browser at the viewing station. A WWW server may be provided, for example, at service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a design tool is provided for defining displays for a manual viewer, for example, a tool for building a graphical user interface. Alternatively or additionally, a tool is provided for browsing devices on the virtual servicing network, for example, using a hierarchic arrangement. Alternatively or additionally, a tool is provided for managing an agent on a device (or an agent shared among devices), for example, setting hooks in the agent (described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Expert Viewer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Expert viewer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be designed for a better qualified operator. Alternatively or additionally, such an expert viewer may have additional analysis tools and/or the ability to compare different devices and/or user sites. Expert viewer station <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also include computer-assisted abilities, for example, the ability to select and apply data logging and analysis scripts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, when a viewer station receives a data set, the data set is displayed in a manner that indicates problems. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a plurality of analysis rules is applied to the data to detect faults, inconsistencies and/or problematic values. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the indication is color coded, for example, to indicate thresholds that are passed. Alternatively or additionally, the display is adapted to focus on the cause and/or indication. For example, if the analysis rules determine that a data rate parameter has a bad value, the display will show a graph of the data rate parameter. Optionally, associated (e.g., effecting or affecting) parameters will be shown as well. Alternatively or additionally, warnings and/or error messages will be shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the viewer station sends a request for more data collection, for example, to enhance data in the display and/or based on an identification of useful data by the data analysis rules. Optionally, the viewer station can request an update or an original data set, of a predefined or of an ad-hoc collection of parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> AI Server </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is used to automatically manage and/or perform at least some of the servicing and/or diagnosis activities. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes a learning module, for example a rule based module, a learning by example module or a neural network, to facilitate such learning. Possibly, a plurality of AI servers are provided, with different ones having different capabilities, for example, only a basic automated servicing component being provided at user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (which may be integrated into a single component) cooperate in the following manner. When a request is received, if the request can be handled automatically, its is handled by AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, it is forwarded to a suitable human operator (or a remote, more advanced or specialized AI server). Possibly, some requests that could be handled automatically are handled manually, for example, if the request include such an indication, based on a service plan of the requester and/or based on availability (e.g., load balancing between different service providing components). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> As noted above, user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (and/or an unrelated remote site) may also include a viewer or an AI server, for example, to support local maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Agent </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, four types of agents are shown. Device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> does not require an agent, for example, the device supporting polling reading of data. Device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> uses an agent emulated by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has an embedded agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, for example as described in the above referenced application filed on even date as this application, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes an external agent <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, for example, for devices where an internal agent cannot be installed. Intermediate implementations are also contemplated, for example, some of the agent residing in the device and some residing (or being emulated) in site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or in a separate unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> A potential advantage of an agent (which may also be provided, to some extent by a site server) is providing maximal flexibility in defining, modifying and applying data acquisition. The presence of an agent allows, in some embodiments of the invention, data to be logged even if there is no real-time connection to a maintenance provider and also allows logging and/or data storage to be adapted to the instantaneous condition of the device. By downloading a suitable script to the agent, some pre-maintenance activities, such as testing the effects of various patches, may be applied as well by the agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing parts of an agent (e.g. agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) that may be integrated into a device (e.g., device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, such integration is achieved by providing the agent as software on a CPU of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Possibly, the agent is a separate, generic, set of routines. Possibly, the agent interacts with device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via hooks and/or by inserting instructions into a command stream of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, at least one hook is active at all times, to ensure that control transfers to agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, at least periodically. The various elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, may be divided up differently, for example, combining two or more elements into a single element, splitting up of an element, adding elements and/or omitting one or more element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an optional hooking control <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for managing hooks. Alternatively or additionally to pre-designing the embedded software in device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for remote maintenance of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a stand-alone hooking control agent is provided, which may be provided as an add on (e.g., separate process) or integrated with the embedded software (e.g., as part of the operating system). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the hooking control handles data acquisition and/or translating remote commands and/or scripts into location activity, for example by executing suitable software routines. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a hook comprises a section of software including a conditional test, which, if it succeeds, calls a &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; function. The hooked function can perform various activities such as data collection and variable setting. Optionally, the condition includes checking a list of activated hooks. Alternatively, a hook may be implemented as a software patch that replaces existing software, with a call to the hooked function. Other hooking methods and methods of interacting with embedded software are known in the art and may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> An optional log storage <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is used to store logged data. Alternatively, data may be transmitted out (e.g., to site server <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> or external agent <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) as soon as it is acquired. A local storage is especially useful when a collection assignment is given to agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, for example from site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or from servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, local storage may be used when a connection fails or is limited in some manner (e.g., limited bandwidth). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, storage <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> includes non-volatile memory, so that pre-crash data can be retrieved after a crashed device is restarted. Optionally, agent <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> detects an impeding crash and stores useful information and/or logs in the non-volatile memory. Alternatively or additionally, pre-crash information may be stored by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Optionally, device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes a watchdog control <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that monitors the operation of the device and warns of potential future failures, expected failures and/or undesirable commands from the operator. The watchdog may be updated, e.g., from a servicing server with state vectors and/or event sequences that were found, on other devices, to be indicative of (or cause) a potential failure. Like hooking control <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, watchdog <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be an integral part of the operational software used to perform the functions of the device, but is preferably, at least in part, separate. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, following an alert by the watchdog, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may request a diagnosis by a service site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, when watchdog <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (or site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) generate an alert, the alert may be displayed by device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, for example, if the device includes a suitable display. Alternatively or additionally, the alert may be displayed on an associated device, for example, a nearby device or on site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other alerting means, such as a pager, may be used. Alternatively, the alert may be forwarded to a servicing provider, and a suitable warning message returned, as a response from the servicing provider, for display by device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or by other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Optionally, agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a patch element <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, for patching of software of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, patch element <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> replaces real-time software of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, on the fly, when execution is not at the patched location. Optionally, agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or a more central servicing provider keeps track of the effect of patching the software at different software conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Optionally, agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an activation element <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, which may be used to activate certain functions of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, for example, functions or parts of functions that are usually activated by a user or by special conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is used for real-time diagnosis of device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, with various instructions being provided to agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the results of carrying out the instructions being transmitted from agent <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Such instructions may include, for example, testing (e.g., patching or activating), repair (e.g., patching) and logging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Data Storage </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Various types of data may be stored on virtual service network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, including, for example, one or more of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> (a) device configuration profiles and instantaneous state; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> (b) log files and other data collected from devices, for example by polling, such as performance, configuration and internal variables; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> (c) log file formats; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> (d) maintenance and/or test instructions; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> (e) scripts, for example, for carrying out testing, maintenance, data collection, configuration setting and/or software repair; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> (f) pre-failure profiles; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> (g) diagnosis and/or repair instructions; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> (h) replacement code; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> (i) maintenance sequence state (e.g., step in a maintenance instruction sequence); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> (j) symptom listings; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> (k) fictitious setups; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> (l) device files, including, for example, logging of support activities and predefined log file formats; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> (m) billing information; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> (n) a log of all the events that occurred at the service network (e.g. logging of all the communications so that a user and/or service provider can check that a service level agreement is met). Possibly, the data pertaining to a particular user site is available to that user on request, for example as a query from a central database. Optionally, automatic analysis tools for determining that a service level is met are provided, for example at viewer stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The various data may be stored at a central location, for example, in service server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a distributed database model may be used. However, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, some of the data may be stored at other places, for example locally where it is generated or used, for example, for preserving privacy, for enhancing retrieval time and/or for providing locally personalized views of the data and/or servicing network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In a particular example, an agent associated with a failing device may transmit a log file including additional information so that the servicing server that analyses the fault condition is not require to continuously communicate with the device. This may also allow the communication to be essentially off-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a hierarchical distributed database is provided by the various components of configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, data from a device is stored at site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Some of this data or a link to the data (which is stored at site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) is forwarded to service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> with a request for maintenance. Additional data may be requested from the device by a viewer station and stored at the viewer station. A link to the data may be stored in a device file maintained at service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. When an AI server requires for analysis, the server can follow the links and requests the relevant data from wherever it is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, by forwarding links to data rather than data, the data for a device may be managed separately form a repair process, which, for management purposes may only require a link to some of the data. As noted herein, an actual maintenance process may include contribution from multiple components, each of these components may be forwarded a list of links to the data and the components only request the data that they need. Some data may be stored at multiple locations, for example, for backup purposes, for speed of retrieval and/or for preserving privacy by minimizing request for data from &ldquo;private&rdquo; components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> R&amp;D Integration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the process of providing servicing is integrated with an R&amp;D process. Such integration may include, for example, utilizing the servicing network to try out new ideas. Alternatively or additionally, the integration includes using the servicing information to direct R&amp;D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the invention, the integration is used to assist debugging where the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is elusive and is not repeatable in a laboratory. By linking laboratory workers and field workers that view the same or similar device, finding such a bug and determined why the bug was not repeatable, can be achieved. Such linking may allow a same test to be executed on the two devices. Alternatively or additionally, such a test may be used to determine or enhance the repeatability of a bug that is discovered in a laboratory or in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> For example, the integration may include one or more of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> (a) Bug (e.g., design flaw) distribution tracking. For example, for determining relative occurrence, criticality and/or other statistical parameters of faults. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, devices may be put on notice (e.g., via agents or site servers) to log information and/or track the occurrence and/or the effect of a bug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> (b) Version testing. For example, determining the usability and/or relative value of new versions of software. Such monitoring can also include monitoring of the usage of new features, even if they do not fail or cause faults. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> (c) As an input for assisting in detecting design flaws. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an engineer on R&amp;D viewer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can analyze various problems that come up, to determine if they are caused by a same source. In a particular embodiment of the invention, such an engineer may initiate cross-device testing to attempt to verify that the design flaw exists and/or has a particular cause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> (d) cross-device testing. As a plurality of same or similar devices are being monitored by a single entity (the network) it is possible to run various test scenarios on multiple devices, for example, to uncover device flaws and/or to determine device longevity statistics. Alternatively or additionally, such testing may be used to compare different versions, for example versions under development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Maintenance Possibilities </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to apply various types of maintenance. The type of maintenance actually provided may depend, for example on cost considerations, privacy considerations and/or ability to interface an agent with the device to be monitored. While automatic maintenance is often desired, in many instances, manual and/or manually mediated maintenance may be better, more cost-effective and/or required in order to provide information into the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, human input is used to provide the maintenance, for example, to provide user-specific or vendor specific data analysis and/or repair rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, human performance is periodically compared to automated performance, for example, to detect desirable advances in programming or in training. Such comparison may include automatic tracking of performance and generation of a report to a human operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that many, but not all, maintenance functions require a significant amount of data transmission and/or level of details of data exposed (or used in other ways). For example, mere statistics of overloads in a router may be insufficient for maintenance, even if sufficient for network management (e.g., when should a new router be bought). Instead, an actual log of the various events may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Preventive Maintenance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, preventive maintenance includes testing and/or modifying a device not in response to, but in anticipation of a failure state. Preventive maintenance may be applied, for example, when a waning situation occurs, for example, strange sounds from a washing machine, which may be detected by a person. Alternatively or additionally, preventive maintenance may be applied periodically, for example on a regular schedule, such as based on device usage, time of year, time of day, device age and/or device wear level (e.g., as determined in a test). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, testing includes logging current parameters in a device. Alternatively or additionally, testing includes logging while performing a special task, for example, an empty wash. Alternatively or additionally, testing includes instructing the device to collect a log over a considerable period of time. Optionally, the items to include in such a log are selected based on one or more device specific characteristics that might effect the probability of an error state occurring. Alternatively or additionally, testing includes periodically polling for SNMP or Telnet data and analyzing trends or executing built-in tests of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, preventive maintenance includes performing acts that are expected to prevent future failure states. Possibly, data collection is accomplished during these tests, and analyzed to assist in anticipating future failure. Such analysis may be general or it may be limited or more detailed on parts of the log that relate to expected failures. Exemplary preventive acts include running a washing machine on multiple empty washes (e.g., to remove soap deposits), instructing a person to perform an act (e.g., replace a gasket), reformatting a disk, performing self-calibration, reacquisition of data, such as environmental parameters and/or a network neighborhood and clearing storage (e.g., an associative cache or a history folder). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, such preventive maintenance (and/or other maintenance as described below) utilize a separate software or hardware unit that instructs a user to operate the device and/or itself operates the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the results of such preventive maintenance and/or testing are used to generate a statistical model of expected failures for the device. Such model may be used, for example, by a manager of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example to plan in-depth device maintenance or spare parts purchases, and/or by service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, for example, to suggest support packages and/or to determine the requirements for future support facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, management of preventive maintenance, includes deciding the period of maintenance and/or what maintenance to apply, viewing the results of tests applied during and/or after the maintenance and/or deciding on further maintenance based on the results. Optionally, a device record is maintained (and referenced to for automatic decision making) showing what preventive or other maintenance the device had and/or expected operational parameters and/or usage parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Avoidance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used to help avoid fault situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> In one example, periodic testing results may be use to modify acceptable threshold in a device. For example, a router may be set to only accept a bandwidth lower by 10% that would otherwise be acceptable. Commands that exceed the threshold may be rejected by the router. A router may be programmed (e.g., by parameter change) by remote. Alternatively, the application of thresholds is by an embedded agent or by modifying the software of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, to setting thresholds, one or more alert situations may be defined to match expected pre-failure profiles. When such a pre-failure profile is detected, an alert is generated. Optionally, an operator (or an automatic controller) may reduce the load, shut down and/or perform another preventive activity on the device. Alternatively or additionally, the alert is used to execute a script, for example, an in-depth logging and/or analysis script. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Avoidance activities may be matched, for example, to device age, determined failure rates (e.g., as a function of various input parameters to the device) and/or a usage profile of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, management of the avoidance process includes checking if the desired fault was actually avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Diagnosis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, diagnosis is achieved by applying a series of tests and monitoring the effects of the tests, for example, by logging or polling for data. Alternatively or additionally, diagnosis is achieved by analyzing pre- and/or post failure logs. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, diagnosis includes determining which of a plurality of fault states is occurring, for example, there may be 3, 10, 20, 50 100 or any larger, smaller, or intermediate number of fault states to diagnose. Alternatively or additionally, the fault diagnosis may be continuous (e.g., percentage of overload). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the diagnosis may be based on one or more tests applied to the device (e.g., 2, 10 or 15 tests). Alternatively or additionally, the diagnosis is based on the analysis of one or more logs, for example, 2, 3 7 or 10 or any smaller, larger or intermediate number of logs. Such a log may include one or more records, for example, 10, 100, 1000 or any smaller, larger or intermediate number of records. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the analysis is directed to the behavior of the specific device. Alternatively or additionally, the analysis is directed to the behavior and/or failure of other, possibly similar, devices. Alternatively or additionally, the analysis is directed to the current behavior of other devices, achieved, for example, by applying a test diagnostic to multiple other devices, possibly at different user sites, by coordination of one of the components in configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may request that servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> obtain test diagnostic results from 5 other devices, either from storage or from current behavior, for analysis and/or comparison purposes. This can allow a diagnostic method to obtain a base-line for faulty and/or normal behavior in cases where no such base-line is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the log analysis is by comparing the log (or other acquired data) of the failed device to historical values and/or default values of this or other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, an analysis of at least some logs is entered by a human. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In an example of an automated analysis, when a log for a fault is acquired, the acquired log is compared to stored logs. A match between the log and the previously analyzed logs may be used to diagnose a fault. Further, a recommended second test or repair process may also be associated with the analyzed logs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the analysis of a log includes determining a pattern of internal device states and/or state transitions. Such a pattern may be indicative of ongoing problems, such as thrashing, or upcoming problems, such as running out of buffer space. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, acquired logs are processed into meta-logs, in which states, parameter value changes and/or other information is filtered out, for example, to assist in later comparison of this log to other logs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, to analyzing internal states of the device, trend analysis and/or rule analysis are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a user or a vendor can define analysis rules, for example rules to discover inconsistencies in the logged or otherwise acquired data. An exemplary user defined rule includes a relationship between logged values that is expected to be maintained. Such inconsistencies may assist in diagnosing a fault and/or in predicting that a fault is likely to occur in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, especially for mechanical devices such as a washing machine, diagnosis utilizes various sensors embedded in the device. Such sensors may be in-built, for example for use of the device programming (water temperature, water level). Alternatively or additionally, new sensors may be provided for the diagnosis, for example, external to the device. Alternatively or additionally, a human operator may apply the sensors and provide the measurement results, possibly synchronized to the time line of the log. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, management of the diagnosis process includes determining if the diagnosis is correct (e.g., if the repair works or the fault repeats in a predictable manner). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Repair </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the repair of a faulty device is achieved by providing instructions (e.g., via e-mail, telephone or a display of the device) to an operator that mechanically manipulates the device. Optionally, once the operator manipulated the device (e.g., replaced a card), the servicing network is used to reprogram the device and/or calibrate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a &ldquo;repair&rdquo; comprises a recommendation to the user to replace the device or to enhance the network. Such a suggestion may also include a model number of a new device to purchase and/or a special offer. Optionally, the suggestion is targeted (e.g., by CRM <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>) based on previous purchases and/or usage profile of the device and/or the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, a software patch may be provided. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the patch is personalized for the device and/or device history. Optionally, the patch is selected and/or personalized (e.g., various parameters set) based on logging data from other devices where the patch was installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the patch is installed while the device is operating. For example, when a section of the device code is not in use, it may be patched. Optionally, the experience with other devices is used to determine during which state vectors of the device it is safe to make a patch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, to patching software, a device configuration, device code and/or parts thereof may be copied between an operating device and a malfunctioning device. Optionally, service site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> manages software updates and/or patches to the various maintained devices, so as to maintain a pool of at least one exemplary device configuration and/or programming, so that it can be copied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, repair instructions (or other instructions) include a conditional script to site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, for example, so that site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can select a particular repair based on an instantaneously logged variable in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the repair includes switching the device to use a redundant hardware or software sub-component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that unlike a mere software update process (e.g., as found in automatically updating software), in a maintenance process, it is not clear, ahead of time, what maintenance-related instructions will be provided. Fr example, a maintenance process may include a test instruction prior to deciding what and if to update. In addition, some types of maintenance are fault directed, in view of an existing or an anticipated fault. In addition, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, maintenance instructions are generated per device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Maintenance Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary maintenance process (based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generates an alert that a possible fault condition occurred. The alert is received by site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and forwarded to servicing server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens a &ldquo;fault record&rdquo;, including a link to data logged by device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and selects an initial diagnosis process. The link may include, for example a file name stored at site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or a time stamp. Server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> uses AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to analyze the data and generate a list of possible fault states, optionally including additional recommended test. Based on the contents of the list, server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> selects further tests to be applied. Possibly, an iterative process of acquiring data (possibly directly to AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>), optionally applying a test and then analyzing the data to select new data to be analyzed, is performed. Alternatively, a pre-existing diagnosis process may be tailored, for example, changing the settings of one or more tests and/or selecting which tests to omit (or add) based, for example, on cost or probability (of the tests identifying the fault). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Once the fault is diagnosed, server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (or AI server <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>) selects a list of possible repair procedures, for example, alternative patches or configuration changes for device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Possibly, server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> tests a plurality of repair procedures to determine which one is best. For example, a repair may be applied, a test performed and then the repair undone. Comparing the test results may assist in selecting the final repair method selected. Optionally, one or more long-term checkups are also performed, for example, to see if the repair took and/or was useful in the long run. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Optimization of Maintenance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, goals may be provided to the maintenance process as a whole. For example, one goal might be to reduce down-time due to faults and/or diagnosis. Another goal might be to reduce preventive maintenance costs. Another goal might be to reduce the availability of expenditures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> Optionally, when maintenance is performed and/or scheduled to be performed, the goals are considered when setting various parameters (e.g., frequency of testing) and/or selecting between possible repairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, device failure statistics will be available, at least after a time. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, these failure statistics are used to optimize the maintenance performance and/or planning, for example, using well known optimization methods, in order to meet the above goals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Additional Functions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> maybe used for non-maintenance activities as well. In one example, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used to acquire usage statistics, for example for aiding the manufacturer in determining if the devices he sells are used as planned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used for providing and installing software updates. Such updates may be provided to a device, for example, in response to a statistic (e.g., average) of failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used for device configuration management (e.g., via site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or servicing server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, device updates are selected in view of previous patches and/or fault conditions experienced by the devices. Thus, some devices may not be updated, or some features not updated, to avoid a future fault state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used in conjunction with help desks, for example, allowing a help desk operator to determine that an instruction he gave was correctly performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used for debugging the operation of devices that affect other devices, for example, load distribution servers and other devices that execute resource allocation protocols. In such devices, failure may be caused by an unsuitable distribution, rather than by real trouble with a device. Typically, the device causing the problem is not the device that has a failure. Such linked failure may also be caused by failure of the causing device to properly execute its tasks (e.g., a &ldquo;real&rdquo; failure). In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, such linked failures are analyzed by linked logging or data collection form a plurality of devices. The logging may be linked, for example, by a central server (e.g., site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) or by messages between the devices (or agents thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> Possibly, however, the privacy methods described above still apply (for the various non-maintenance activities above), so that the help desk is not aware, for example, of the location of the device and/or the data entered into the device. Instead, the agent may provide only an indication of the command performed and its execution result (e.g., fail/success). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of a method for setting up data logging, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. At <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a user of user site <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> logs into site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as a local user. At <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the user views a list of devices. At <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the user selects a device to manage and at <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the user selects the manage function. At <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the user selects a predefined logging profile to act out. Such a logging profile can be infinite or it can be limited (e.g., time or data limited). A user can define a new logging profile or change an existing profile, for example, for repeated or long term use or for a one time use. A similar process is optionally used to stop logging and/or to requests that a log file be stored, deleted and/or forwarded to a different location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of a method for reporting a problem, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. At <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the user logs in. At <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> the user selects a device to report a fault on. In some cases, the device will pop up (or will be in a special list) when the user logs in, for example, if the device initiated a fault report and/or if site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or a different component detected or suspects a fault. At <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the user selects that he desires to fill out a problem report form, to be filled out at <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, some of the fields will be pre-filled and, optionally, unchangeable. Alternatively or additionally, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will suggest fill-in data or provide it, for example, logged data. At <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, a new data collection task (e.g., logging or another method) is generated and carried out as result of the report. Possibly, the user tracks the logging and/or the analysis of the logging. Alternatively or additionally, the problem report is sent to a different component of configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, such a problem report is used to prompt long term logging and log analysis of this and/or other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> When a device is removed, the various components of configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are optionally informed. In some implementations, only site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will be aware of the device&apos;s existence. A similar process may be applied when a new device is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> When a new device is provided in replacement for an old device, the old device operational logs may be associated with the new device as well, for example, so that a comparison can determine if faults of the previous device were caused by the device or its use or its environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, when a new device is provided and/or a new type of device is provided at a site, the site may download information about the specific device and/or device type from servicing site <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively or additionally, a process of Darwinian learning may be initiated, for example, to determine at which device states it is permissible to patch the device software and/or activate various hooks in the agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Automation Level </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Different implementations will utilize different automation levels or a mixture of automation levels. For example, the maintenance may be completely automatic, possibly basing changes in maintenance schedule on an analysis of data from a test of the effect of changing such a schedule. Alternatively, some human interaction may be allowed, for example, a human may be require to mediate for some devices. Alternatively or additionally, a human may assist in complex analysis and/or in devising repair. Alternatively or additionally, a human approval may be required for carrying out some repairs. Optionally, even if an automatic action is performed, a human is informed of the action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> The automation level may varied also for safety reasons, for example, automated diagnosis may be allowed for medical installations, but not automated repair. Statistics on the quality of the repair work that are collected by configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to determine which types of activities may be manual and which may be automatic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Billing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Various charging schemes maybe used to receive payment for the use of the expertise in the various support stations. First, the various software and/or hardware components may be sold and/or licensed. Alternatively or additionally, requests to servicing server may be billed to a user account, for example, based on IP, hostname and device ID. Other charging schemes for services, as well known in the art may be used, for example, base on length of stored logs and/or other quotas. However, in many situations the user site will not want to report the site specific configuration. In such a case, site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (or communication server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) may strip identifying information from the request. The billing may then be on a request basis and/or on a response time basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> In some exemplary embodiments, a user site is provided with reductions in cost for service, for example, if the user site allows information gleaned from maintenance at the site to be shared and/or if the site may be used for testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> Alternatively or additionally, the billing may be locally managed via site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which server reports the billing charges to a remote computer, for charging purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The above servicing network has been described in general and with some reference to particular applications. It should be appreciated that such a network may be applied to all types of embedded devices that can connect to a communication medium of any type, including, for example, public (e.g., Internet) and private computer and data networks, telephone networks and wireless networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> In one example, the supported device is a cellular network, including the fixed components and/or the mobile components. Alternatively or additionally, the devices are components of a telephone routing network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> In another example, the devices are components of a computer network (e.g., computers, routers, hubs, printers and/or storage devices). It should be appreciated that various parts of configuration <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (e.g., the agents and the communication protocol) may be embedded in operating systems and/or hardware of the maintained devices. Possibly, at least some of the devices are &ldquo;pure&rdquo; software devices, for example, application programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Another example is home automation, alluded to above, where site server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> maybe a central house automation computer and the devices that are being maintained (including reminders for personal maintenance) are various appliances and/or the house itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Another example is Java machines, for example cellular telephones and home appliances, to which a suitable agent may be downloaded via communications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> An example of devices that need to be protected from outside influence and/or may require privacy protection are medical and industrial workshop networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the above-described methods of maintaining and supporting devices may be varied in many ways.
