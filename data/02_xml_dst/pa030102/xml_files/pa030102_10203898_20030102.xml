<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> THIS invention relates to a modular container for the storage or display of articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Numerous containers that are folded and erected from blanks of sheet material are known. Many of these containers may be collapsed when not required and stored as flat sheets, ready to be re-erected when needed. Some of the containers of this type may be connected to one another in side-by-side relationship or in a stackable orientation. Many containers that are arranged in this manner have tabs projecting from the walls of the container, which may be glued to another identical container. Once glued these containers are not easily separated without damage being inflicted to the container walls. Accordingly, it is difficult to repeatedly erect and collapse such containers after they have been joined to other containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Certain containers known to the art incorporate engagement tabs which pass through co-operating slots of another like container, or several containers are arranged in an overlapping relationship. However, such arrangements do not provide adequate coupling of the containers and containers that are joined together in this manner are typically prone to separation. Alternative means for connecting containers are known to the art, whereby co-operating connecting tabs may be inter-linked to connect containers together, but such linkage formations are not particularly strong and may be damaged easily with repeated use. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> wherein the front container connecting tab of an erected container may selectively be folded to engage in the front tab-locating aperture, or to engage in the front container-locating aperture of the second container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Typically, the end container connecting tab is formed from the inner portion of the tab-locating aperture provided in the end panel, which is partially cut out, whereby the end container connecting tab is foldable at or about the first common edge to selectively be positioned either in or out of the tab-locating aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The front and end panels may be provided on the first or the second side panels, or on the base panel. The upstanding edges of the front and end panels of an erected container must be connected to the side panels, either by being provided on at least one of the side panels and being connected by complemental tab and aperture formations to the other, or by being connected by complemental tab and aperture formations to both side panels. Preferably, the front and end panels are formed from two panels, provided on the first and second side panels, which are joined to each other by complemental tab and aperture formations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable that front and/or end reinforcing panels are provided on the base panel. These reinforcing panels may be formed of outer and inner panel portions, which are folded over the respective front and back panels, thereby enveloping the joins formed from the tab and aperture formations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A modular container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The container is formed from a unitary blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of corrugated polymeric sheet material. The container is intended for the convenient storage or display of articles, and may easily be erected to form a single container, or may simply be adapted to be joined to other like containers. The containers joined in this manner may easily be separated again to form single containers, or may be collapsed back into flattened blanks for convenient storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show the blank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has a base panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and opposed first and second side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extending from the sides of the base panel. When folded into a vertical orientation, the first and second side panels form the side walls of the container. On the side panels are provided respective first and second end panel portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are foldable from the first and second side panels respectively. The first end panel portion has a projecting tab <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is engageable with a corresponding aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed in the second end panel portion. When the projecting tab of the first end panel portion is engaged in the aperture of the second end panel portion, the end panel of the container is assembled, the end panel being shown generally as reference numeral <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Located on the other ends of the first and second side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided first and second front panel portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the first front panel portion having a projecting tab <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is engageable within an aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> formed in the second front panel portion. When so engaged, the first and second front panel portions form the front panel, shown generally as reference numeral <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An end container connecting tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is partially cut out of the first end panel portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fold between the first side panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the first end panel portion forms a hinge <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for the end container connecting tab, enabling the end container connecting tab to be positioned in a tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or folded out therefrom. Similarly, there is a front container connecting tab <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed out of a front tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the first front panel portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The front container connecting tab may also be positioned in or out of the front tab-locating aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Extending from the base panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there is provided an end reinforcing panel, shown generally as reference numeral <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which comprises an end outer panel portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and an end inner panel portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. There is a corresponding front reinforcing panel, shown generally as reference numeral <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which comprises a front outer panel portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a front inner panel portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> clearly shows the end and front panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in assembled configuration, with the projecting tabs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> engaged in the corresponding apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The end reinforcing panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is then folded from the base panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such that the end outer panel portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> abuts the end panel. The end inner panel portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is then folded over the end panel, thereby enveloping the end panel together with the engaged projecting tab and aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A projecting tongue <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided on the end inner panel portion, which is positioned in a complemental slot <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> cut out of the base panel. Similarly, the front reinforcing panel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is folded over the front panel to envelop it, and a projecting tongue <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> engages a complemental slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> provided on the base panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When a single modular container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is required, the end container connecting tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is positioned within the tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The engaged tab and aperture is then enveloped within the end outer and inner panel portions <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in this configuration there are no tabs projecting from the modular container and no slots or apertures are visible when the container is erected, as is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Should it be desired that a second container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be connected to the first container then, prior to the end and front reinforcing panels <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> being folded over the end and front panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the end container connecting tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the first container is folded out externally from the tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to project from the first side panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The second end panel portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of each container is provided with a container-locating aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, formed adjacent to the second side panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The size and shape of the container-locating aperture is configured to be identical and complemental to the tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed on the first end panel portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Prior to the end and front reinforcement panels <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> being folded over the end and front panels <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the end container connecting tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the first container is positioned into the container-locating aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the second container. This is clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. When the end container connecting tab is engaged in the container-locating aperture, the end reinforcing panel may be folded over the end panel into the assembled position. If a further container had been required, the end container connecting tab <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the second container would have been folded out from the corresponding tab-locating aperture <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to project away from the second container prior to the end reinforcing panel being placed in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The front container connecting tab <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be connected in a similar fashion to a front container-locating aperture <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed on the front panel portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The front reinforcing panel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> could then be folded into the assembled configuration in a similar manner to that described in relation to the end reinforcing panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this manner it is possible to cover all of the interconnecting tab and aperture formations formed on the blanks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whether they are connected to form a single modular container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or a plurality of containers connected in side-by-side relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the drawings, it is preferred that the front panel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is of a lesser height than the end panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This enables greater accessibility and visibility into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, partitions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, having co-operating alignment slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, are positioned within the container <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form compartments therein. Numerous projections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extend from the partitions and having chamfered edges <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to facilitate location within co-operating panel slots <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> formed in the walls of the container. This enables convenient separation of articles within the container or, alternatively, provides support for tall items arranged in the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The first and second side panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have chamfered or shaped edges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, to account for the reduced height of the front panels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> relative to the back panel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The partition <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may also be shaped accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A flap <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be cut from any one of the front or end reinforcement panel portions to enable a card or label to be inserted in the flap. This would be particularly suitable for identifying articles contained in the container or for advertising or promotional material which may be used in relation to the articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> There are various alternative embodiments of the container which are possible and that fall within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the containers may be formed from blanks of a sheet material that are manufactured from card, cardboard, polymeric sheets, corrugated boards or other similar materials. Polymeric sheets are particularly useful as they may be easily cleaned with a cloth and reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The main advantage of the invention is that containers may easily be connected securely to one another in a side-by-side configuration. In addition, if desired, the containers may be again released from one another and collapsed to form flat blanks enabling convenient storage of the containers when not required. Any number of containers may be connected together making the container suitable for applications on shelving, and especially for the storage of small items such as nuts and bolts in a workshop, or for the display of articles in shops. Due to the reinforcing panels, at the front and end of the containers, and the double wall sections between connected containers, the arrangement is particularly resilient and rigid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the containers described in relation to the present invention may have more that two side panels and may accordingly be polygonal in shape. This enables the containers to be joined in side-by-side relationship to form circles. Accordingly, the phrase &ldquo;opposed&rdquo; in the claims should be understood in this manner, and not should not be interpreted to limit the containers to only two side walls, arranged in a substantially parallel configuration. </paragraph>
