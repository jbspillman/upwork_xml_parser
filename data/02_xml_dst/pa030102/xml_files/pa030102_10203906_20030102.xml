<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device for switching exhaust gas turbochargers for internal combustion engines, in particular for diesel engines, as well as an exhaust gas turbocharger according to independent Patent claims 1 and 7. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gas turbochargers having an adjustable turbine geometry are being used to an increasing extent in modern diesel engines in particular. Due to the variable turbine geometry with which the damming effect of the turbine is continuously variable, it is possible to achieve an energetically more favorable regulation of the exhaust gas turbocharger because all of the energy from the exhaust gas may be utilized. The exhaust gas turbocharger may be adapted to the instantaneous engine operating point, so that optimization with regard to the exhaust gas emissions and fuel consumption is possible. Such exhaust gas turbochargers are switched from regulated operation to controlled operation by switching off the boost pressure regulator in certain engine operation ranges. This switching may result in the following problems in exhaust gas turbochargers having an adjustable turbine geometry. When the combustion engine is operated at low engine speeds and low injection quantities, high boost pressures are desired, which is why the turbine control apparatus of the exhaust gas turbocharger is then switched to a closed position. However, closing of the turbine control device at the time of transition from regulated operation to controlled operation of the engine may then result in the compressor of the exhaust gas turbocharger being operated for a certain period of time at an operating point which is referred to in the compressor characteristics map as &ldquo;compressor pumping.&rdquo; As a result, a strong oscillation is induced in the fresh air mass flow and the recycled exhaust gas mass flow, which is why, firstly, the exhaust gas emission values deteriorate, and secondly, loud flow noises may occur in the air intake system of the vehicle. In addition, such &ldquo;compressor pumping&rdquo; may have a brief negative effect on engine power when, for example, the injection quantity is limited due to the great pulsation in the air intake by the engine. This has a negative effect on driving comfort. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a switching device for exhaust gas turbochargers as well as an exhaust gas turbocharger having a variable turbine geometry which operates optimally and uniformly in all operating ranges, where operation of the exhaust gas turbocharger is to be improved in the transition range between regulated and controlled operation of the exhaust gas turbocharger in particular. This object is achieved with a device according to claim 1 and an exhaust gas turbocharger according to claim 7. Advantageous embodiments and refinements are the object of the respective subclaims. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to the delay device with which the switching signal for switching the boost pressure regulator is generated with a time delay, the boost pressure regulator is left on for a certain period of time in the transition from regulated operation to controlled operation. In this way, the instantaneous boost pressure of the exhaust gas turbocharger is lowered to a level at which &ldquo;compressor pumping&rdquo; does not occur. Due to the fact that the boost pressure regulator lowers the instantaneous boost pressure accordingly, this yields an advantageous reduction in flow noises in the air intake system of the vehicle. In addition, it is possible in this way to achieve greater steady-state boost pressures in controlled operation of the boost pressure regulator, and this yields a dynamic advantage in subsequent acceleration of the vehicle. This greatly improves engine power in all operating states of the engine and the exhaust gas turbocharger. In addition, the exhaust gas emission values of engines are also reduced through the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the switching signal for switching from regulated to unregulated operation is delayable variably as a function of the operating state of the engine. In this way the device may respond dynamically to different operating states of the respective engine, which is why the efficacy of the delay in switching is increased. The exhaust gas performance and driving dynamics are further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the delay device is equipped with an engine-dependent time constant. Due to this time constant, which is optimally selectable as a function of type with various engines, the device may also be adapted to different types of engines. This device may also be manufactured easily and inexpensively due to the fact that the time constant is set only once in a fixed manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a hysteresis circuit having an upper characteristic curve and a lower characteristic curve as switching thresholds is provided for generating the switching signal. On exceeding these switching thresholds, the switching signal is advantageously not generated directly but instead with a time delay, which is why the exhaust gas turbocharger may also be operated in the transition range between regulated and controlled operation in an operating range which prevents &ldquo;compressor pumping.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the device is adapted for retrofitting into existing exhaust gas turbocharger systems. This has the advantage that the device may also be installed subsequently in turbocharger systems to improve driving dynamics and exhaust gas emissions. Existing engines may also be optimized in this regard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The exhaust gas turbocharger for compressing the air mass flow according to claim 7 has a variable turbine geometry for adjusting the compression ratio and a delay device for time-delayed switching of the boost pressure regulator from regulated operation to controlled operation. According to an advantageous embodiment, the delay device is integrated into the boost pressure regulator, i.e., no additional component is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an advantageous embodiment in this regard, the delay device is part of a central engine control device. This yields an advantage because all the control systems are combined, and thus the paths between signal generation and processing are short.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the device for switching an exhaust gas turbocharger according to the present invention, illustrated schematically in an overall view. An exhaust gas turbocharger <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a variable turbine geometry is regulated by a boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The variable turbine geometry may be implemented in a known manner, e.g., through adjustable vanes of the turbocharger, or it may have another known embodiment. In certain operating states of the engine (not shown in the drawing) operation is switched from regulated operation A by a boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to unregulated operation B by a boost pressure control <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Switching is performed by a switching signal P which is generated in a hysteresis circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the basis of the engine speed and the injection quantity as input variables. Hysteresis circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has an upper characteristic curve and a lower characteristic curve such that switching signal P is generated on exceeding the upper characteristic curve or dropping below the lower characteristic curve. Switching signal P is sent to a delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by which a delayed switching signal PT is generated. Delayed switching signal PT is relayed to boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and boost pressure actuator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for switching between operating modes A and B. For the time delay of switching signal P in delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a time constant K is deposited, i.e., stored in delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Input signal P is delayed in time by this time constant in delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Time constant K may be varied for adaptation to different types of engines. As an alternative, time constant K may also be replaced by a variable time delay quantity, which is variable, for example, as a function of the operating state of the engine. It is self-evident that determination of the time delay in delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may also be implemented in any other way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the delay device according to the present invention of the embodiment from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the form of a block diagram. Switching signal P is formed by a hysteresis circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which receives injection quantity q<highlight><subscript>mot </subscript></highlight>as input signals. Hysteresis circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes an upper characteristic curve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a lower characteristic curve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, each forming the threshold value for engine speed n<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight>. On exceeding one of characteristic curves <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, signal P is generated in circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, to switch operation of the exhaust gas turbocharger from regulated operation A to unregulated operation B. To prevent &ldquo;compressor pumping&rdquo; which may occur in switching from exhaust gas turbochargers having a variable turbine geometry, signal P is delayed by a time constant K in a delay device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (not shown in the drawing) is shut down only with delayed switching signal P<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. In this way the instantaneous boost pressure in the compressor is lowered to a level at which compressor pumping, as manifested in a great fluctuation in the intake air mass flow and thus the recovered exhaust gas volume flow, does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a diagram of the sampling ratio of the boost pressure actuator and the fresh air mass flow over time in switching an exhaust gas turbocharger according to the related art. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, on the other hand, shows the same diagram except that in this case a device according to the present invention has been used. The lower area of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows that pulses t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are delivered simultaneously, which means that boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shut down with no time delay. Switching signal P is sent directly to boost pressure regulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The right-hand area shows clearly that the curve of fresh air mass flow y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>jumps to high levels shortly after undelayed shutdown of the boost pressure regulator, and the sampling ratio of boost pressure actuator y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>immediately jumps to high values when the regulator is shut down. This means that shutting down the boost pressure regulator here results in &ldquo;compressor pumping.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, however, shows a device according to the present invention which is why the corresponding curves are more uniform here. The shutdown takes place with a 2-sec time delay, which is apparent from time-delayed pulses t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> versus t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this way the boost pressure regulator is left running for 2 sec longer, which is why the course of fresh air mass flow y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>drops uniformly in the right-hand area of the diagram. The sampling ratio of boost pressure actuator y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>no longer jumps to values, but instead increases smoothly. This illustrates the efficacy of the device according to the present invention, which effectively prevents &ldquo;compressor pumping&rdquo; in exhaust gas turbochargers having an adjustable turbine geometry when switching modes of operation. </paragraph>
