<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a system carrier for freely programmable blocks (gate arrays) that are connected to one another by means of buses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the development of complex integrated circuits (IC) first of all logic designs are created, which are based on a speech-based description in a programming language, the hardware description language (HDL) as it is known. For the purpose of functional verification of highly integrated microelectronic circuits, it is usual to use logic simulation in the development phase. As a supplement to the simulation, in recent years specific platforms for the logic emulation have been used. The circuit, which is present as a network list and is to be verified, was partitioned onto freely programmable logic blocks (FPGA) which are connected by means of specific programmable switching matrices. This technique is known as rapid prototyping. The developer is therefore made capable of testing the circuit on the platform in an early development phase of a logic design before said circuit is cast in silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The drawback with this system is that, because of the switching matrix, considerable propagation time delays have to be tolerated, which makes the verification of the logic design more difficult or even impossible. Added to this is the fact that the programmable blocks are placed fixedly on the platform and are connected to one another via the switching matrix by likewise fixed connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention is based on the object of providing a universally usable system carrier which manages without a switching matrix, so that very short and always fixedly pre-determinable signal propagation times are achieved and the system can be verified in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the case of a system carrier of the generic type outlined at the beginning, according to the invention this object is achieved by at least three identically configured connectors for receiving in each case one module with a freely programmable block (gate array) being disposed on the system carrier, it being possible for said module to be coupled to the connector and its position changed, the connectors being fixedly connected to one another by means of three groups of buses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The significant advantage is therefore achieved that the system carrier, which is initially present as an unconfigured board, merely contains a fixed bus system. only after being fitted with the modules, which contain freely programmable blocks and have a coincident architecture, is the system board given its logic function as a result of programming and can be used immediately. With the aid of the individually configurable blocks, which can be placed in variable positions, it is possible quickly to produce an optimum connection which is matched to the intended purpose via the bus system, which permits different access to the electronic capabilities of the board. As a result of the modular construction of the system, the further advantage results that recourse can always be had to available FPGA blocks of different size, and the most recent technological generation of FPGA blocks can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In each module, the freely programmable block is fixedly connected to a circuit board, from the underside of which plug-in pins project, which can be plugged into corresponding receiving seats in the connectors. The configuration of the plug-in pins and of the receiving seats is symmetrical in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the configuration of the plug-in pins and the receiving seats has point symmetry, each module can be coupled to the connector in two different positions by being rotated through 180&deg;. In addition, it is also conceivable to produce different positions of the modules by means of longitudinal displacement on the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Each of the bus groups has different tasks and, if appropriate, also data transmission capacities. In a first group of buses (private buses), each bus in each case connects two connectors directly to each other. By means of the second group of buses (local buses), all the connectors are connected to one another. The third group of buses (global buses) connects all the connectors to one another and, in addition, produces a link with a further system carrier. The architecture of the system carrier therefore permits a plurality of system carriers to be connected in parallel in order to expand the capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Some of the buses can additionally be connected to a memory.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the prior art already explained with a system carrier (board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), on which a total of three programmed blocks A, B, C are fixedly placed. The blocks (modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) are connected to one another and to a switching matrix <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via likewise fixed connecting lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (buses). As already mentioned, such a system is not flexible, as a result of which production and application for emulation purposes are expensive and time-consuming. In addition, it is a considerable drawback that the switching matrix <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not cause predictable propagation time delays, so that no real-time capability is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, two system carriers (boards <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;) constructed in accordance with the invention are illustrated schematically, each of which likewise carries three modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with freely programmable FPGA blocks A, B, C but the latter are not situated fixedly on the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but can be interchanged and additionally changed in their position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is indicated schematically that each module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contains a freely programmable gate array block (FPGA) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is permanently fitted to a circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. From the underside of the circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, plug-in pins <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> project, which can be plugged into corresponding receiving seats <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which are provided on the system carrier (board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) (cf. also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the plan view of one possible embodiment of the system carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without electrical wiring with three connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it being possible for the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with its receiving seats <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be seen in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, while the two other connectors are each occupied by a module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> reveals that the configuration of the plug-in pins <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the underside of the module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the receiving seats <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> correspond to one another, it being possible to see a symmetry both with regard to the two axes and also with regard to the center. This results in the extremely advantageous possibility of fitting each module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in at least two different positions on the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the case of point symmetry, two different positions on the connector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be produced by means of rotation of the modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through 180&deg;, which will be described in more detail further below. In addition, it is also conceivable, given appropriate configuration of the connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and of the plug-in pins <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to achieve different positionings by displacing the modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the connector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For the capability to use the system carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> universally, it is also significant that the latter is equipped with a fixed bus system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> indicates that all three connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provided for the modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected to one another in pairs by means of private buses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> illustrated in a ring shape. The private buses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can have different capacities and tasks, which is symbolized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by the bus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shown as a continuous line, the bus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; reproduced dashed and the bus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&Prime; indicated dash-dotted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A second group of buses is formed by the local buses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as they are known, which connect all the connectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to one another. These local buses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown as zigzag lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Finally, the third group of buses is formed by global buses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as they are known, which are symbolized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as wavy lines and which connect all the connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to one another and in addition produce a connection to a further system carrier, to the system carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. By means of the global bus <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a plurality of system carriers can therefore be connected together in order to expand the overall system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> indicates that the private bus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&Prime; is connected to a memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and one of the local buses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to another memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a detail from the right-hand part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> with the three connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are connected to one another by the private buses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (continuous lines), <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; (dashed lines) and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&Prime; (shown dash-dotted). In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the local buses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are shown as zigzag lines and the global buses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as wavy lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> All three connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are occupied by modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whose freely programmable blocks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (FPGA) are programmed in such a way that the result is full utilization which is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> by the completely occupied pin groups of different gray tones, which correspond to the gray tones of the connected buses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> show an application example in which in each case the result is not maximum utilization of the buses, but only different partial utilizations. Here, too, again all the plug-in pins <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the FPGA blocks <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are connected to one another by the buses, but are not completely electrically occupied; the unoccupied regions are drawn in black. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, because of partial occupancy of the left-hand halves of the modules A, B, C, the private buses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&Prime; are only partially utilized, while the local buses <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the global buses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are utilized completely (right-hand parts of the connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Then if, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the modules A, B, C are rotated through 180&deg;, their only partially occupied regions, which previously lay in the left-hand part, are connected to the private buses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&Prime;, so that the latter are now fully utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> From this, by means of simple rotation or, as indicated, displacement, of the modules <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the result is that the capacity and the different intended use of the buses can be used optimally. One of the intended uses can be, for example, access to a memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the invention, there is the possibility of operating the system with only one or two modules or of using modules which are smaller than the connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that&mdash;as indicated&mdash;the different positioning can be produced by displacement instead of by rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the invention are primarily to be seen in the fact that a far-reaching real-time capability is implemented, so that many different circuit designs can be simulated and a subsequently implemented semiconductor circuit can be simulated in terms of function and time behavior. Since no switching matrix is required in order to connect critical signal paths, the very short signal propagation times can be predicted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The fixed bus structure permits optimal signal connection of the freely programmable gate arrays to one another. The result of the modular construction is that the FPGAs can be chosen freely and can be interchanged with one another and positioned so that the internal bus structure is utilized in an optimal way. </paragraph>
