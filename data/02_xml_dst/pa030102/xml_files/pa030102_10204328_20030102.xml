<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a powered rolling shutter whereof the stator of the motor is connected to a fixed support via elastic means (R<highlight><bold>1, </bold></highlight>R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) for stopping the shutter in high and low abutment when the resisting torque exceeds a selected value, consisting of two springs (R<highlight><bold>1, </bold></highlight>R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) compressed by the stator rotation. The travel distance (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) before one of the springs (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is compressed is greater than the travel distance (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) before the other spring (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is compressed. The compression is ensured by a mobile element (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) also actuating a switch (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). The travels (c<highlight><bold>1, </bold></highlight>c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) required for actuating the switch can be inverted. The motor can be mounted on the left or on the right with a differentiated resisting torque for stopping in high abutment and low abutment. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a motorized roller shutter or the like comprising an electric drive motor the stator of which is connected to a fixed support via elastic means which oppose the rotation of the stator under the effect of the resistive torque exerted by the roller shutter moving between a rolled up up position and an unrolled down position, stop means stopping the roller shutter in these up and down positions and means of controlling the stopping of the motor in these up and down positions comprising a switch the opening of which is actuated by the rotation of the stator when the resistive torque exceeds the retaining force exerted by the elastic means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Roller shutters thus equipped are described in patents FR 2 740 824, EP 0 936 342 and EP 0 703 344. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The roller shutter described in patent FR 2 740 824 uses a single spring. The switch is open when the roller shutter is in the unrolled position and the motor is powered via an auxiliary switch controlled by a revolutions counter associated with the motor. Such a roller shutter has to be mounted in a determined position in a window aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The roller shutters described in patents EP 0 936 342 and EP 0 703 344 are equipped with two antagonist springs between which the stator of the motor is held. One of these springs is compressed when the roller shutter, completely rolled up, arrives at a top stop, while the other spring is compressed when the roller shutter, completely unrolled, has reached the bottom stop, generally against the bottom of the aperture. Now, as described in patent FR 2 740 824, the top stop spring has to be able to oppose the torque generated by the weight of the roller shutter. Now, when the shutter is almost completely unrolled, this weight may be very great. By contrast, the spring which controls the stopping of the motor when the roller shutter reaches the bottom stop has to give relatively readily in order to avoid needless compression of the shutter reaching the bottom stop, which compression could damage the shutter. It is therefore necessary to have two springs, one of them very strong, for the top stop, and the other far weaker, for the bottom stop. Now, by equipping the stopping device with two different springs, the direction of rotation of the motor corresponding respectively to the rolling-up and to the unrolling of the roller shutter, is determined, and this means that the motor has always to be arranged on the same side of the aperture, given that if the motor is arranged on the opposite side of the aperture its direction of rotation will have to be reversed, for the same position of the roller shutter, of course, which is generally the case. This represents a constraint that cannot always be satisfied and it is therefore necessary to have two motors with their stopping control device, one for mounting on the left and the other for mounting on the right of the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is to produce a roller shutter the motor and the stopping device of which can be mounted with equal ease on either side of the aperture. The stopping device has also to be compact so that it can be arranged inside a motor, particularly a tubular motor, without increasing the size thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The roller shutter according to the invention is characterized in that the elastic means consist of two springs working in compression between two moving compression elements driven in turn by the stator respectively in each of the directions of rotation, the distance to be covered by the driven moving element, from, the rest position, before one of the springs is compressed, exceeding the distance to be covered by the driven moving element before the other spring is compressed, and in that the stopping device comprises an actuating member kinematically linked to the stator and, on the one hand, driving the compression elements and, on the other hand, actuating the switch after a determined travel which differs for each direction of rotation of the stator and means of reversing the lengths of the travels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the stator rotates, just one spring is compressed first of all, this compression corresponding to the shortest travel of the actuating member, that is to say to the stopping of the motor when the roller shutter reaches the bottom stop. When the moving drive element moves in the opposite direction corresponding to its long travel, just one spring is compressed first of all, then both springs are compressed, offering significantly more resistance, this situation corresponding to the roller shutter arriving at the top stop. Actuation of the means of reversing the travel lengths makes it possible to obtain the same result when the motor is rotating in the opposite direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The distance to be covered by the driven moving element before one of the springs is compressed may be zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The springs are advantageously helical, with different diameters and nested coaxially one inside the other. Such a construction is particularly compact. To simplify the construction, the compression elements advantageously have a single distance between them and the springs are of different lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The spring compressed second is advantageously precompressed at rest. Both springs may be precompressed. Precompressing the springs makes it possible to operate on a gentle slope with short travel, which allows better control over the forces developed by the springs and therefore makes it possible to enjoy great precision in the triggering forces, particularly in that of the spring which is compressed by itself which has not to be too high in order not to damage the roller shutter. Precompression also makes it possible to reduce the size of the stopping device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The actuating member may be part of the stator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the actuating member consists of a traveler guided in the support and equipped, on one side, with two arms for driving the compression elements in the compression direction and, on the other side, with two arms for actuating the switch which is mounted between these arms and the means of reversing the length of the travels consist of a rocker mounted between the actuating arms of the switch and equipped with two arms which act alternately as arm for actuating the switch depending on the position of the rocker, the other arm being retracted relative to the switch, the active arm being situated between one of the actuating arms of the traveler and the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to an improvement of this embodiment, the arms of the rocker are flexible in a direction parallel to its axis of pivoting and the stopping device comprises a fixed stop situated in the path of the arms of the rocker, facing the open position of the switch, this stop having the effect of moving the active actuating arm of the rocker away from its normal active path so as to make it inoperative. This improvement prevents the motor from being powered in the rolling-up direction if an attempt is made at raising the roller shutter by hand, for example in the event of an attempted break-in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, the switch is mounted between the arms of the traveler and can move in the same direction as the traveler, so as to be able to alter the distance separating it from each of the actuating arms of the traveler, that is to say the length of the travel needed to actuate it using the traveler in each of the directions of rotation of the stator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the springs are mounted in a cage one of the ends of which has a lateral arm driven directly by the traveler, the compression element compressing the other ends of the springs consisting of a part in the form of a piston entering the cage and the strongest spring which is precompressed between the two ends of the cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The appended drawing depicts, by way of example, some embodiments of the invention. To simplify, the cylindrical surfaces are depicted as straight, that is to say in development.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically depicts a well known way of driving a roller shutter, described for example in patent FR 2 666 842. It is possible to discern a winding tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> about which a roller shutter is rolled up. This winding tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, depicted in part, is borne, on the side depicted, by an annulus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> mounted to rotate on the cylindrical tubular casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of an electric geared motor unit. The other end of the winding tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted so as to rotate on a support which has not been depicted. The casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted on a fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for example, in the aperture of a window. Thus, mounted in the tubular casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are an electric motor associated with reduction gearing the output of which drives an annulus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> itself driving the rotation of the winding tube <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As is the case of the constructions described in patents FR 2 740 824 and EP 0 936 342, the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the motor, and therefore the motor stator fixed to this casing, is connected elastically to the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in such a way as to be able to turn slightly about its axis denoted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by the reference <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This elastic connection is depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Mounted coaxially in a housing <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are two springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, longer than the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and of smaller diameter, being mounted inside the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which itself is substantially stronger than the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are mounted between two compression pieces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> equipped, on the one hand, with a guiding arm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>respectively which are mounted to slide freely in guide slots <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The compression pieces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are also equipped with a lateral arm <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that they can be driven by the arms <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> respectively of a traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is secured to the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to rotate as one therewith by an arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and guided in the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in guides <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to move parallel to the springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two parallel arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>opposite the arms <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Mounted between these arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is the arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of a reversing switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can occupy three positions, a central position O in which the switch is open, a position M in which the motor is powered in the raising direction, that is to say in the direction for rolling up the roller shutter, and a position D in which the motor is powered in the down position, that is to say in the direction for unrolling the roller shutter. The traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> bears a rocker <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> articulated about an axis <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transversely to the traveler. This rocker <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is equipped with two arms <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which can be positioned, in turn, between the arms <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the traveler so that, in this position, the arm can actuate the switch when the traveler moves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The device is depicted in its rest position. It is assumed first of all that the roller shutter is completely rolled up. Unrolling is triggered by the switch being placed in the position D which has the effect of powering the winding S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the motor (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). When the roller shutter comes against the bottom stop it exerts on the motor a resistive torque which has a tendency to drive the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and therefore the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, connected to the casing <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in the direction of the arrow F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the traveler exerts thrust on the arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the compression piece <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. When the resistive torque is high enough to compress the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the traveler moves in the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, after a certain travel, the arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the rocker meets the arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the switch. After a travel c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> this arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is brought into the position O. The power supply to the motor is cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The rolling-up of the roller shutter is brought about by placing the switch in the position M which has the effect of powering the winding S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the motor (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). When the roller shutter reaches the top stop, it exerts on the motor a resistive torque which has the tendency to drive the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This resistive torque is soon sufficient for the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to drive the compression piece <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via its arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, compressing the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The compression piece continuing to move then compresses the two springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being brought into the position O only when the arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the traveler has covered the travel c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is substantially greater than the travel c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, the resistive torque needed to actuate the switch is therefore substantially higher than the resistive torque needed to stop the motor against the bottom stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If the motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with its support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are mounted on the other side of the aperture, so that the direction of rotation of the motor for rolling up and unrolling is reversed, then the rocker <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is rocked into the position shown in chain line and it is then the arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the position <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; which actuates the switch. The travels c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are therefore reversed and the device for stopping the motor is thus adapted to the change in direction of rotation of the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be slightly precompressed. By contrast, the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not precompressed at rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is, however, more advantageous to work with two precompressed springs, as this makes it possible to use springs with a gentle slope and to operate linearly over short travels, which makes it possible to have better control over the forces developed by R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and therefore makes it possible to enjoy great precision in the triggering forces, particularly in those of the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has not to be too high in order not to damage the shutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The different lengths and the different stiffnesses of the springs are not necessary conditions for obtaining the desired result. The springs could have the same stiffness. It would be sufficient for a travel c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the traveler for just one spring to be compressed and, for a longer travel c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for both springs to be compressed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates these conditions for compression elements <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> compressing two springs, here depicted in parallel. The distance between the compression elements for each of these springs is not necessarily the same. In general, for the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be compressed by itself first of all, it is necessary and sufficient for l<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be greater than l<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is to say for the distance l<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be covered by the driven compression element before it compresses R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be greater than the distance l<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be covered by the compression element before it compresses R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In general, there will be l<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;zero, that is to say that there is no dead travel. The spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be precompressed or not. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates schematically an alternative form of embodiment of the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in which alternative form the two springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are precompressed. The spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is precompressed between the compression pieces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is precompressed in a cage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, more specifically between two pairs of forks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of this moving cage which is guided in a guide <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. These forks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> allow the compression pieces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to pass. In the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the compression piece <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can thus pass through the fork <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to compress the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the fork <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comes into abutment and, conversely, the compression piece <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can pass through the fork <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to compress the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> schematically illustrate an improvement to the first embodiment or to its alternative, avoiding reapplication of power to the motor in the raising direction if, once the shutter has stopped in the down position, it is lifted up by hand by its last lath, for example during an attempted break-in. In this case, if <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is considered, the thrust on the roller shutter exerts on the motor a torque in the direction of the arrow F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is to say a torque the direction of which is the same as the resistive torque which caused the motor to stop. The traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will therefore rock the switch into the position M which causes the rolling-up of the roller shutter. To prevent this, the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is equipped with a rocker <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> the arms of which are flexible at least in a direction parallel to the axis of articulation of the rocker and fixed to the support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a stop <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which, on each side, has a ramp <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and is placed, between the arms of the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in the path of the active arm of the rocker <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, for example the arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The top of the stop <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also faces the position O of the switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the roller shutter is unrolled in the down position and stopped, the switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in the position O. When the roller shutter is lifted up, the arm <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the rocker meets the ramp <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which moves the arm away from its normal path as depicted by the arrow F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that it does not meet the arm <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the switch and so that the motor is not powered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Reversing the lengths of travel c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be obtained by moving the switch. This alternative is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is mounted in a moving support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which can be moved in a housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The moving support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is equipped with guide arms sliding in a guide of the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The moving support <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is used in abutment against one or other of the ends of the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> One practical embodiment of the part of the stopping device concerning the springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The springs R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are mounted in a cage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> consisting of a transverse wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> forming the end of the cage and of two arms <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending from the wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> parallel to the axis of the springs and connected, near their ends, by a bow <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The ends of the arms <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> end in two walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which are mutually parallel and parallel to the axis of the springs. The spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is precompressed between the end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cage and the edge of the walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Also extending from the end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a tubular part <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> surrounded by the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This tubular part serves to guide the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> engaged freely in this part <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so as to press against the end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. At the end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cage is bent twice at right angles to form a radial tab <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by which the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can drive the cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Also engaged in the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a part <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the form of a hollow piston, at the end of which the other end of the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rests. This part <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has a head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of a diameter that exceeds the body of the piston <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> but which is cut with two parallel flats so that the head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can pass between the walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the cage. The head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can therefore compress the spring R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The use of the cage depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a stopping device according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The arm <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the traveler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rests directly on the head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which piston, at rest, also rests against the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The radial arm <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be driven by the arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the traveler. The arm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the cage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used for guiding the cage, that is to say for preventing it from rotating about its axis. To this end, the arm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is engaged in a guide slot. At rest, the spring R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also precompressed. The piston <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> thus has to be kept pushed slightly into the cage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in order to mount this cage in the fixed support <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this case, the compression pieces <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> consist respectively of the head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the piston and of the end <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cage <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Apart from these few embodiment differences, the way in which the device works is the same as in the case of the device depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the devices depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is possible to replace the reverser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a pair of switches. By way of example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> depicts a modification to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in which up and down stoppage is provided by two bistable switches <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; controls stopping in the down direction. It is depicted in the closed position. The switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime; controls stopping in the up direction. It is depicted in the open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The device is depicted in its position of rest as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is assumed that the shutter is completely rolled up. Unrolling is triggered by action on the switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; placed in the down position D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). The device works in the same way as the device according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. To raise the shutter, the switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime; is placed in the up position M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Instead of bistable switches it is possible to use monostable switches by adapting the control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the diagram depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, use is made of two monostable switches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&Prime;, which are closed in the rest position, in conjunction with a control switch <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The switches <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&Prime; correspond to the circuit breakers in a conventional diagram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the diagram depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the bistable switches <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&Prime; are open in the rest position.
