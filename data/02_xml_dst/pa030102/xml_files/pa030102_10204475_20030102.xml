<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rewinding machine for the production of rolls of wound-up weblike material, for example rolls intended for the production of small rolls of toilet paper, kitchen towel and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In particular, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a rewinder of the peripheral or superficial type, that is to say one in which the roll or log being formed is retained in rotation in a winding-up cradle by means of winding-up members which are in contact with the roll being formed over its peripheral surface, transmitting thereto the rotational winding-up movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a winding method which can be implemented on the abovementioned rewinder. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">STATE OF THE ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the paper converting industry, use is frequently made of machines known as winders or rewinders, which receive an incoming weblike material coming from a parent reel or plurality of parent reels, to wind it up in the form of rolls or logs of diameter equal to the diameter of the finished product and great length. These rolls or logs are subsequently cut orthogonally to their axis to form small rolls of toilet paper, kitchen towel and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Machines of this type, based on the peripheral winding-up procedure, are described and illustrated, for example, in: U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,724, U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,725, U.S. Pat. No. 4,828,195, U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,897, U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,377, U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,130, U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,106, U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,252, GB-A-2 105 688, WO-A-94/21 545. Machines based on the central or mandrel winding-up procedure are described in U.S. Pat. No. Re-28,353, U.S. Pat. No. 3,532,572, U.S. Pat. No. 3,552,670, U.S. Pat. No. 3,567,552, U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,423. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The rewinding machines are normally designed on a large scale and operate at very high speeds. In particular, the present trend is toward producing rewinding machines suitable for processing weblike material of ever-increasing width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In some applications, however, it would be appropriate to have rewinding machines of modest size available, in particular to meet the needs of emerging markets where high production speeds are not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To meet these needs, a peripheral rewinding machine of particularly modest size has been developed and is described in WO-A-97/32 804. This rewinding machine provides a special winding-up system, with means of gluing the final free edge of the roll located downstream of the winding-up cradle. Normally, the unloading of the finished log and its gluing require a cyclical slowing of the production line in order to obtain correct positioning of the free edge of the weblike material to be glued in order to seal the roll. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a machine, especially but not exclusively of the peripheral or superficial type, of modest size, and therefore particularly easy to transport and such as to take up little space when in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a particular aspect, it is also an object of the invention to produce a compact machine in which the feed speed of the weblike material need not be reduced at the end of each winding-up cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Substantially, these and other objects and advantages, which will be clear to the person skilled in the art from reading the text that follows, are achieved in a rewinding machine equipped with a winding-up system, generally of the central or peripheral type, and with a system for severing the weblike material at the end of each winding-up cycle in order to generate a final edge and an initial edge, wherein an adhesive applicator applies the adhesive to the final free edge of each roll in a position upstream of the roll in the final phase of winding-up in the winding-up system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Normally, contrary to what is envisaged by the present invention, the adhesive for sealing the free edge is applied to the final edge or to the roll downstream of the winding-up system, when the roll has been unloaded from said system. For this purpose, suitable gluing machines are usually provided, disposed in line with the rewinding machine, optionally with the interposition of a storage unit. This makes the line complex and bulky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, conversely, the adhesive is applied to an end portion of the weblike material before the latter is wound up onto the roll and before the roll is unloaded from the winding-up system. This makes the machine more compact and enables other advantages to be achieved, which will become clear in due course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,377 describes a system in which the adhesive is applied to the final edge of the weblike material before completion of the roll. However, in this case, the adhesive is not applied by an applicator directly onto the weblike material. To the contrary, it is delivered onto a winding-up core and the latter, when it is inserted into the winding-up system, transfers some of the adhesive applied thereto to the final edge in order to achieve sealing thereof. This known solution has significant limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Specifically, it is applicable only with special winding-up systems and only with certain systems for severing the weblike material and introducing new winding-up cores. Furthermore, it is not applicable in cases where the winding-up takes place without a central core. It should also be borne in mind that it is not always possible or appropriate to use the same adhesive for the final free edge of a roll and to anchor the initial free edge to the winding-up core in order to initiate the winding-up of the subsequent roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> These limitations are overcome by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the adhesive is applied to the weblike material before the latter is cut, torn or otherwise severed by the severing system. This may take place, for example, by disposing the adhesive applicator upstream of the severing system. However, in principle, it would also be conceivable to dispose the adhesive applicator downstream of the area in which the severing system acts or on the severing system itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Although the winding-up system may be of any kind, including the central type (i.e. the type in which the winding-up movement is imparted to the roll by means of a central mandrel around which the material is wound up), according to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention the winding-up system comprises a peripheral winding-up cradle. In this case, the adhesive applicator may be disposed upstream of the winding-up cradle, for example facing one of the winding-up rolls which form part of said cradle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By comparison also with the more compact rewinding machines describe, in WO-A-97/32 804, the present invention provides the possibility of a further reduction in the bulk of the machine and the possibility of achieving a high level of reliability and precision in gluing, even without temporary reductions of the feed speed of the weblike material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to wind up even rolls of large diameter. This is possible because, once the adhesive has been applied, before completion of the winding-up of the final free edge of the roll, the latter performs a rotation in the winding-up cradle and subsequently on an unloading surface to exert pressure on the final free edge and stabilize the latter for gluing to the final turn of the roll. In practice, the roll may also perform a complete revolution in the winding-up cradle before being unloaded, so that at the time of unloading the final free edge has already been pressed against the last turn of the roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the traditional systems, conversely, this operation requires especially in the case of rolls of large diameter&mdash;very long rolling surfaces in order to ensure that pressure is always exerted on the final free edge, and hence large bulk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In practice, the adhesive applicator may comprise one or more nozzles disposed side by side to spray the necessary dose of adhesive onto the weblike material. However, different systems for applying the adhesive, for example a contact system with brush or pad members which touch the weblike material, transferring the necessary adhesive thereto, are not ruled out, although the use of nozzles is advantageous because it is simpler in design and from the standpoint of maintenance and preparation, as well as being more flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a practical embodiment, the winding-up cradle may possess a winding-up system comprising a first winding-up roller and, optionally, a second and a third winding-up roll, in accordance with a technology known per se, although the possibility of a different configuration of the winding-up cradle is not excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When at least a first winding-up roller is provided, the spray nozzle or nozzles which apply the adhesive in order to seal the free edge of the weblike material are disposed, relative to the first winding-up roll, in a manner such as to spray the adhesive onto the weblike material when the latter is supported and moved around said winding-up roll. The means for severing the weblike material are advantageously disposed downstream, in the direction of movement of the weblike material, relative to the position of the spray nozzles which apply the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The rewinding machine may be of the type which winds up onto tubular cores, but the possibility is not excluded of applying the same criterion to rewinding machines which produce rolls of weblike material wound-up without a central winding-up core, using known winding-up techniques described, for example, in EP-A-0 580 561 and EP-A-0 611 723. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a further aspect of the present invention, a particular configuration of an embossing and laminating unit is also proposed, of particular compactness, capable of being inserted into a rewinding machine of modest size. According to this aspect of the invention, the embossing unit has a first and a second embossing cylinder and a first and a second pressure roller, the embossing cylinders and the pressure rollers being supported by the side frames which also support the perforating unit, the winding-up cradle of the rewinding machine, particular compactness thereby being achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In practice, a reduction in bulk may advantageously be obtained by placing the embossing cylinders one above the other vertically, in a manner such that the first embossing cylinder is located above the second embossing cylinder, for example and advantageously (but not necessarily) with the axes placed one above the other in a vertical plane. In this case, the first pressure roller is positioned above the first embossing cylinder, while the second pressure roller is disposed below the second embossing cylinder, but offset laterally relative to the plane containing the axes of the embossing cylinders, which plane may advantageously and preferably (but not necessarily) be approximately vertical. In this configuration, the winding-up cradle is situated, relative to the plane in which the axes of rotation of the embossing cylinders lie, on the side opposite that on which the second pressure roller is located. In this manner, as will become clear from the detailed description of an example of embodiment, a configuration of particularly reduced size is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A system for combining the plies that constitute the weblike material may be associated with the embossing unit. For example, a ply-bonding unit may be provided. in an alternative embodiment, an adhesive dispenser may be provided which, in a manner known per se, applies an adhesive to one of the two plies of the weblike material, after the ply has been embossed. In this case, the adhesive dispenser is advantageously disposed above the second pressure roller, again in order to obtain a very compact configuration. The possibility of disposing both an adhesive dispenser and a ply-bonding unit in the same machine, so as to permit the user to employ both methods, is not excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a winding-up method for the production of rolls of weblike material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further advantageous features of the machine and method according to the invention are indicated in the attached claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A detailed description will be given below of a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, complete with accessories and elements which may also, in part, be omitted. The embodiment illustrated is of the type having tubular winding-up cores on which the individual rolls are formed, but, as stated previously, the machine may also be designed for winding-up without a tubular core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The rewinder, generally designated <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, comprises side frames <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on which is mounted a winding-up cradle, generally designated <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and comprising in the example shown a trio of winding-up rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> forms, together with the second winding-up roller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a gap <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through which the weblike material and the roll pass at the start of the phase of formation around the respective winding-up core A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> receives the weblike material N from an unwinder (not shown). The third winding-up roller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is mounted on an arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> oscillating about an axis <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in order to adapt to the increase in size of the roll being formed. Downstream of the winding-up cradle is disposed an unloading chute <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with a roll-stopping device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> controlled by an actuator <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which intervenes to stop the movement of the rolls and unload, in a controlled manner, the individual rolls delivered to the winding-up cradle along the chute <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Below the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> extends a curved rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> along which the winding-up cores A roll in the first phase of winding-up of the weblike material N, in accordance with a technology known and described in detail in WO-A-94/21 545, to which reference is made for more descriptive details. Reference <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> designates an element for severing the weblike material, which rotates in a controlled manner about an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and interacts with the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to perform the severing of the weblike material at the end of the winding-up of each roll, so as to generate a final free edge, which is eventually wound onto the roll just completed, and an initial free edge which is caused to adhere to the next winding-up core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The winding-up cores A are fed to the winding-up cradle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by means of a feeder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which comprises a re-emergence guide for the cores A, designated <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The tubular cores A are inserted into the re-emergence guide <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> from below, sliding or rolling along a base surface <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of a hopper <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in which is also located an agitator <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that prevents the cores from becoming jammed. The cores are unloaded individually onto the unloading surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and retained in the waiting position by an elastic blade <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A rotating inserter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, synchronized with the rotation of the severing means <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, acts to push each tubular core A into the channel defined by the rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, at the start of each winding-up operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Above the surface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, in alignment with the holding position of the cores A before insertion into the channel between the rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, are disposed a plurality of first nozzles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which apply to the temporarily wafting tubular core A the adhesive necessary for the adhesion of the initial free edge of the weblike material. As an alternative to the gluing system, other systems may be used, for example suction or electrostatic systems or others known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Along the path of the weblike material N coming from the unwinder (not shown) is disposed an embossing and laminating unit generally designated <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and comprising a first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> rotating about an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and a second embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> rotating about an axis of rotation <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>A. The two embossing cylinders, made for example from steel or another hard material, have surface tips or protuberances which perform the embossing of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Interacting with the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, which is in a position approximately vertically above the second embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, is a first pressure roller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> supported by an arm <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> hinged at <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and pressed against the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by means of an actuator <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Interacting with the second embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is a second pressure roller <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> supported by an arm <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> hinged at <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and pressed against the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by means of an actuator <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the three axes of rotation, of the embossing cylinders and of the pressure roller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, are approximately vertically one above the other, in other words they lie in a common vertical plane shown by the line P-P. Conversely, the axis of rotation of the pressure roller <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is offset and is located, relative to the plane in which the axes of rotation <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>A of the embossing cylinders <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> lie, on the opposite side from the winding-up cradle. A particularly compact configuration is thus obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The first and second embossing cylinders <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the respective pressure rollers <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are supported by the same side frames <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that support the members forming the winding-up cradle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Interacting with the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is an adhesive dispenser <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, comprising in this example a distributor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, a first screened cylinder <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and a second plate cylinder <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, in contact with the ply of material passed around the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> in order to apply, in a manner known per se, an adhesive to the embossed protuberances of the ply generated on the surface of the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The adhesive dispenser is located above the pressure roller <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Also interacting with the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is a coupling or laminating roller <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> supported by an arm <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> hinged at <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and stressed against the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by means of a piston-and-cylinder actuator <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. By means of this, the two plies, separately embossed on the two embossing cylinders <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, are coupled by lamination after the application of the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Two plies of weblike material, designated V1 and V2, are fed to the embossing and laminating unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and are embossed separately, the first between the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the pressure roller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the second between the embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the pressure roller <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The ply V2 is then detached from the second embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and placed gently on the first ply V1 passed around the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The two plies, thus placed one above the other, are laminated between the first embossing cylinder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the laminating roller <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to form the weblike material N. An application of adhesive being provided by the dispenser <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the lamination results in the two plies V1 and V2 being bonded one to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the example of embodiment shown, there is provided along the path of the weblike material N coming from the laminating/embossing unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> a ply-bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> comprising a cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with which interact ply-bonding rollers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> stressed under pressure against the cylinder <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by means of one or more expansion boxes <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> which are expanded to high pressure. The ply bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be used in addition to the embossing unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, for example when the latter is operating without adhesive, because it lacks the dispenser <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> or because the latter has been taken out of service. This does not exclude the possibility that the machine lacks the embossing unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and is equipped only with the ply-bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which provides the coupling of the two plies V1, V2, appropriately transported to the ply-bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, for example by being passed around the roller <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to arrange that the ply-bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is entirely absent and that the machine is supplied solely with the embossing and laminating unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, with the associated adhesive dispenser <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. In this case. the path of the weblike material N will be slightly modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Along the path of the weblike material N, between the ply-bonding unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the winding-up cradle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a perforating unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is provided, comprising a rotating blade-supporting roller <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and a fixed roller <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> bearing a counter-blade. The perforating unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may be of the traditional type and is not described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The weblike material N which passes through the perforating unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is provided with a series of perforation lines orthogonal to the longitudinal course of the weblike material N, which perforation lines subdivide the weblike material N into a series of slips or sheets for subsequent use by the end consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The perforated weblike material N coming from the perforating unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is passed around a cylinder <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and, from there, around the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in order to be passed to the winding-up cradle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Interacting with the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a series of spray nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> which serve to apply an adhesive to the weblike material N in order to perform the sealing of the final free edge of the weblike material at the end of the winding-up of each individual roll, following the severing of the weblike material by the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (which are provided in appropriate numbers and suitably spaced to ensure correct gluing also of areas over the length of the roll, in other words over the width of the weblike material) are disposed in a manner such as to spray the adhesive onto the weblike material at the desired moment, before said weblike material passes into the channel defined by the winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and thus before the member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for severing the weblike material acts upon it. In this way, the adhesive, subsequently intended to seal the roll, is applied to the weblike material before the latter is severed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Expediently, the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may be mutually spaced relative to one another in a manner such that the adhesive distributed thereby does not affect those areas of the weblike material N with which the severing member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> is in contact, in a manner such that the latter does not become contaminated with adhesive during each winding-up cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> More expediently, moreover, contamination of the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by the adhesive sprayed by the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can be prevented with appropriate timing of the actions of the two members. Specifically, as is known from the prior art, the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be phased, relative to the perforation lines produced by the perforating unit <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the weblike material N, in a manner such that the weblike material is severed by tearing at a position between the roll being wound up between the rollers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the point of contact between the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and said weblike material, in other words the point at which the weblike material is pinched between the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the first winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Since the adhesive applied by the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is to remain on the end part or tail of the weblike material which is being wound up on the roll being completed, the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the perforator <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be mutually phased in a manner such that the severing action performed by the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on the weblike material takes place when the perforation along which the weblike material parts as a result of the pinching action of the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is located at a sufficient distance from the area of action of said member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, so that the adhesive previously sprayed by the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> onto the weblike material is reliably outside the area of contact between the weblike material and the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing has provided a description of the possibility of using a series of spray nozzles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to apply an adhesive to the tubular cores A before the latter are inserted between the rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, this does not exclude the possibility that the adhesive necessary for anchoring the initial free edge of the weblike material to the winding-up core A is applied by said nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. To this end, provision may be made for the latter to be actuated twice, once in order to apply the adhesive to the area of weblike material N which, after the severing performed by the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, will form the tail or final end of the roll, and a second time to the weblike material which will enter into contact with the tubular winding-up core A. In this case also, provision being made for interrupting the delivery of the adhesive by the spraying nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, it will be possible to prevent contamination of the severing member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> by the adhesive. In practice, the severing member will act between two linear areas of adhesive, the more forward one in order to seal the finished roll and the more rearward one in order to initiate the subsequent winding-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The use of two series of nozzles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is expedient when the adhesives used for sealing the final edge of the roll and anchoring the initial edge to the core are of different nature and features. This depends on the type of product wound up and/or the winding-up speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show three consecutive phases in the operation of winding-up a roll of weblike material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the roll R is in an intermediate phase of formation. A new core A, in this example, has already been positioned for subsequent insertion. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the phase of completion of the winding-up of the roll, with the separating member which rotates in the direction of the arrow f27 and enters the channel defined between the rolling surface and the upper winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> spray the adhesive necessary for the sealing of the final edge. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows the phase of delivery of the adhesive to the new core A by the nozzles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> on the weblike material N before its severing. This delivery may be simultaneous or staggered in time, and in particular advanced, by comparison with the delivery by the nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the subsequent phase, in which a new core A has already been inserted into the channel defined between the rolling surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in contact with said rolling surface and with the weblike material N passed around the winding-up roller <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Downstream of the severing member, the weblike material N has been torn to form a final edge LF which eventually becomes wound up onto the roll R, and to which the adhesive C has been applied by the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. LI designates the initial edge which is wound up onto the new core. The unloading of the roll R from the winding-up cradle takes place in a manner known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the example shown, the machine also has a printing unit, generally designated <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and comprising an inker <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, a screened cylinder <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and a plate cylinder <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> which bears the plate on which is engraved the design, decoration, text or other information to be printed on the weblike material. In this example, only the ply V1 of the weblike material N is caused to pass onto the return cylinder <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> with which the plate cylinder <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> interacts, while the other ply V2 is passed, without printing, to the embossing unit or, possibly, directly to the ply-bonding unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the drawing shows only a simplification of the invention, provided by way of a practical demonstration, and that it may be varied in shapes and arrangements without thereby departing from the scope of the concept underlying said invention. </paragraph>
