<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD TO WHICH THE INVENTION BELONGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an inflating-type safety system for a motor vehicle, more specifically to a hybrid inflator capable of inflating an air bag reliably and rapidly, and to an air bag system using the hybrid inflator. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With the development of an inflator for an inflating-type safety system of motor vehicles, a hybrid inflator using both a pressurized gas and a solid gas generating agent has been attracting attention. A main design requirement for a hybrid inflator is that the inflator inflates an air bag to a predetermined amount in a predetermined time so that the air bag is effectively activated. Various proposals concerning a structure to meet the requirement have heretofore been made (for example, as referred in JP-A 8-282427). Since such a hybrid inflator is manufactured to be installed in a motor vehicle, the weight and dimensions of the inflator, which have influence upon the weight of the motor vehicle, constitute an important design requirement therefor. And it is required to reduce the weight and number of parts while maintaining function as the hybrid inflator. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a hybrid inflator in which a weight of the inflator can be reduced and manufacturing process can be simplified, and to provide an air bag system using such a hybrid inflator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A hybrid inflator of the present invention can be applied to any of a single type hybrid inflator having a single gas generating chamber and a multistage inflating hybrid inflator having two (dual type) or more than three gas generating chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, as one means for solving the above problem, a hybrid inflator for an inflating-type safety system of a vehicle provided with an air bag, which comprises an inflator housing, a gas generator provided in the inflator housing, and an ignition means chamber having an ignition means joined to the gas generator, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> the interior of the inflator housing is filled with a pressurized medium containing an inert gas, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> the gas generator has an outer shell formed by a gas generator housing having a plurality of the communication holes, the gas generator includes, in the gas generator housing, a gas generating chamber which accommodates a gas generating agent, the gas generating chamber and the inflator housing are in communication with each other through the communication holes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> each of the communication holes provided in the gas generator housing has such a size that combustion gas generated in the gas generating chamber can flow out therethrough but the gas generating agent can be prevented from leaking outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This hybrid inflator is of a single type having one gas generating chamber. It is possible to prevent the gas generating agent from leaking outside without using a leak-blocking screen by adjusting a size (hole diameter) of a plurality of the communication holes. Since the screen for covering the communication holes by which the inflator housing communicates with the gas generating chamber provided in the gas generator housing is not used, a weight of the hybrid inflator can be reduced by a weight of the screen. Further, since a mounting step of the screen is unnecessary, the number of manufacturing steps can be reduced, and the manufacturing step can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, as another mean for solving the above problem, the present invention provides a hybrid inflator for an inflating-type safety system of a vehicle provided with an air bag, which comprises an inflator housing, a gas generator provided in the inflator housing, and an ignition means chamber having an ignition means connected to the gas generator, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> the interior of the inflator housing is filled with a pressurized medium containing an inert gas, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> the gas generator has an outer shell formed by a gas generator housing with a plurality of the first and second communication holes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> the gas generator housing includes, therein, first and second gas generating chambers each having a gas generating agent, the first gas generating chamber and the inflator housing are in communication with each other through the first communication holes, the second gas generating chamber and the inflator housing are in communication with each other through the second communication holes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> each of the first and/or second communication holes has such a size that combustion gas generated in the first and/or second gas generating chamber can flow out therethrough but the gas generating agent can be prevented from leaking outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the following three modes may be employed: (a) a plurality of the first communication holes are not covered with the screen, but a plurality of the second communication holes are covered with the screen, (b) the first communication holes are covered with the screen, but the second communication holes are not covered with the screen, and (c) both the first and second communication holes are not covered with the screen. Among these embodiments, (c) is most preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This hybrid inflator is of a dual-type having two gas generating chambers. Like the above-described single type hybrid inflator, it is possible to prevent the gas generating agent from leaking outside by adjusting a size (hole diameter) of the first and second communication holes without using a screen. Since the screen for covering a plurality of the communication holes by which the inflator housing communicates with the gas generating chambers provided in the gas generator housing is not used, a weight of the hybrid inflator can be reduced by a weight of the screen. Further, since a mounting step of the screen can be omitted, the number of manufacturing steps can be reduced, and thereby, the manufacturing step can be simplified. In a conventional dual-type hybrid inflator, a screen is mounted to each of the first and second communication holes. Since the screens are not used, the number of parts can be reduced by two, and since the mounting step of the two screens can be omitted, effects of reducing a weight and simplifying manufacturing steps are extremely great. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, a plurality of the communication holes or a plurality of the first and second communication holes provided in the gas generator housing can have the same hole diameters. By setting the hole diameters of the communication holes to the same, it becomes easy to control the amount of outflow and the outflow state of combustion gas generated by burning the gas generating agent, and additionally, manufacture of the gas generator housing can be facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, a plurality of the communication holes or a plurality of the first and second communication holes provided in the gas generator housing may have hole diameters in a range of 0.5 to 3 mm, more preferably in a range of 1.0 to 2.0 mm. By setting the hole diameter of each of a plurality of the communication holes or a plurality of the first and second communication holes in the predetermined range, the amount of outflow and the outflow-state of a combustion gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent can be controlled in the communication holes, on the whole, even when some of the holes are clogged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> And, in the hybrid inflator of the present invention, the total number of the communication holes or the first and second communication holes provided in the gas generator housing may be 100 to 600, more preferably 200 to 500. By setting the total number of the communication holes or the first and second communication holes in a predetermined range, the amount of outflow and the outflow-state of a combustion gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent can be controlled in the communication holes, on the whole, even when some of the holes are clogged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> And, in the dual-type hybrid inflator of the present invention, the total number of the first communication holes may be 50 to 300, more preferably 100 to 250, and the total number of the second communication holes may be 50 to 300, more preferably 100 to 250. By setting the total number of the first and second communication holes in a predetermined range, the amount of outflow and the outflow-state of a combustion gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent can be controlled in the communication holes, on the whole, even when some of the holes are clogged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> And, in the hybrid inflator of the present invention, the total open area of the communication holes or the first and second communication holes provided in the gas generator housing may be 100 to 600 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, more preferable 200 to 500 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. By setting the total open area of the communication holes or the first and second communication holes in the predetermined range, the amount of outflow and the outflow-state of a combustion gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent can be controlled in the communication holes, on the whole, even when some of the holes are clogged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> And, in the hybrid inflator of the present invention, a plurality of the communication holes or a plurality of the first and second communication holes provided in the gas generator housing may be arranged in a plurality of lines in the longitudinal direction of the gas generator housing as well as in a plurality of lines in the outer peripheral direction. By arranging the communication holes in plurality of the lines, requirements concerning the hole diameter, the total number and the opening area of the communication holes can be controlled easily, and thereby, the hybrid inflator which fulfills the requirements can be produced efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, as another mean for solving the above problem, the present invention provides a hybrid inflator for an inflating-type safety system of a vehicle provided with an air bag, which comprises an inflator housing, a gas generator provided in the inflator housing, and an ignition means chamber having an ignition means connected to the gas generator, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> the interior of the inflator housing is filled with a pressurized medium containing an inert gas, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> the gas generator has an outer shell formed by a gas generator housing having a plurality of the first and second communication holes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> the gas generator housing includes, therein, first and second gas generating chambers each having a gas generating agent, a first ignition means chamber having first ignition means is connected to a first gas generating chamber, a second ignition means chamber having a second ignition means is connected to a second gas generating chamber, the first gas generating chamber and the inflator housing are in communication with each other through a plurality of the first communication holes, the second gas generating chamber and the inflator housing are in communication with each other through a plurality of the second communication holes, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> each of the first and/or second communication holes has such a size that combustion gas generated in the first and second gas generating chambers can flow out therethrough but the gas generating agent can be prevented from leaking outside, the second communication holes are disposed at a distance from the second ignition means in the widthwise direction and/or the longitudinal direction of the inflator housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this invention, the expression &ldquo;the second communication holes are disposed at a distance from the second ignition means in the widthwise direction and/or the longitudinal direction of the inflator housing&rdquo; includes three states from the second ignition means, i.e. a state in which the second communication holes are disposed at a distance in the widthwise direction, a state in which the second communication holes are disposed at a distance in the longitudinal direction, and a state in which the second communication holes are disposed at a distance in both widthwise and longitudinal directions. The widthwise direction of the inflator housing means a direction toward the side-walls of the inflator housing with respect to the center axis of the inflator housing in its longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the second communication holes are disposed at a distance in the widthwise direction of the inflator housing, it is preferable that all of the second communication holes are disposed in different directions from the second ignition means in the widthwise direction of the inflator housing. When the communication holes are disposed in different directions in the widthwise direction of the inflator housing, it is preferable that all of the second communication holes are directed to a direction different from the second ignition means through 90&deg; or greater in the widthwise direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, like the above-described single type hybrid inflator, it is possible to prevent the gas generating agent from leaking outside by adjusting a size (hole diameter) of each of the first and/or second communication holes without using a leak-blocking screen. And, since such a screen can be omitted, the weight of the inflator can be reduced, the manufacturing step can be simplified, and leaking of the gas generating agent can be prevented. With respect to relation between the first and second communication holes and the screen, the above-described three modes, (a)-(c), can be employed, and the mode (c) is most preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> And, in the hybrid inflator of the present invention, when the second communication holes and the second ignition means are disposed close to each other (i.e., when they are disposed such that the widthwise direction of the inflator housing is the same direction as an example thereof shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, all the gas generating agent can be burned smoothly and uniformly by employing the above-described arrangement. Without the above arrangement, in general, the gas generating agent near the second communication holes is burned smoothly, but there is an adverse possibility such that gas generating agent away from the second communication holes is not burned smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> And the present invention includes the hybrid inflators of the above-described inventions which are further provided with one or two or three requirements selected among the requirements (1) to (3) described below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (1) A molar ratio between an amount (A mol) of the pressurized medium and an amount (B mol) of a gas generated due to combustion of the gas generating agent is 8/2 to 1/9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (2) A weight ratio (X/Y) of the weight (X) of the pressurized medium to the weight (Y) of the gas generating agent is 0.1 to 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (3) A pressure index determined by the following formula: rb&equals;&agr;P<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>(wherein, rb: burning rate, &agr;: coefficient, P: pressure, n: pressure index), at combustion of the gas generating agent, is smaller than 0.8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The pressure index (n) is obtained by two formulas, rb<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&agr;P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>and rb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;&agr;P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight>, after the burning rates rb<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is measured in a tank at the pressure P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(70 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) and the burning rates rb<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is measured in a tank at the pressure P<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(100 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> By meeting the requirements (1) and (2), a charged amount of the pressurized medium can be decreased. Consequently, even when the volume of the housing is decreased (in other words, the length and/or the width (the diameter) of the housing is decreased), a charging pressure of the pressurized medium (&equals;the internal pressure of the housing) is not increased, but can be maintained the same as that before the volume is decreased. Preferably, A/B is 8/2 to 3/7, and X/Y is 0.5 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> By meeting the requirement (3), a burning rate at the initial combustion of the gas generating agent is controlled not to increase abruptly, and thereby the internal pressure of the housing increases only slightly. Therefore, even when the thickness of the housing is reduced, a satisfactory heat-resistance can be retained. In addition, the gas generating agent is burnt stably because the internal pressure of the housing increases only slightly (in other words, the internal pressure changes a little), so that the gas generating agent can be burnt completely. Preferably, the pressure index (n) is 0.1 to 0.8, and more preferably, 0.1 to 0.7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The gas generating agent used in the hybrid inflator of the present invention is not specially limited, and one example thereof is shown below. In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, as shown in 1) and 2) below, a gas generating agent accommodated in one gas generating chamber for a single type hybrid inflator, or a first gas generating agent accommodated in the first gas generating chamber and a second gas generating agent accommodated in the second gas generating chamber for a dual type hybrid inflator can be determined based on a relation with composition of pressurized medium charged in the inflator housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 1) The Pressurized Medium Including Oxygen: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the pressurized medium consists of oxygen and an inert gas such as argon, helium (nitrogen is also included in the inert gas in the present invention), etc., the oxygen works so as to convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen generated due to the combustion of a gas generating agent as a gas generating means into carbon dioxide and vapor, while argon works so as to promote the thermal expansion of the pressurized medium. It is preferable to contain helium in the pressurized medium since the leakage of the pressurized medium can be detected easily, for the purpose of preventing distribution of the imperfect products. Concrete compositions of the pressurized medium including oxygen are determined in accordance with gas generating agent to be used and a kind thereof, and the content of oxygen is preferably about 8 to 30 mol %. A charging pressure of the pressurized medium (&equals;pressure in the inflator housing) is preferably 10,000 to 70,000 kPa and more preferably, 30,000 to 60,000 kPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the gas generating agent in the single type hybrid inflator and the dual type hybrid inflator, a gun propellant can be used for example. As the gun propellant, a single-base gun propellant, a double-base gun propellant and a triple-base gun propellant can be used. In addition to them, it is possible to use a gun propellant obtained by mixing a secondary explosive, a bonding agent, a plasticizer and a stabilizer and the like, and molding the resultant mixture to a desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The secondary explosive can include hexahydrotrinitrotriazine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), pentaerithritol tetranitrate (PETN) and triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN). For example, when a gas generating agent using RDX as a secondary explosive is burned in an oxygen-absent atmosphere under a pressure of 20,670 kPa and at a combustion temperature of 3348 K, a formed gas in a combustion gas comprises 33 mol % of nitrogen, 25 mol % of carbon monoxide, 23 mol % of vapor, 8 mol % of carbon dioxide and other gas components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The bonding agent can include cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butylate, cellulose acetate propiolate, ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl acetate, azide polymer, polybutadiene, polybutadiene hydride and polyurethane; the platicizer can include trimethylolethane trinitrate, butantriol trinitrate, nitroglycerine, bis(2,2-dintropropyl) acetal/formal, glycidyl azide and acetyltriethl citrate and the like; and the stabilizer can include ethlcentralite, diphenylamine and loesosinol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A preferable ratio of the secondary explosive to the bonding agent, plasticizer and stabilizer is about 50 to 90 wt. % of secondary explosive to about 10 to 50 wt. % of bonding agent, plasticizer and stabilizer in all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is difficult in some cases to burn the gas generating agent of the above-described composition under normal pressure. However, in the hybrid inflator according to the present invention, since the interior thereof is maintained at a high pressure in advance, the gas generating agents can be burned stably and smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> 2) The Pressurized Medium not Including Oxygen: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the pressurized medium consists of substantially an inert gas such as argon, helium (nitrogen is also included in the inert gas in the present invention), etc., and when the composition does not contain oxygen, argon works so as to promote the thermal expansion of the pressurized medium. It is preferable to contain helium in the pressurized medium since the leakage of the pressurized medium can be detected easily for the purpose of preventing distribution of the imperfect products. And it is preferable that the pressurized medium does not contain oxygen. However, the pressurized medium can contain oxygen in order to improve a combustion of the gas generating agents. In that case, the amount of added oxygen is preferably not more than 10 mol %, and more preferably 5 mol %. A charging pressure of the pressurized medium is preferably 10,000 to 70,000 kPa and more preferably, 30,000 to 60,000 kPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As the gas generating agent accommodated in the single type hybrid inflator and the dual type hybrid inflator, it is possible to use a material including fuel and oxidizer, or fuel, oxidizer and slag-forming agent which are mixed together with bonding agent if necessary and formed into a desired shape. If such a gas generating agent is used, a gas generated by its combustion can be supplied together with the pressurized medium for developing the airbag. Especially when the gas generating agent including the slag-forming agent is used, the amount of mist discharged from the inflator can be reduced much. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the fuel can be one or two or more materials selected from a group consisting guanidine derivative such as nitroguanidine (NQ), guanidine nitrite (GN), guanidine carbonate, amino nitroguanicine, amino guanidine nitrite, amino guanidine carbonate, diamino guanidine nitrite, diamino guanidine carbonate, and triamino guanidine nitrite. Further as the fuel, one or two or more materials selected from a group comprising tetrazole and tetrazole derivative can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As oxidizer, one or two or more materials selected from a group comprising strontium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, potassium perchlorate, copper oxide, ferrous oxide, basic copper nitrate can be used. Preferable composition amount of oxidizer is 10 to 80 parts by weight, and more preferably, 20 to 50 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the slag-forming agent can be one or two or more materials selected from a group consisting of acid clay, talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, silica, alumina, sodium silicate, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, hydrotalsite, and a mixture thereof. Preferable composition amount of slag-forming agent is 0 to 50 parts by weight, and more preferably, 1 to 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the bonding agent can be one or two or more materials selected from a group consisting of sodium salt of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, starch, polyvinyl alcohol, guar gum, microcrystal cellulose, polyacrylamide and calcium stearate. Preferable composition amount of the bonding agent is 0 to 30 parts by weight, and more preferably, 3 to 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent having the above-described compositions are used, it is preferable that a molar ratio (A/B) between an amount (A mol) of the pressurized medium and an amount (B mol) of a gas generated due to combustion of the gas generating agent is adjusted to 8/2 to 1/9, and more preferably 8/2 to 3/7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described above, the charging amount of the pressurized medium can be reduced by adjusting the molar ratio between the amount of pressurized medium charged in the hybrid inflator and the amount of a gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent. Therefore, even when the volume of the inflator housing is reduced (i.e., even when the length and/or width (diameter) of the housing is reduced), it is possible to maintain the pressure at the same level as that before the volume is reduced, without enhancing the charging pressure (internal pressure of the housing) of the pressurized medium. In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, the weight ratio (x/Y) of the weight (X) of the pressurized medium to the weight (Y) of the gas generating agent is preferably 0.1 to 7, and more preferably 0.5 to 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the above hybrid inflator, it is preferable that a pressure index determined by the following formula: rb&equals;&agr;P<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>(wherein, rb: burning rate, &agr;: coefficient, P: pressure, n: pressure index), at the combustion of the gas generating agent, is smaller than 0.8. The pressure index (n) is preferably 0.1 to 0.8, and more preferably, 0.1 to 0.7. In this case, the pressure index (n) is obtained by being measured in accordance with the method described in the above requirement (3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the pressure index (n) is set to smaller than 0.8 in this manner, the burning rate at the initial stage of the combustion of the gas generating agent is restrained from increasing abruptly, whereby, increase of the pressure inside the housing is small. Accordingly, a sufficient pressure resistance of the housing can be maintained even if the thickness of the housing is reduced. Further, since the increase in internal pressure of the housing is small (i.e. a variation in the internal pressure is small), the gas generating agent is burned stably so that all the gas generating agent is burnt out completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, as a relation between the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent, the above-described combinations 1) and 2) may be employed, and the combination 2) is more preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides an air bag system comprising activation-signal outputting means including an impact sensor and a control unit, and a module case which accommodates the above-described hybrid inflator and air bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the term &ldquo;gas generator&rdquo; is the one having a gas generating performance to generate a high temperature combustion gas due to combustion of the gas generating means (gas generating agent) in the gas generator housing (gas generating chamber), thereby allowing the high temperature combustion gas to flow into the inflator housing. The hybrid inflator includes the gas generator in its inflator housing, and the term &ldquo;inflator&rdquo; is the one having a performance to flow outside, the pressurized medium existing inside of the inflator housing as well as outside of the gas generator to inflate an object to be inflated such as an air bag by flowing a high temperature combustion gas from the gas generator into the housing. The term &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; means a combination of the high temperature combustion gas generated by combustion of the gas generating agent and the pressurized medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, since the screen, for covering the communication holes by which the inflator housing communicates with the gas generating chamber provided in the gas generator housing, is not used, the number of parts and manufacturing steps can be reduced, and thereby the cost can be effectively reduced because of weight-reduction of the hybrid inflator and the facilitated manufacturing process.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be explained in detail as follows with reference to the drawings showing embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing one embodiment of a dual type hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having two gas generating chambers, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic plane view of a gas generator housing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view of a second gas generating chamber taken along the widthwise direction thereof shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are used for explaining layout of communication holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical pressure resisting container, and its inner space <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is filled with a pressurized medium and maintained at a high pressure. The pressurized medium is usually charged from a small hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> formed in a boss <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> connected to one end of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the small hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is closed with a seal pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> after the pressurized medium was charged. The inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be formed to have an uniform outer diameter except its end portion on the side of a diffuser <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (flat outer shape without constriction or the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> An outer shell of a gas generator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed by a gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The gas generator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes, therein, a flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> formed to surround the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and disposed adjacent to each other in series in the longitudinal direction of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The gas generator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is disposed in the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and its one end in its longitudinal direction is fixed to the boss <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> by welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and is connected to a first igniter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> through a booster cup <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which a booster agent (transfer charge) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is charged and a first communication passage <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> closed by a first rupturable disc <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> as a first closing means. The flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in communication with the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through flame transferring holes <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is disposed to surround the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and is defined by the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a first partition wall (first retainer) <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a second partition wall (second retainer) <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. A desired amount of a first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are in communication with each other through a plurality of first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are disposed in six lines (six holes) in the longitudinal direction of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and disposed on the entire surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the outer peripheral direction. A plurality of the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are disposed in order as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but they can be disposed staggered in the same way as the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A hole diameter of the first communication hole is 1.2 mm, and the total number of the first communication holes is <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and the total opening area is 217 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. A plurality of the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may not be disposed on the entire surface in the outer peripheral direction and may be disposed on a portion of the surface. Or alternatively, the holes may be divided into a plurality of groups and the groups of the holes may be disposed separately at an appropriate distance from one another. Being disposed on a plurality of surfaces means that, for example, a hundred and ninety-two first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in total are divided into two groups of 96 holes, and these two groups are disposed separately from each other. The first communication holes can be divided into three or more than four groups and these groups can be disposed separately from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, since a screen for preventing the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> from leaking out is not provided and thus, the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the second partition wall (second retainer) <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the boss <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (and second rupturable disc <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>). A desired amount of a second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is accommodated therein. The second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are in communication with each other through a plurality of the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A plurality of the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are disposed, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the longitudinal direction of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in four lines (four holes), and disposed on a half of the surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in its outer peripheral direction (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A plurality of the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are disposed staggered as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but they can be disposed in order in the same way as the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A diameter of the second communication hole is 1.2 mm, and the total number of the second communication holes is <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and the total opening area is 145 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. A plurality of the communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may be disposed only on a portion of the surface. Or alternatively, as described above, the holes may be divided into a plurality of groups and the groups of the holes may be disposed separately from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, since a screen for preventing the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> from leaking out is not provided and thus, the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to a second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through a second communication passage closed by a second rupturable disc <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> as the second closing means. A reference number <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>represents a booster agent, and a reference number <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>represents a booster cup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Since the first igniter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> (first ignition means <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>) and the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are disposed on the center axis (shown with the chain line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and with a center point O in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in the longitudinal direction of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is disposed eccentrically to the center axis. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed such that the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are located on the opposite side of the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the widthwise direction (radial direction). When the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are disposed close to each other, for example, (when the second igniter is located at the position <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown with the broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disposed to be in the same direction in the widthwise direction of the inflator. Therefore, gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be burnt well, but gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> existing on the opposite side cannot be burnt enough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show the dual type inflator having two gas generating chambers. An example in which the present invention is applied to a single type inflator having one gas generating chamber is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the case of the single type hybrid inflator having a gas generator housing <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> plurality of communication holes <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, by which the single gas generating chamber communicates with the inflator housing, are disposed in ten lines (ten holes) in the longitudinal direction of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and, at the same time, disposed on the entire surface thereof in the outer circumferential direction. A hole diameter of the communication hole <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is 1.2 mm, and the total number of the communication holes is <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the total opening area is 362 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In this case, the communication holes <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> may not be disposed on the entire surface in the outer peripheral direction and may be disposed on a portion of the surface. Or alternatively, as described above, the holes may be divided into a plurality of groups and the groups of the holes may be disposed separately from one another. In the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, irrespective of whether or not the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is disposed eccentrically, the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can be formed such that some or all of the holes are directed differently in the widthwise direction of the inflator housing in order to prevent mist from discharging out of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Next, one embodiment of the layout of the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> will be explained based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the side of the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is cut out. In this case, &ldquo;mist&rdquo; in the following corresponds to a solid component (for example, a metal component) in the gas generating agents which is generated due to combustion of the gas generating agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> plurality of the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are formed only on one surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are formed only on the opposite surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. By disposing the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> on the widthwise-opposite sides, facing each other, of the surface of the gas generator housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, when a mist (first mist) generated by burning the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> flows out from the first communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and adheres to an opposite inner wall surface of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a gas flow (second gas flow) generated by combustion of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> flows into the opposite side of the inner wall surface of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on which the first mist adheres. Therefore, the first mist is prevented from scattering due to the second gas flow and from flowing outside of the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An amount of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be equal to, larger or smaller than an amount of the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and shapes and compositions of the first and second gas generating agents may be the same or different from each other. Volumes of the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be the same or different from each other, and the volumes can be adjusted by the first partition wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the second partition wall <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As described above, the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is in communication with the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in communication with the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and further, the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is in communication with the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. With this structure, pressures in the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are maintained at high level, i.e., at the same level as the pressure in the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (inner space <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are disposed adjacent to each other in series in the longitudinal direction of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the hybrid inflator of the present invention, the arrangement of the first and second gas generating chambers can be varied as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> For example, the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be arranged to face each other on the opposite sides inside the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Further, for example, in the inflator housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (or the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) maybe disposed to surround the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (or the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) may be disposed to surround the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The air bag system of the present invention comprises an activation-signal outputting means including an impact sensor and a control unit, and a module case in which the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an air bag are accommodated. The hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the activation-signal outputting means (the impact sensor and the control unit) on the side of the first igniter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected and fixed by screwing the stud bolt <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> into the module case in which the air bag is mounted. In the air bag system having such a structure, it is possible to adjust an amount of gas generated in accordance with a degree of the impact, and to adjust the inflating speed of the air bag by appropriately setting the output condition of the activation signal in the activation-signal outputting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Before the hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is activated, the pressurized medium stored in the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> under a high pressure has flowed into the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which communicate with each other by means of the communication holes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> respectively, and further has flowed into the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the communication holes <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and the insides of these chambers are maintained at the same high pressure. Further, the projectile <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is mounted so as to straddle between the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the inner space <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> which are maintained at the same pressure, the malfunction is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the event of a vehicle collision, the first igniter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is ignited by the activation signal outputting means to rupture the first rupturable disc <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (fixed to the boss <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> forming the first communication hole <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>) to ignite and burn the booster agent <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thereby generating a high temperature booster gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When the pressure inside the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is increased by the generated booster gas, the projectile <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> pushed by this pressure moves to rupture the main rupturable disc <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> with the sharp tip end of the projectile <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. At that time, a portion of booster gas flows into the gas inflow space <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> due to the rupture of the main rupturable disc <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Most of the booster gas flows into the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through the flame-transferring holes <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to ignite and burn the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and a desired amount of a high temperature combustion gas (corresponding to the charged amount of first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>) is generated. At that time, since the pressurized medium has flowed into the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> so that this camber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has been maintained at a high pressure, the combustion of the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is stable. Since the flame transferring means chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are partitioned from each other by a cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a second partition wall <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is not ignited and burned. Because of the arrangement of the first communication hole <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is not ignited nor burnt by the combustion of the first gas generating agent <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, since the high temperature combustion gas flows through the first communication hole <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> into the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to increase the pressure therein, the further pressurized medium flows into the gas inflow space <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the ruptured main rupturable disc <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. The further pressurized medium which has flowed into the gas inflow space <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in this manner is ejected from the diffuser port <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> after passing through the diffuser screen <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and then, inflates the air bag mounted in the air bag module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The second ignitor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is ignited by the activation signal outputting means simultaneously when or slightly (about 10 to 40 ms)after the first ignitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is activated, and the second rupturable disc <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> (fixed to the boss <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> forming the second communication passage <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>) is ruptured to ignite and burn the booster agent <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and then, the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is ignited to generate the desired amount of a high temperature combustion gas (corresponding to the charged amount of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>). At that time, since the pressurized medium has flowed into the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and this chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has been maintained at high pressure, the combustion state of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is stable. In this case, in order to ignite and burn the second gas generating agents <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, only the igniter is used and a booster can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, since the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is disposed distantly and differently in the radial direction from the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is uniformly burned. For example, if the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is disposed near the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a portion of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> near the second igniter <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is smoothly burned, but the other portion of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> located away from the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is prone to be burned in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The high temperature combustion gas generated by the combustion of the second gas generating agent <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> flows into the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the second communication holes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> to increase a pressure therein, the remaining further pressurized medium flows into the gas inflow space <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the ruptured main rupturable disc <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, and is ejected from the diffuser port <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to further inflate the air bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The hybrid inflator described above generates the combustion gas in two stages. The first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can act to inhibit an inflating action of the air bag from lagging at a vehicle collision, and the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> enables to act the pressurized medium to be discharged completely from the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and to make the air bag inflated immediately up to the satisfying safety level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Additionally, since two gas generating chambers are provided, this hybrid inflator can also be adapted to a mode of embodiment in which a combustion gas is generated only in the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> alone, a mode of embodiment in which a combustion gas is generated in the first and second gas generating chambers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> simultaneously, and a mode of embodiment in which an interval between the timing of generating a combustion gas in the first gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and that of generating a combustion gas in the second gas generating chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is controlled in a desired manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> was produced by using high tensile strength steels (a tensile strength of 90 kg/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). As the pressurized medium, 2.6 mol (100 g) of a mixed gas comprising argon and helium &lsqb;Ar:He&equals;96:4 (molar ratio)&rsqb; was used (the internal pressure of 32,000 kPa). As the gas generating agent, 20 g of a composition comprising nitroguanidine, strontium nitrate, carboxymethylcellulose and acid clay (34:50:9:7) was used (A/B&equals;7.2/2.8) for each of the first and second gas generating chambers (40 g in total, which corresponds to 1.0 mol of the generated gas). A weight ratio (X/Y) between the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent was 2.5. Accordingly, at the activation, totally 3.6 moles of the gas could be used, and the total weight of the pressurized medium and the gas generating agent before the activation was 140 g. In this case, the pressure index (n) was 0.6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the above structure had 54 mm of the diameter and 156 mm of the length (the length not including the stud bolt whose length was 20 mm). The thickness of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> was 2.5 mm, and the total weight of the inflator was 1200 g. When this hybrid inflator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> was activated by simultaneously igniting the first and second igniters, the internal pressure of the inflator housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> was 48,000 kPa. </paragraph>
