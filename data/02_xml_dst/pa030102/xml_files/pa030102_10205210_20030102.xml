<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a thermomechanical process for planarizing a photo-patternable layer applied to a partly elevated carrier area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application with the international publication number WO 95/30276 discloses an encapsulation&mdash;which the applicant designates as PROTEC&mdash;for electronic components, in particular for components operating with surface acoustic waves&mdash;SAW components. The encapsulation has, in regions of the component structures, e.g. in regions of interdigital transducers and of optionally required acoustic attenuation masses that are usually applied using screen printing technology, recesses which accommodate the components. In one of its exemplary embodiments, the above-mentioned PCT application provides for this purpose a frame-like carrier applied to the component substrate, e.g. a piezo-electric substrate, and optionally supports on which a covering layer is disposed. In this case, the carrier, the supports and the covering layer may be formed by a sheet which, on the side of the component substrate, contains depressions spanning the component structures and is applied to the component substrate e.g. by adhesive bonding, welding or lamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further known proposal according to the PCT application, a photo-patternable material, i.e. a so-called dry resist sheet, is used for the carrier and optionally the supports. By way of example, this may be a photoresist or a material which can be patterned by UV light, and which is exposed in such a way that, after it has been developed, only the active components, in particular filter structures, the acoustic attenuation mass and the areas provided for making electrical contact with these component structures are uncovered. A second layer, namely a covering layer, is then applied to the carrier thus produced and&mdash;if present&mdash;the supports, which layer likewise contains a dry resist sheet, i.e. a photo-patternable material of the above-mentioned type, which is likewise exposed and developed after it has been applied. This material ultimately forms the recesses given sufficient thickness of the first layer containing carrier and optionally supports, together with the layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This type of encapsulation&mdash;also called PROTEC&mdash;which ultimately contains a successive application of two layers of dry resist sheets, the application in each case being correspondingly treated by phototechnology, is unsuitable for all cases in which the dry resist sheets are intended to bear directly on the acoustic attenuation mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This is because, in the case of standard lamination, the applied first layer or first dry resist sheet and, consequently, also the second layer or second dry resist sheet follow the uneven contour profile of the acoustic attenuation mass. The uneven application of the second dry resist sheet to the already unevenly bearing first dry resist sheet is unacceptable, however, since under the technically expedient lamination conditions for the second layer, the resulting encapsulations, such as e.g. coverings for chips of SAW components, are not tight. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a thermomechanical process for producing a planar resist structure, which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art devices and methods of this general type, which ensures reliable application of the second layer or dry resist sheet and thus a hermetically tight encapsulation of chips of electronic components, in particular of SAW components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, an electronic component. The electronic component is formed of a substrate, elevated structures disposed on the substrate, and a resist structure having surfaces applied above the elevated structures. The resist structure bears tightly on the substrate and the elevated structures. The resist structure has a varying layer thickness such that the surfaces of the resist structure lie substantially in one plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Only the planar resist structure according to the invention enables a further layer to be applied conformally in such a way that a good connection to the resist structure, reliable bearing on the latter and, consequently, a tight encapsulation can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the protective sheet which forms the dry resist sheet in a composite with a photosensitive layer, is a temperature-resistant sheet, i.e. a sheet which cannot be destroyed even at relatively high temperatures, then the solution provided by the process according to the invention is that the dry resist sheet is applied by its photosensitive layer to the surface of the carrier. The dry resist sheet is then treated under pressure and with heat in such a way that the photosensitive layer is planarized. The photosensitive layer is then exposed, and the protective sheet is removed and the photosensitive layer is developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If a non-temperature-resistant protective sheet is used, then the invention provides for the protective sheet, after the application of the dry resist sheet, to be drawn off from the photosensitive layer and replaced by a temperature-resistant separating sheet. The temperature-resistant separating sheet has a non-adhering layer on its surface directed toward the photosensitive layer. The separating sheet together with the photosensitive layer is treated under pressure and with heat in such a way that the photosensitive layer is planarized. The separating sheet is then removed and the photosensitive layer is exposed and developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The application or the lamination of the dry resist sheet for the first layer is done in accordance with the customary standard processes and leads to a layer free from air bubbles which follows the topography of the attenuation mass applied using screen printing technology, for example. It is only by virtue of the planarization, in which, in the case of a temperature-resistant protective sheet, the dry resist sheet together with the carrier and, in the case of a non-temperature-resistant protective sheet, the carrier coated with the photosensitive layer, together with the separating sheets, are disposed between hot plates and compressed. The viscosity of the photosensitive material of the first layer decreases, on account of the temperature increase, to such an extent that, as a result of the pressure exerted axially on the carrier, the material of this layer flows from the zones situated above the screen printing into the zones without the attenuation mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the photosensitive layer of the first layer is leveled to such an extent that, after subsequent photo-patterning, the second layer of dry resist sheet can be laminated on in a manner known per se and the resulting encapsulations, e.g. of chips of electronic components, are hermetically tight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The material is prevented from sticking to the hot plates or pressing apparatus by virtue of the adequate temperature resistance (present in any case) of the protective sheet, e.g. a polyester sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, a resist layer having a uniform layer thickness is provided that covers the resist structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the resist structure forms a frame, and the resist layer forms a cover matching the frame. The frame and the cover together form a cap-shaped covering and enclose a cavity between the substrate, the frame and the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the resist structure and the resist layer are formed from a dry resist sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the elevated structures have metalization layers and/or interconnect structures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In all the figures of the drawing, sub-features and integral parts that correspond to one another bear the same reference symbol in each case. Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> thereof, there is shown the production of a first exemplary embodiment of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) component. The SAW component is formed from a dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> laminated in a customary manner onto one surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of a piezo-electric material. In the case of customary mass production, the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a wafer, which has, in regions of its individual SAW components, acoustic attenuation masses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in each case applied using screen printing technology, for example. The dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed of a composite of a temperature-resistant protective sheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, e.g. a polyester sheet, and a photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a further step&mdash;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&mdash;the wafer thus coated is disposed between heating plates <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of a pressure apparatus and the dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is planarized&mdash;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>&mdash;under pressure&mdash;see arrows F. Due to the heat, the photosensitive material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as viewed in arrow direction A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), partly flows into the zones that are free of the attenuation masses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed, the protective sheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is drawn off and the exposed photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is developed, thereby concluding the production process for the first PROTEC layer, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The starting product that is used for producing the second PROTEC layer, required for creating the complete encapsulation, is once again a dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the constitution mentioned above, which is applied by its photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; to the developed planar layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a manner known per se, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. After which the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is exposed, a protective sheet <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is removed and the exposed photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, instead of the above-mentioned dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; for the second PROTEC layer with the temperature-resistant protective sheet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, it is possible to apply to the developed layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> a dry resist sheet which has a non-temperature-resistant protective sheet, e.g. polyolefin sheet. In this case, with insufficient transmission for the wavelengths used, the photosensitive layer can only be exposed after the protective sheet has been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For the final encapsulation, after the application and development of the second photosensitive layer, the developed layers are cured e.g. by UV radiation and/or thermally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the method in accordance with the exemplary embodiment according to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, use is made of a dry resist sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the first PROTEC layer which contains a composite of a non-temperature-resistant protective sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, e.g. a polyolefin sheet, with a photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&mdash;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. On account of its insufficient heat resistance, the protective sheet must be removed before the planarization (already explained)&mdash;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>&mdash;and replaced by a temperature-resistant separating sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, e.g. a polyester sheet. On its surface directed toward the carrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the separating sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has e.g. a silicone layer or a polytetrafluoroethylene layer (PTFE layer) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which, during the subsequent planarization, see FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, prevents the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from sticking to the heating plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and enables the later removal of the separating sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After planarization has been carried out, then&mdash;as has already been described with reference to the first exemplary embodiments&mdash;the separating sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is removed and then the photosensitive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed and developed, thereby creating the first PROTEC layer of the encapsulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Depending on the sheet used, the second PROTEC layer is once again produced in one of the ways that have already been described for the first exemplary embodiment, which results in that it is not necessary to explain these production steps again. </paragraph>
