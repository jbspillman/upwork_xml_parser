<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to casino games and, in particular, to improvements in the apparatus and methods of enhancing continued play on slot machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Statement of the Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Slot machines are very popular to the gaming public. The following sequence of events typically occurs during play of conventional slot machines. The player wagers an amount (e.g., either by credit or coin) after which the reels are spun (either automatically, or manually by the player). Upon completion of the reel-spin, as appropriate, winning combinations are awarded. The slot machine then remains idle until the next wager and game. Often, during the reel-spin phase of the game, a musical melody is played which ends upon completion of that game. The music is a cute and enjoyable accompaniment to the reel-spin, hence it is almost universally applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Several difficulties exist with the current approach. First, the stoppage of music implies a definitive end to the game. Psychologically, there is no incentive for the player to continue to play additionally. This is because the machine enters a passive or idle condition and all cues, both visual and auditory, confirm this state. Additionally, the repetition of replaying the same short snippet of music, game after game can get monotonous to the player, neighboring players and casino personnel. Alternatively, should it be desirable to play a musical selection of length longer than that of the reel spin, that desired selection will necessarily have &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; during the periods of time when the machine is passive or idle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Slot machines traditionally include lights, bright colors and chrome to attract and stimulate play. Often, the slot machine has a flashing or steady, &ldquo;INSERT COIN&rdquo; signal to attract play. Visual inducement is common, recognized and somewhat effective. Those that are familiar, with casinos know that many slot machines are strategically positioned to attract play. Often sight lines and travel paths through casinos are intentionally made circuitous to arrest the attention of players and induce play. Competition, between manufactures of casino gaming equipment, for floor space is fierce so there is a continuing need for slot improvements, particularly when these machines are passive or idle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many manufactures include light and sound as well as rolling progressive meters to attract players to machines not currently being played. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,376 has a system that operates when additional coins are not in play. Attraction mode lights and sound effects can be run periodically. U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,361 has a timer for a reservation feature that allows a player to interrupt his play and return to the machine later, resuming play where he left off. Upon entry of the reservation code, a timer is started and the machine enters the reserved mode in which no other player may use the game. The player then removes his card and may leave the machine. When the player who reserved the game reinserts his card, play may again resume. If the player does not return in a predetermined length of time, e.g., 10 minutes, the reservation feature times out and the game returns to the attract mode. The reservation mode may also be canceled by insertion of an employee card into the card reader. Employees may also invoke the reservation feature without a time limit. U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,261 has a feature for when the game is not in use, the pinball component, the rotary wheel, and/or the fourth reel can be set to an attract mode wherein a message is displayed to potential players or play is simulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Previously, AC Coin has implemented a game in which the player is &ldquo;racing against the clock&rdquo; to achieve a desirable conclusion. Typically, the clock runs while the reels are spinning, and terminates very shortly thereafter. Thus, a player who repeatedly plays successive games with no delay in between will fare better than a player who repeatedly plays successive games with, say, a 2 second delay in between. In this sense, the &ldquo;clock&rdquo; is an integral part of the overall house advantage. This penalizes players who, despite playing continuously, are not inclined to play &ldquo;rapid fire&rdquo; games, with the accompanying risk of rapid losses. No patent on that feature has been found. Conversely, the present disclosure addresses situations wherein the game has ended but the entertainment lingers on. Consequently, the need to keep the player at the machine being played is addresses by the disclosure herein presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 3. Solution to the Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The solution as presented herein involves a slot machine capable of providing a continuing secondary event to entertain during and thereafter between games thereby encouraging additional or continued play. The continuing secondary event is preferably audible and therefore able to compete with casino sounds coming from the active slot machines and table games. Using music as the audible continuing secondary event is the most preferred embodiment. Provided the player or a subsequent player, upon completion of a previous game, initiates a new game within a predetermined period of time, the music will continue uninterrupted. Should the player fail to initiate a new game within the predetermined period of time, the music stops. This is distinguished from current gaming equipment that uses music, video, lights, meters and/or the like to attract players when the equipment is idle. The timing of the continuing secondary event attraction is important to the beneficial results of the present device and method. That is to say that, the length of the period of time for the operation of the continuing secondary event can be varied for particular circumstances or unusual situations. The start of the continuing secondary event is a function of the operation of the particular equipment to which it is applied. More particularly, initiation of the continuing secondary event can be no sooner than the play of the game and for some machines that is when the wager is committed. That is to say that when the player can no longer get the coin returned without winning play. Some progressive slot machines measure the progressive wager before the coin is no longer returnable. Recognition of coin in by the machine, depending on the particular piece of equipment, results in a pulse sent from the computer. In other machines a packet of pulses represent a bet of a plurality of credits. In any event the start of the continuing secondary event can not begin until a player has committed to a wager, can not retrieve the bet or put another way the play of the next game has started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The exact time for starting the continuing secondary event can still vary widely after the wager is placed. For example, the initiation may occur when the player first wins more than is bet or after a preset time or upon the appearance of a certain symbol. Machine appreciation of the player&apos;s tenacity or anything special can set the start of the continuing event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The continuing secondary event is also preferably called and considered secondary, hence it is not directly related to the overall house advantage. That is, the continuing secondary event is completely separate from the mathematically calculated return from the game. Consequently, the continuously available continuing secondary event could only indirectly act to increase continued play by minimizing idle or passive slot machine time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The teachings herein provide several advantages. First, the player is encouraged to play and to continue to play after the completion of each game. The player, by doing so, ensures that uninterrupted music, video or a combination thereof continues to be presented for enjoyment. By virtue of the predetermined time interval in which the next game must be played, the player is also subtly encouraged to play again in a timely manner, so as not to interrupt a particular musical selection, video presentation or combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that the player is encouraged to play again, but does not need to do so in a rushed, or hurried, capacity. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the predetermined time interval may be of order two seconds, allowing the player to pause slightly in between games with no associated penalty. Of course, the length of the period of time can be adjustable at the option of the casino operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is well known also that many slot players &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; from machine to machine, playing a short while at a particular machine, and leaving thereafter. As one measure of slot machine performance is the volume of betting it receives, it is a further advantage of this invention that individuals are less inclined to &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; from a machine wherein a continuing secondary event lingers after each game to fill the predetermined period of time between games. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that a long musical selection may be played, uninterrupted, for the player&apos;s enjoyment. Indeed, the musical selection may be any length and may envelop many games on the slot machine, provided the player continues to initiate games within the afforded predetermined time interval between games. The use of a longer musical selection is desirable as it avoids the invariability of a short snippet of music and adds variety to the overall experience of playing the slot machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a most preferred embodiment, the continuing secondary event is purely secondary, hence unrelated to the mathematical underpinnings of the slot machine. That is to say, the player&apos;s and the casino&apos;s expected returns from the game are not directly affected by the continuing secondary event. Except as explained herein before. Thus, whether or not the player initiates an additional game within the allotted predetermined time interval will not changes the player&apos;s win. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the player is allowed to choose the musical selection that will play. This further allows the player to enjoy the slot playing experience, through the use of uninterrupted music that the player enjoys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Frequent slot players often join a casino&apos;s slot club and receive a slot club card. These cards, when inserted, usually welcome the player by name. Too, players often refer to a particular slot machine as &ldquo;my machine.&rdquo; The audible continuing secondary event disclosed herein could be integrated with the player&apos;s card to automatically select the music the player enjoys the most. More broadly by drawing information from the player&apos;s card to provide a player preferred continuing secondary event. In this way, the player senses a more personal relationship with both the slot machine and a preference for the casino. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A device may include the continuing secondary event between games on a slot machine. A first means can initiate the continuing secondary event during play of a game upon completion of the game. The first means is preferably in a computer of the game, as for example, a slot machine or table game. The computer could also set the rules of the game, the payout for winning events and might include a random number generator. The first means can be an instruction in the computer that starts the audio, video or other specific form of continuing secondary event entertainment for the player. The instruction can be set to begin the continuing secondary event at the initiation of play or at some random time during play or after a winning event, as desired. The computer may include a memory to be accessed for the entertainment or the computer can be linked directly to a casino storage unit that contains prerecorded programming. Direct linkage may include hard wire or radio frequency transmission. The continuing secondary event preferably continues once it is initiated until after game play ceases for a predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A third means for stopping the continuing secondary event is in the computer and should the player not begin to play an additional game within the predetermined period of time the first means is barred. A timer, in the preferred embodiment, couples to the computer. The timer starts when there is a break in the continuing play of the game. The exact parameter sensed and a transducer for that purpose are a function of the particular game and the configuration of the platform for the specific game. Once interruption of play is sensed, the timer starts and runs for the predetermined period of time. The timer couples with the first means to continue the continuing secondary event if the player begins play of an additional game within a predetermined period of time. Any form of time measuring device can be used to end the continuation period from capacitate discharge to sensing a break in the particular entertainment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In particular, the computer can disconnect the first means or reduce the output of the continuing secondary event to a level that is imperceptible to the player. This is particularly so if the second means for continuing the continuing secondary event includes an audio apparatus for an audible continuing secondary event. It is perhaps preferable to start and stop the continuing secondary event so that it picks up where it left off and the reinforcement is accorded the continuing player. The audio apparatus includes prerecorded music, stories or information of interest to the player. The audio apparatus may include a control for choosing the musical selection that will be played to suit the player. A player card reader can be included for integrating the continuing secondary event with information from the player&apos;s profile to automatically select the music for the audio apparatus that the player enjoys the most. More broadly by drawing information from a player&apos;s card to provide a player preferred continuing secondary event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second means for continuing secondary event can be a video apparatus for a visual continuing secondary event. The second means can have apparatuses for audio and video for a combined continuing secondary event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A device provides a continuing secondary event until after the ending of a casino game. Then the device has means for continuing the continuing secondary event if the player begins play of an additional game within a predetermined period of time. The computer is used to perform the functions of the means for continuing. Another means is for stopping the continuing secondary event should the player fail to begin play of the additional game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The means for continuing the continuing secondary event may include an apparatus for providing musical entertainment. The means for continuing the continuing secondary event may include the timer coupled for providing informational entertainment for a predetermined period of time.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a typical slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including a continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after a game or between games on the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided to hold a player&apos;s interest. Reference to continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> is the device and the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Slot machines <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> include computers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to, among other features, control the operation of the game by including a random number generator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, rules of play and pay table information <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, instructions, record keeping and auditing memory and signaling systems for operating <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Computers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are capable of storing and playing audio and video material of a wide variety of types for purposes of informing and entertaining. Whole libraries of that material can be digitized and kept in a small easily changed file for automatic access and playback or may be in the form of a picture within the picture on the video apparatus <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has the stored library, playback and access equipment for selective use in accord with the methods of the operation of a continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between games on the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> At the completion of a game or between games of the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> therein begins a timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which runs for a preset period during which the continuing secondary event takes place. The timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is started when a particular occurrence in the sequence of slot machine game play has concluded. For example, operations such as the credits are registered, a preset time has passed since the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was active or the pay out has been completed. During that period of time the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enables the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to supply continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the preferred form of informational and/or entertain material of an audio and or video format, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>. Such material is provided in limited amounts, for brief time intervals, to stimulate the player to continue. Failure, on the player&apos;s part, to play on results in the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> expiration and the end of the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Reference to flow diagram <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and circuit diagram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be helpful in following the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The player controls continuing secondary event enhancement of the excitement, of the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the recent competitive field of thematic slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> games with the appeal of different games, challenges and stimuli manufacturers of machines and designers of games seek to obtain every advantage to assure play of their equipment. Most if not all slot machines <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include a receptacle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for a magnetically encoded player&apos;s card <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> currency acceptor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown to receive money <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and establish credits to start the game, via line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Cards <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are used to welcome the player and indicate the number of points accumulated in the account thereof and/or time remaining during a playing session at a screen <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The casino is thus informed of the player&apos;s visit and activity level for purposes of delivering comps and perks. Casino record keeping associated with the player&apos;s card and the identification database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can optionally be used to provide specific informational and/or entertain material of an audio and or video personalized to the individual playing in a casino&apos;s database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In particular, the player could select a specific form of information or entertainment desired and that could be encoded on the player&apos;s card <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of in the casino&apos;s database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for access by the slot machine computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could, at the outset of play, query the player as to the desired choice of continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Perhaps the player likes Broadway, popular, jazz or rap music and that could be selected before or changed during play. The information could be the uninterrupted flow of trivia or upcoming casino opportunities, e.g., tournaments, shows or banquets. The entertainment might be tactile including a massage or heated chair, aroma therapy, selected and individual temperature or fan regulation. Skilled artisans will no doubt fathom many different ways to enhance the player&apos;s comfort and enjoyment. The particular continuing secondary event selected or provided need only be of sufficient interest to the player to encourage continued play. The timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> period expires and the continuing secondary event and is inevitable should player discontinue to compete on the slot machine. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will includes the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or is operationally coupled thereto. Consequently, the player&apos;s failure to play after the period of time preset and provided by the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will deactivate the systems for operating and in particular, the computer&apos;s <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> delivery of selected audio and video material of a wide variety of types for purposes of informing and entertaining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for employing the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between games on the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a first means such as computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for initiating the continuing secondary event during play of a game. The first means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any form of computer, or information programmed into the software of the computer or instructions from memory in the controls of the device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is broadly any casino game, be it a slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with reels or video slot including card games like poker or blackjack as well as table games (not shown but well known). The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, among other things, also sets the rules of the game <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the payout for winning events and includes the random number generator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The first means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be in the form of any instructions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that starts the audio, video or other specific form of information or entertainment for the player. The instructions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, as explained, can be set to begin at the initiation of play, at a random time or after a winning event, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be accessed for the information or entertainment or the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be linked directly to a casino storage unit or database <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that may contain audio, video or a combination thereof in the form of information or entertainment programs. Direct linkage <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can include hard wires, digital telecommunications or radio frequency transmissions. The continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> continues once it is initiated until after game play ceases for at least a predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in or coupled to the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is started when ever there is a break in the ongoing timely play of the game. As known to skilled artisans, the exact parameter sensed and the transducer for that purpose would be a function of the particular game and the configuration of a platform for a specific game. Once interruption of play is sensed, the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is started and runs for the predetermined period of time. The timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> coupled with the first means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> maintains the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> only if the player begins play of an additional game within the predetermined period of time. Any form of time measuring device can be used to end the continuation period including capacitor discharge circuits, clocks or to the sensing of a break in the particular entertainment or information provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A third means for stopping the continuing secondary event could in one embodiment include a comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thus used to compare the predetermined period of time from timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to calculate the elapsed time. Should the player not begin play of an additional game within the predetermined period of time, the first means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is barred. In particular, the first means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shut off to reduce the output of the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through either line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to a level that is imperceptible to the player. This is particularly so if the second means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for maintaining the continuing secondary event includes audio apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. It is perhaps preferable to start and stop the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that it picks up where it left off for reinforcement of the influence accorded to the continuing player. The comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> would check repeatedly the predetermined period time against the amount of time that has passed since the last game played and when that is equal end the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The audio apparatus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may include prerecorded music, stories or information of interest to the player. The audio apparatus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> perhaps includes a control <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> for choosing the musical selection that will play by manual selection of the player. Alternatively, player card reader <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be included and used for integrating the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with information from the player&apos;s card <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to automatically select the music for the audio apparatus that the player enjoys the most through, for example connections <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the selection of any other form of entertainment may be made manually or automatically by drawing information from a player&apos;s card to provide a player preferred continuing secondary event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For example, the second means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can have video apparatus including screen <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference> for a visual continuing secondary event. The second means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for continuing can include entertainment apparatuses for audio <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and video <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for a combined continuing secondary event. The video apparatus <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be the same as used to play the game or may be separate and if the former can use a picture within a picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An alternate device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, circumscribed by a dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, provides continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until after the ending of a casino game and then the alternate device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be entirely within the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for continuing the continuing secondary event if the player begins play of an additional game within a predetermined period of time. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to perform the functions of the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and comparator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for continuing. Another means <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may also be in or coupled to the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Means <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is for stopping the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> should the player fail to begin play of the additional game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for continuing the continuing secondary event includes apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for providing musical entertainment. The means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for continuing the continuing secondary event has the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> coupled to audio and video equipment <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> respectively, for providing informational entertainment for the period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of one embodiment of the hardware configuration for the secondary event between games of the present invention. Gaming machines such as slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are conventionally available and any of a number of such conventional gaming machines could be used. The conventional casinos gaming equipment for accepting wagers, accounting for and displaying credits during the play of the game, activating play of the game, ending the game and delivering pay outs to players, are all well known in the industry. Upon the occurrence of an end-game state in the play of the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a signal is generated and sent on line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a microprocessor-based controller capable of handling timing as well as input/output via a data flow manager with specific protocol. Such a slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is sold, under the name SMIB by Mikohn Gaming of Las Vegas, Nev., assignee of this invention. The slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in turn is connected via signal line <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to an event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has control over the actual secondary event (e.g., music) and for example, may be a modified music player, e.g. CD player, tape deck or digital memory capable of being turned off and on based on signals over line <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses a game processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The game processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is conventional in the gaming industry and may be any suitable computer that functionally performs the teachings of the present invention as described herein. The processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in a well-known manner, communicates with the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> over lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The details of the communication paths showing buffers, modems, data protocols, etc. is immaterial to the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Upon beginning play, the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> communicates a game start signal over one of the lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> communicates a secondary event start signal over one of the lines <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> initiates the secondary event (e.g., music starts playing). Upon completing game play, the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> communicates a game end signal over one of the lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> invokes a timer upon receiving the game end signal Such the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is conventionally associated with controllers, and the implementation of such a timer is readily apparent to one skilled in the art. If the timer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should reach a predetermined limit (say, 3 seconds) without the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receiving a further game start signal over one of the lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, then the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> issues a secondary event stop signal over one of the lines <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> thus terminates the secondary event (e.g., music stops playing). On the other hand, should the slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receive a further game start signal within predetermined time limit, then no further action is taken, and the event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is allowed to continue to operate uninterrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While the hardware description has been given in terms of specific components, including a game processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, slot machine interface board <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and event device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, it is expressly understood that two or more of the components could be combined into one device. For example, the game processor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> could serve the dual purpose of game control and interface to the event device. Other representations and configurations are also possible. The preceding is meant to be illustrative and in no way limit the teachings as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A method of employing the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between games on the slot machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has steps including initiating the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during play of a game best shown in the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Upon completion of the game, the step of continuing the continuing secondary event if the player begins play of an additional game within a predetermined period of time ensues. Then the step of stopping the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> if the player does not begin play of an additional game within a predetermined period of time occurs. The step of continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is an audible continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at speakers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. While speakers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are shown, the use of headphones or an ear piece, perhaps even those belonging to the player, and brought to the casino by the player could be accommodated by a special jack included on the game at a place accessible to the player. The step of audible continuing secondary event includes the step of providing music. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The method, as depicted in the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, entertains with the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after the step of concluding a casino game The method includes the step of continuing the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so long as the player follows the step of beginning an additional game within a predetermined period of time. The step of ending the continuing secondary event <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> occurs if the player fails to play an additional game within a predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> While the claimed method is disclosed in connection with slot machines, the claims that follow seek to protect any of the many casino games. The method may be used with other casino machines including horse races, keno, twenty-one, poker, etc. Although the terms, &ldquo;continuing secondary event&rdquo; as used throughout, would suggest that there is but two events, skilled artisans understand that the context of this presentation is not purely a numerical designation of the event or chronological indication of its occurrence. Any event that is timed to encourage continued play else the event ends would fit within the scope of the protection sought. </paragraph>
