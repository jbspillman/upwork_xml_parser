<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is in the field of antiinflammatory pharmaceutical agents and specifically relates to a crystalline form of 4-&lsqb;5-methyl-3-phenylisoxazol-4-yl&rsqb;benzenesulfonamide, methods of preparing the crystalline form, pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) associated disorders, including inflammation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Prostaglandins play a major role in the inflammation process and the inhibition of prostaglandin production, especially production of PGG<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, PGH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and PGE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, has been a common target of antiinflammatory drug discovery. However, common non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are active in reducing the prostaglandin-induced pain and swelling associated with the inflammation process are also active in affecting other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with the inflammation process. Thus, use of high doses of most common NSAIDs can produce severe side effects, including life threatening ulcers, that limit their therapeutic potential. An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteroids, which have even more drastic side effects, especially when long term therapy is involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Previous NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway, including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). The recent discovery of an inducible enzyme associated with inflammation (named &ldquo;cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)&rdquo; or &ldquo;prostaglandin G/H synthase II&rdquo;) provides a viable target of inhibition which more effectively reduces inflammation and produces fewer and less drastic side effects related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A group of substituted isoxazoles are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,272, to Talley et al., and International Application WO96/25405. The compounds are described to be useful for the treatment of inflammation and inflammation-associated disorders. 4-&lsqb;5-Methyl-3-phenylisoxazol-4-yl&rsqb;benzenesulfonamide shows potential as a selective inhibitor of COX-2 over COX-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With all pharmaceutical compounds and compositions, the chemical and physical stability of a drug compound is important in the commercial development of that drug substance. Such stability includes the stability at ambient conditions, especially to moisture and under storage conditions. Elevated stability at different conditions of storage is needed to anticipate the different possible storage conditions during the lifetime of a commercial product. A stable drug avoids the use of special storage conditions as well as frequent inventory replacement. A drug compound must also be stable during the manufacturing process which often requires milling of the drug to achieve drug material with uniform particle size and surface area. Unstable materials often undergo polymorphic changes. Therefore, any modification of a drug substance which enhances its stability profile provides a meaningful benefit over less stable substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has now been discovered that 4-&lsqb;5-methyl-3-phenylisoxazol-4-yl&rsqb;benzenesulfonamide can be prepared in different crystal forms. An earlier material (Form &ldquo;A&rdquo;) is unstable after mechanical grinding (milling) and is also thermally unstable. A recently determined crystalline form (Form &ldquo;B&rdquo;) is described which is more stable and has improved physical properties. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Melting </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Melting points were performed either on a Thomas Hoover melting point apparatus or a Mettler FP900 Thermosystem melting point apparatus. Melting ranges were determined by differential scanning calorimetry on a TA Instruments Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Model 2100 controller, Model 912 dual calorimeter). The sample (1-2 mg) was placed in an unsealed aluminum pan and heated at 10&deg; C./minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Form A showed an onset of melting at 160.2&deg; C. with an imbedded exotherm at 170.9&deg; C. due to crystal rearrangement (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Form B showed an onset of melting at 170.9&deg; C. (peak 172.5&deg; C.). An example of the DSC of Form B is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Infrared Spectroscopy </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Infrared spectra were obtained with a Nicolet DRIFT (diffused reflectance infrared fourier transform) Magna System 550 spectrophotometer. A Spectra-Tech Collector system and a 3 mm sample cup were used. Samples (2%) were analyzed in KBr and scanned from 400 to 4000 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. An example of an infrared absorption spectra of Form B is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and that of Form A is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The Y-axis represents corrected reflectance in Kubella-Munk units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The infrared spectrum of Form B is characterized by absorptions at about 3377, 1170, 1151, 925, 844, 745, 729, and 534 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>which are different than that observed in the Form A spectra. The infrared spectrum of Form A is characterized in part by an absorption at about 723 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>which is different than that observed in the Form B spectra. Form B crystals of the present invention preferably display an infrared spectrum substantially the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Step 1. Preparation of deoxybenzoin oxime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Sodium acetate trihydrate (152.5 g, 1.12 mole, 1.1 eq.) was added to deoxybenzoin (200 g, 1.02 mole) and dissolved with ethanol (3A, 0.8L) and water (0.24L) in a 5L flask with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer. The solution was stirred and heated to 70&plusmn;1&deg; C. Water (0.1L) was added to hydroxylamine hydrochloride (78.0 g, 1.12 mole, 1.1 eq.) in a separate 500 ML flask with stirring. The hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution was transferred to the deoxybenzoin solution, while the reaction mixture was kept at about 70&deg; C. The mixture was heated to boiling (about 84&deg; C.) and held at this temperature for 40 minutes. The mixture was cooled to 40&deg; C. in two hours and charged water (10.5L) into the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was cooled to 20&deg; C. over another hour with stirring. Crystals of pure oxime formed which were isolated by filtration (Buchner funnel, No.1 Whatman filter paper) using house vacuum, washed with a mixture of 50 mL of 3A ethanol and 100 mL of water, and with water (1L). The solid was dried with vacuum for 2 hours, and at 55&deg; C. under house vacuum for 12 hours to yield pure deoxybenzoin oxime (213.2 g, 99%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Step 2. Preparation of 5-hydroxy-5-methyl-3,4-diphenylisoxazoline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The deoxybenzoin oxime (Step 1) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (565 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was cooled to &minus;20&deg; C. The solution was treated with lithium diisopropylamide (2 M, 800 mL, 1.60 mol) while allowing the reaction temperature to warm to 10-15&deg; C. The reaction mixture to was cooled to &minus;10&deg; C. to &minus;20&deg; C. and anhydrous ethyl acetate (218 mL) was added to the solution while allowing the reaction temperature to rise to a maximum of 25&deg; C. and held for 30 minutes at 25&deg; C. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 0&deg; C. Water was added to a quench flask and cooled to 0-5&deg; C. The pre-cooled reaction mixture was transferred from the reaction flask to the quench flask while maintaining the temperature of the quench mixture below 25&deg; C. The quenched mixture was cooled to 0-5&deg; C. Hydrochloric acid (12 M) was added to the mixture, keeping the temperature below 25&deg; C. during the addition by controlling the addition rate and stirred until all the solids dissolve (&tilde;5 minutes). The pH of the stirred mixture was measured to be pH 3-4. The layers were separated and the organic layer was removed. Heptane was added to the organic layer with stirring. The organic layer was distilled until the pot temperature reached 90-91&deg; C. The solution was cooled to 5&deg; C. and filtered. The solid was washed with two 300 mL portions of ethyl acetate-heptane (20/80), cooled to 5&deg; C. The solid product was dried on the funnel for several hours then dried at ambient under vacuum with a nitrogen sweep over the weekend to yield the isoxazoline (108.75 g, 57.7%). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Also embraced within this invention is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising crystalline Form B in association with one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. Form B of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The active Form B and compositions may, for example, be administered orally, intravascularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or topically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The amount of therapeutically active compound that is administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compound and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed, and thus may vary widely. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain active ingredients in the range of about 0.1 to 2000 mg, preferably in the range of about 0.5 to 500 mg and most preferably between about 1 and 100 mg. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.5 and about 20 mg/kg body weight and most preferably between about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case of psoriasis and other skin conditions, it may be preferable to apply a topical preparation of Form B to the affected area two to four times a day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For inflammations of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream, or as a suppository, containing the active ingredients in a total amount of, for example, 0.075 to 30% w/w, preferably 0.2 to 20% w/w and most preferably 0.4 to 15% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulation may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Form B can also be administered by a transdermal device. Preferably topical administration will be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which is in contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and predetermined flow of the active agent is administered to the recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating agent may also function as the membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate, among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.
