<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A mechanical seal is a shaft sealing device that contains process fluids within a pump or other type of rotating equipment. There are generally three types of mechanical seals: component seals made of several pieces; cartridge seals, made of one piece; and split seals. Cartridge seals generally are preferred over component seals because cartridge seals may be installed without significant training and may be tested before shipping to ensure reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pumps and mechanical seals are utilized by many industries and serve a variety of functions by moving process fluids throughout a plant. For example, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing, petroleum, chemical and oil refining, utilities, and food processing, are among the more significant industries that utilize significant numbers of pumps and associated mechanical seals. Within a large processing plant there may be thousands of different pumps and associated seals, moving a variety of process fluids throughout the plant. The loss of any individual pump within the plant may cause a degradation in the plant output, profitability and efficiency. It also is common for a plant to be reconfigured either to process different products or to provide a work around to avoid a damaged pump. This reconfiguration may result in incompatible combinations of equipment and process fluids and an increased likelihood of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Proper selection, installation, maintenance, operation and failure analysis of rotating equipment, and in particular pumps and mechanical seals, within a processing plant are factors in the reliability, productivity, efficiency and profitability of a processing plant, but are difficult. For example, the selection process of a seal involves the consideration of several factors, such as the operating conditions of the pump, the process fluid to be moved, the type of pump on which the seal is to be installed, and the environmental conditions under which the pump and seal operates. Other factors include the cost and quality of the seal and its ease of installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The selection process typically involves a seal or pump manufacturer&apos;s trained sales engineers with factory support to ensure that a proper seal is selected. Several standards have been promulgated to establish guidelines for seal selection. These standards include the Society of Tribologists and Lubricating Engineer (STLE) SP-30 1990 and its updated version in April 1994, the CMA/STLE &ldquo;Mechanical Seal Application Guide&rdquo; (1994), and the American Petroleum Institute (API) Mechanical Seal Standard 1994. The sales engineer typically has training in mechanical or chemical engineering and is provided by the manufacturer with at least some of the technical data corresponding to the seal or pump products. The sales engineer&apos;s effectiveness also may relate to experience in a particular industry. For example, a sales engineer that is experienced in the petroleum industry may not be as effective as proposing solutions for a food processing plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Often the selection process is a manual process, prone to errors in communication and understanding between supplier and customer. In addition to communications problems, the different levels of experience among the sales engineers may lead to confusion when different sales engineers working for the same manufacturer make different recommendations based on their experience and understanding of the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Even if the selection process is accurate for given conditions, improper installation, operation or maintenance of the pump and seals may degrade the operation. A lack of trained personnel often is a factor in improper installation, operation and maintenance of a mechanical seal or pump. In particular, it is possible that a sales engineer without proper training may select an improper seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Performance of equipment also should be monitored. To ensure that equipment is operating with acceptable performance, a disciplined, problem solving approach to pump and seal operation and maintenance is used. This disciplined problem solving approach can be divided into eight areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The first area is defining an acceptable seal performance metric. By choosing a performance metric that is appropriate for an installation seal, performance can be measured and determined. A performance metric may be, for example, a federal, state, or local government regulation, e.g., limiting emissions from the seal, or the metric may be a measure of frequency or cost of failure, such as a mean time between failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The second area is troubleshooting the equipment in the field. Visual observations of the equipment and seal, the seal support system, the piping system, etc. can provide important information and data for later analysis. It also may be possible to provide corrective actions for solving the problem or failure without shutting the equipment down. Examples of such corrective actions include tightening gland bolts and adjusting a quench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The third area is reviewing the current process and equipment data, along with the repair history for the equipment. This information can provide data on changing conditions that have negatively impacted seal reliability. Because the configuration of the processing plant changes often, it is difficult to maintain data about the configuration of the plant up to date. Modifications to equipment and changes to process fluids commonly occur. Processing plant reliability managers commonly do not have a convenient and timely method of determining the current state of equipment in a plant. In addition, because of the lack of information regarding the current state of equipment within the plant, the plant reliability manager often has inadequate information for cost and failure analysis. Life cycle costs (LCC) and mean time between failure (MTBF) are commonly used metrics to determine the efficiency and productivity of plant equipment. LCC involves tracking the costs associated with a particular pump and/or seal over a given period of time. MTBF involves tracking the time between failures of the particular piece of machinery. Without accurate up to date information on the current state of a piece of equipment, however, these measures cannot be computed accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The fourth area is proper selection of pumps and seals. As pointed out above, seal selection generally is a technically difficult and manual process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The fifth area is investigating the operational history of the pump and mechanical seal and related equipment. Such an investigation may reveal operating conditions that are incompatible with a seal or pump or other equipment. For example, operating conditions such as pressure, environmental or process fluid temperatures, etc. may deviate significantly from normal operating conditions. By analyzing these deviations from normal operating conditions, the cause of a failure may be determined to have been due to the operating conditions and not due to a mechanical failure. In addition to any data from instrumentation, the personnel responsible for operating the equipment may provide valuable data about any deviations that have occurred and why these deviations occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The sixth area is performing seal analysis after a failure. Disassembly and inspection of a seal helps to understand the failure mode of the seal. There may be mechanical, thermal, or chemical damage to the seal. Information about the failure mode helps to understand the underlying root cause of the failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The seventh area is performing a root cause analysis to assign the ultimate underlying cause of the failure based on gathered failure data. The data that has been gathered is analyzed and, based on individual experience and scientific analysis, the root cause of the failure is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The eighth area is implementing a corrective action plan and providing drawings, installation, operation procedures and training to personnel. Monitoring the work performed and updating the equipment databases also may be included in an action plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Failure analysis of a rotating equipment therefore is a complex and difficult activity. Often, the processing plant is dependent upon the seal or pump manufacturer to aid in this analysis. The involvement of a manufacturer in the analysis of the cause of a failure of equipment may lead to biased results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are other problems with current methods of failure analysis. Even without bias, the analysis is still dependent upon knowledge and experience of the analyst, and thus involves training and retaining personnel. Failure analysis performed in a plant also may fail to consider the pump and seal as part of a system, because a failure typically is examined as an isolated event independent of other considerations. Because of the level of human involvement in the failure analysis, the analysis tends to be experiential rather than scientific. Thus, the analysis is only as good as the experience and insight of the people involved. Without a disciplined approach to gathering data and a scientific basis for analysis, only the symptoms of the failure are addressed and not the underlying root cause of the problem. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The various limitations of the conventional mechanical seal failure analysis methods are overcome by providing a scientifically based process for gathering, synthesizing, and analyzing data relating to equipment failure. In particular, data indicating the current state of the equipment is gathered and verified prior to a failure occurring so that accurate information is available. After a failure or problem occurs, data about the problem or failure are methodically gathered to aid in the scientific determination of the root cause of the failure. In particular, visual images of failure modes are provided to the user to ensure that proper and accurate data are obtained. A user also is directed to gather other data about the failure and the system. After data relating to the problem or failure has been gathered, the data are synthesized and a scientific analysis is performed to determine the root cause of the failure or problem.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Failure analysis of rotating equipment is performed using a computer system that guides data collection, synthesizes collected data, and automates data analysis for analyzing failure of the rotating equipment. Rotating equipment includes pumps and seals and associated parts. Examples of associated parts include the drive motor, any mechanical coupling, bearings, mechanical packing, environmental controls, supply tanks, flow meters, throat bushings in stuffing box, heat exchangers, cyclone separators, pressure regulators, low level alarms, and pressure switches. The computer system automates the root cause analysis of the failure using a methodical process of data collection and analysis. A corrective action corresponding to the root cause of the failure for repairing or replacing the rotating equipment also is determined. The computer system also provides an automated Request for Quote (RFQ) function through which the computer system provides engineering and other data to suppliers or consultants. These suppliers or consultants may respond electronically to the RFQ with recommendations, price quotes, or actual offers for sale of equipment to undertake the corrective action. The computer system also may provide installation instructions, engineering drawings, safety data, and training information for personnel. The apparatus also may provide plant performance data, for example for the system, equipment and personnel. Quantifiable plant performance data for the system, equipment and personnel can be obtained by tracking failures of individual pieces of equipment, and by tracking the work performed by individual departments and the individuals within those departments. Thus, the personnel responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance and repair of rotating equipment provide the data for assessing plant performance. The collected performance data may be analyzed so that problems in equipment, training or performance may be identified and addressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of one embodiment of a plant reliability system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, equipment data module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> stores data indicative of, for example, the characteristics of a piece of equipment, the operational environment in which the equipment operates, and the maintenance history and life cycle costs associated with a piece of equipment. New equipment data, or changes to existing equipment data, are provided to the equipment data module through input <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Output <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can provide a user or external device with an output of all or a part of the stored data associated with a piece of equipment. As will be explained in more detail below, the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes a comprehensive listing of failure modes that may be associated with equipment failures, problems, or other leakage modes of auxiliary equipment attached to the mechanical seal or pump, a list of root causes corresponding to the various failure modes, and a list of corrective actions corresponding to the list of root causes. Thus, if data indicates a characteristic of a failure of rotating equipment, a failure mode can be identified, a root cause of the failure mode can be determined, and a corrective action can be determined to correct the failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives data indicative of the characteristics of the failure or problem through input <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, this data may include failure mode data or data collected by the user about the rotating equipment. The seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is coupled to the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via connection <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and receives the problem/failure data from the data base <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The problem/failure data that is most consistent with the input data is selected. The seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> determines the failure mode from the problem/failure analysis data. A comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the failure mode data for further analysis. The comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> accesses the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through connection <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and selects at least one root cause of the failure corresponding to the identified failure mode which is provided on output <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Data indicative of a proposed corrective action corresponding to the identified root cause can be provided on data output <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Data for implementing the corrective action is output at <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A request for quote generator (RFQ) module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> also may be provided to forward engineering data to a consultant or seal or pump supplier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> or an external equipment seal selection program <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> such as that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/179,506, filed Oct. 27, 1998, and assigned to Northeast Equipment, Inc. and which is hereby incorporated by reference. The engineering data can be provided by an external source on input <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, or may be provided by the comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on input <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, the RFQ module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> formats and provides the engineering data in a standard format to a supplier or consultant <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, or to an equipment selection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The results and recommendations then may be provided to the comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and utilized for determining the corrective action and for planning the proper implementation plan for the corrective action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A plant performance analysis module <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is coupled to the equipment data module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the plant performance database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, the plant performance analysis module <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> utilizes the data associated with a piece of equipment stored in the equipment data module to provide quantitative data about the performance of both the equipment and the personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a more detailed block diagram of a failure analysis system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment. A customer and equipment data input/output module <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> receives data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> indicative of customer identifying data, or newly installed, modified, or repaired equipment data. The customer data is provided to the customer database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to be stored along with other information associated with the customer. Example customer data includes the name, address, phone and fax numbers, e-mail address, user identification and passwords. In one embodiment a purchase history, details of the customer&apos;s preferences, and any other data may be included. The input equipment data may be entered into the equipment data database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> for storage with other data associated with a piece of equipment. The input module also may provide query data to the equipment database to retrieve all or part of the equipment profile data stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> over connection <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The input module also provides data <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that is indicative of the equipment profiles stored within the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to a user or other external system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> receives an input <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> of equipment failure data and in one embodiment queries and receives all or part of the data stored in the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is indicative of an equipment failure mode. The seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> receives observed failure mode data via input <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, which is compared to the failure mode data stored in the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The failure mode data corresponding to the observed failure data is selected and provided on output <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the comprehensive system analyzer module <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The seal failure analysis mode <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> also may provide the failure mode data to the equipment database to be stored with data associated with the rotating equipment that has failed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The comprehensive system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> receives the failure mode data from the seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> over connection <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The comprehensive system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> collects the failure mode data, other observed failure data, and any other data associated with the failed equipment that may be stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The comprehensive system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> then synthesizes this data into a coherent data set and provides this collection of failure data to the comprehensive information analyzer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The comprehensive information analyzer module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> uses the synthesized failure data received from the comprehensive system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to determine the root cause of the failure. The data/information processor determines the cause data corresponding to the one or more failure modes determined by the seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. As will be explained below, in one embodiment, a probability weight may be assigned to the various root causes determined to aid a user in deciding upon which root cause to correct. In this way, one or more root causes may be suggested and, in one embodiment may be ranked by likelihood of occurrence. The comprehensive information analyzer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> provides this root cause data to the corrective action plan development module <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> via input <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and to the RFQ process module <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The RFQ generator module <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, as explained in more detail below, provides engineering data to a supplier, consultant or automated equipment selection system. In response, the RFQ generator module <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> can provide data on a proper selection of equipment and corrective actions via output <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>. The comprehensive information analyzer module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> also may provide data indicative of the root cause of the equipment failure to the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> via output data <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> in order to update the data profile associated with the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the comprehensive information analyzer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be coupled to an automated equipment selection system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as a seal selection system. In this embodiment, the automated equipment selection system receives the root cause data and returns specifications for equipment. The corrective action/action plan development module <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> then determines an action plan corresponding to the root cause data and provides this corrective action data via output <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. The action plan is designed to correct the root cause of the failure identified by the comprehensive information analyzer module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in one embodiment, a plant performance analyzer module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is coupled to a plant performance reliability database <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and receives input data from the plant performance reliability database <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that includes maintenance data, operations data, engineering data, and process changes to the corresponding equipment profile data stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The plant performance analyzer module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also receives data via input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that is indicative of equipment data profiles stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, the plant performance analyzer module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes data on output <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> indicative of the analyzed and quantified plant reliability data stored within the plant performance database <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> together comprise a flow chart illustrating, according to one embodiment, a process performed by the failure analysis system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Customer data is entered in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and one of three analysis options is selected in step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> represent two different modes for entering data into the equipment profile database. In step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> a user inputs new equipment profile data, or equipment profile data can be imported from another computer file such as a plant database in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are design deficiency identifying steps. In one embodiment, step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is seal design deficiency identification, step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is equipment design deficiency identification, and step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is system design deficiency identification. In each of these design deficiency identification steps, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, deficiencies in the design based on the new equipment profile data entered can be identified. The identified deficiencies can be provided to the equipment database in order to update the equipment profile data with the potential design deficiencies. In addition, the design deficiency data can be entered into the plant reliability database by using an existing equipment profile, step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, there are three options from which to choose. Step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is initiating a request for a quote, step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is accessing the seal failure analysis and updating equipment database module, and step <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> guides the user into entering information regarding a problem, failure, or leakage of a piece of equipment entered in the equipment database. If step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, a request for quote, is selected, then, in step <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, a proposal generator is initiated to provide information to an outside source, step <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, or to a seal or equipment selection system, such as described above, that is designed to recommend and purchase mechanical seals in step <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is selected, the next step <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> combines the results from data and findings collected and provides them in an organized manner to a comprehensive information analysis module, in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The comprehensive information analysis mode identifies the problems and root causes and stores problem and root cause data in a database. In one embodiment, the problem and root cause data are provided to the proposal generator as described above. The failure and root cause data are provided to the corrective action/strategy selection in step <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> that determines the required corrective action. In step <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the corrective action or actions, are implemented and the equipment database updated to ensure that all modifications and changes to equipment are entered so that the equipment database is up to date. The plant reliability performance analyzer is also updated at this point, step <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, whereupon the process ends, step <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> If step <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is selected, the user can select from two options in step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, for common mechanical equipment hydraulic problems are identified with corrective actions provided and the equipment database is updated as described below, in step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and the process ends in step <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> may also be selected from step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in which case, the human equipment systems analysis module directs the user to enter information pertinent to the failure or problem identified. As described above in step <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> through step <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, the data entered in step <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is then collected and analyzed in order to determine the cause of the problem or failure, to determine corrective action and strategy to correct the failure, and to implement those corrective actions and provide an up to date equipment database and plant reliability performance analyzer database with current data. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram of one embodiment of the system failure analyzer <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> and comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of a plant reliability system. The seal failure analysis module <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> comprises a first data gathering process <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and which receives failure mode data from the database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through input <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the first data gathering process <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is designed to select a failure mode of the system by comparing failure mode data provided by the problem/failure mode data database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with externally provided failure data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the first data gathering process <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> receives failure mode data from the problem/failure database <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and converts the failure mode data received on input <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> into a visual image. The visual image can be displayed to the user who then compares the displayed image of a failure mode with their own observations of the failure of the particular piece of equipment. The user selects, via input <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, the picture or pictures corresponding to the failure mode, or to various failure modes, observed. The visual data provided to the first data gathering process <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> may be a digitized photograph or other scanned image, or a computer generated drawing. The image may be provided to a user in many forms, such as on a computer display or in printed form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the second data gathering process <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> provides for a data output <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> to provide data to a user for guiding or instructing the user to gather failure data. The user can be instructed to obtain the desired data through direct observation and/or measurement of the failed system. The gathered data is then provided to the second data gathering process <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> via input <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The first data gathering process provides the data corresponding to the failure mode, or failure modes, selected by the user via output <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> to the system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The second data gathering process <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> provides the user obtained data to the system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> via output <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in one embodiment provides for synthesizing the data obtained from the first and second data gathering processes into a coherent format which provides not only for the determination of a root cause of the failure, but also provides a method for verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information obtained. The system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> achieves both of these results by matching the selected failure modes represented by the selected visual images with the user obtained data. Each of the individual failure modes represented by a selected visual image and the data obtained and provided by the user have corresponding predefined characteristics associated with them. As explained in more detail below, by matching the failure mode data to the user obtained data, predetermined associations between the visually identified failure modes and user obtained data can be used to determine a root cause of the problem identified by the matched data. As will be explained in more detail below, there may be some cases in which the expected association between the failure modes represented by the visual images and the user obtained data does not arise. In this case, the lack of an expected match in the input data may indicate that contradictory data was entered and that the quality of the collected data is suspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> There may be multiple intersections between the selected failure modes and the user obtained and gathered data. In these instances, there may be more than one root cause identified for the failure, and a probabilistic weighting factor may be assigned for each intersection and the corresponding root cause. For the root causes identified by the multiple intersections, probabilities for the identified causes may be combined according to the weighting factors in order to assign a particular probability to each root cause. Various methods may be used to assign probabilities to the root causes identified by the intersecting data. This data may be gathered empirically over a period of time as historical data and the probability weighting functions may be updated using this data. In another embodiment, the various probabilistic weights may be determined mathematically using functions and data based on the experience of the various users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The system analyzer <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> also is coupled to the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and provides the equipment database with the root cause or causes of the failure of the piece of equipment to ensure that the data profile of the piece of equipment that has failed stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> receives the root cause data on input <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> receives the corrective action data associated with each root cause provided by the system analyzer. The data information analysis module then provides corrective action data to a user for analysis and approval or to an automated equipment/program. The comprehensive information analysis module <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may provide the corrective action data to an automated equipment selection routine, such as the seal selection system described above that provides automated seal selection based on provided engineering data. The data information analysis module may provide corrective action and engineering data to the proposal generator to generate a request for quote report. Such a report may be provided to either an automated equipment selection processor, such as the seal selection system described above, or to corporations, consultants, manufacturers, or other third parties that may provide further analysis of the data. In one embodiment, the seal selection system responds with a particular seal selection. The seal selection system then may provide manufacturing data directly to a design center of the manufacturer and in one embodiment, download the data for manufacturing the particular seal. The offline activities of either the seal selection system or the consultants, manufacturers, or corporations may provide their own analysis of the data to provide engineering data to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The user may select the desired corrective action, whether the data is generated by a local or remote seal selection system, a consultant, or other users. This corrective action data is provided to the corrective action implementation and repair processor <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, as well as the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> in order to update the equipment profiles with the selected repairs or modifications. As will be described in more detail below, the corrective action, implementation and repair process <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> in one embodiment, can provide information for the installation, repair, setup, safety procedures to be used, and training packages to effectuate the desired corrective action. The corrective action implementation and repair process <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> provides the installation and setup instructions to the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> in order to update the equipment profile of the failed piece of equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>represent, in one embodiment, an example of the visual images used to identify a failure mode of the seal. These images shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>include photographs taken of actual seals and components that have failed, and drawings of seals and components representative of actual parts that have failed. A user is instructed using either on-screen photographs or printed sheets containing the photographs, to observe the seal and provide an indication in a condition identify box in every instance in which the user observes a corresponding symptom in the failed seal or pump. Identifying an existing condition in the seal or pump by selecting a photograph or drawing can identify a failure mode of the pump or seal. There are other visual images corresponding to other failure modes than the example representations shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thus, the plant reliability program is not limited to these example visual images. Other types of computer generated visual information could be used to identify the failure modes of a seal or pump. Example forms of the visual information include computer generated engineering drawings, computer generated three dimensional images, computer animation, or any other computer readable visual image, including photographs and digitally captured still images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>provide an example of the type and format of the instructions provided to a user for gathering data by observing or measuring the rotating equipment. In one embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the equipment profile as originally designed is provided to a user. The user is then instructed to observe any changes in the current configuration from the original or previous configuration of the rotating equipment and to note them. This data can be used to verify the past work that has been performed on the rotating equipment as well as provide an opportunity to update the equipment profile database and predict any possible weaknesses or failures that may occur. The user also may be asked to determine if the change is related to the failure and if so to explain how. In one embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, the user is guided through identifying the seal type, and is instructed which information to provide. For example, in one embodiment, the user could be asked to identify the seal type, where the leakage occurred and how much leakage first occurred, and the operating conditions under which the leakage occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The questions generally have two parts. The first question is asked and, depending on a yes or no answer, other information is then requested. Under some conditions this additionally requested information then triggers a third or fourth question in order to adequately identify further data about a configuration of failure and in some case the responsible party of that piece of equipment. The plant reliability program is not limited merely to the questions provided in the example figures. The data to be gathered, the form of the questions to be asked, and the follow-up questions may come in many forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>illustrate one embodiment of the synthesizing of the data obtained by the second data gathering process, the failure mode data, and other analyzed data. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, the data obtained by the second data gathering process can be subdivided and stored in a plurality of subsections. The data entered into different subsections may be defined by different groups of personnel or different departments within the plant, to allow a plant reliability manager to verify the quality of the data gathered. By scientifically analyzing the collected data and cross referencing the collected data to the failure modes identified by the system, erroneous data collected by one group of personnel or one department can be identified with data collected by a different group of personnel or department. This control of the input reduces the likelihood of erroneous data that is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the description that follows the organization and grouping of the data to be collected is but one embodiment, and is to be considered only an example. The data to be collected could be grouped in many different ways, and also that entire other sets of data could be selected. The initial problem identification section <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is used to gather data that occurs shortly after a problem, such as a seal failure, occurs. For example, data to be analyzed can include identifying the mechanical seal leakage, the time frame of initial leakage of a mechanical seal, the initial mechanical seal leakage pattern, and mechanical seal temperature information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Mechanical problems are identified in section <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, hydraulic problems are identified in section <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, packing problems are identified in <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>, and equipment leakage problems are identified in section <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. As an example of the separation of the data collection process in section <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> hydraulic problems are identified by the maintenance department, the engineering department, and the operations department. As pointed out above by having separate departments collecting overlapping data the accuracy and completeness of the data may be determined. Other sections in which data collected include the operating conditions <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>, process fluid analysis <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>, mechanical seal analysis <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the plant performance and reliability apparatus, the system analyzer module <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> utilizes a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>to synthesize the collected data with the failure mode data and any design deficiency data, if provided. The numbers <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight> listed across the top of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>each represent a single graphical/visual image corresponding to a failure mode of the equipment. The system analyzer module <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> synthesizes all of the collected data within this spreadsheet like format. As described above, the human, equipment, system analysis corresponding to the second data gathering process <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> directs the user to collect certain data from various parts of the rotating equipment and system using questions, examples of which are provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 </cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The user collects data from various subsystems identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>. In addition, any data from the design deficiency modules <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> also are provided and automatically entered into this form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The form shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>is arranged so that each intersection between the failure mode data and the user data gathered, located along the left side of the sheet, is associated with data indicative of a possible root cause of a failure. As the data is automatically entered into the form the matches between the failure mode data and the data gathered by the user or derived from other analysis modules are noted. These matches represent candidate root causes of the equipment failure. The candidate root causes of the failure, in one embodiment, as described above can be provided with a probability weighting factor so that a user will be able to judge the most likely cause based on the data. In one embodiment, the probability assigned to a candidate root cause may be determined empirically from historical failure data. In this embodiment these probabilities may be updated as new failure data is obtained. In another embodiment, the probability may be derived mathematically from known formulas and using standard techniques. The root cause data may be provided to the user in any format. The association of the root cause data with the intersections between the failure mode data and the user obtained and derived data can be determined from many sources including industry provided information. For example the John Crane Company publishes information on seal failure analysis in a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Identifying causes of seal leakage&rdquo; and incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, a four part series entitled &ldquo;A user&apos;s guide to mechanical seal failure analysis&rdquo;, parts I-IV was published in the journal <highlight><italic>Face to Face</italic></highlight>, Vol. IV No. 2-4 and Vol. V, No. I also incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Both matches and situations in which a match would be expected to occur may provide valuable information. In one embodiment, as the root cause data is determined a cross reference can be performed to determine if data is missing or was entered erroneously. In this embodiment, the plant reliability manager would be able to identify data that would be expected to be observed for a given root cause of a failure, but has not been entered. This disconnect between expected and actual data may be due to several problems relating to personnel, such as a lack of training. As noted above, the user collected data is obtained by separate personnel, organizations or departments within the plant thus, providing for the independent collection of overlapping data. Thus, the cross referencing of root cause failure data with the observed collected failure mode data, permits deficiencies in training or other personnel problems to be identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>provide, in one embodiment, an example of the installation instructions, engineering drawings, setup and safety information that can be provided by the plant reliability system. In the example figures provided, the information provides detailed installation and setup instructions, and also may provide additional information such as piping plans, supply tank connection information, and safety and training information to properly install the equipment. The number and complexity of the instructions vary with the types of equipment, the uses of the equipment, and the level of mechanical complexity of the equipment. Thus, the plant reliability system should not be construed to be limited to the example instructions provided in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the plant performance analysis package associated with the plant reliability program. The plant performance operation <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes plant performance module <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and to the plant performance database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The plant reliability database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives equipment profile data from the equipment database <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Using the historical failure data associated with the piece of equipment, plant performance data may be calculated and stored in the plant performance database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The plant performance analyzer may calculate the mean time between failures, the maintenance, repair and operation data for a piece of equipment, the life cycle costs associated with the piece of equipment, cost associated with equipment downtime, or measures of equipment performance and the performance of the maintenance, operations, engineering and purchasing departments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The data may be stored in any manner which permits the associations among the data to be maintained and retrieved and searched. For example, the data may be stored in a database, such as a relational database, object-oriented database, unstructured database or other database. A database may be constructed using a flat file system, for example by using files with character-delimited fields, such as in FileMaker Pro and in early versions of dBASE, now known as Visual dBASE from Inprise Corp. of Scotts Valley, Calif. formerly Borland International Corp. Example relational databases include Oracle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>from Oracle Corporation of Redwood City, Calif., Informix Dynamic Server from Informix Software. Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., DB2 from International Business Machines of Yorktown Heights, N.Y. and Access from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. An example object-oriented database is ObjectStore from Object Design of Burlington, Mass. An example unstructured database is Notes from the Lotus Corporation, of Cambridge, Mass. Data also may be stored in standard data files according to a data structure defined in a computer program, such as an array, a list, a tree, a linked list, or other structure permitting data association. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the proposal, or RFQ, generator process <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>. The proposal, or request for quote (RFQ), generator module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> receives input data from either an external source supplied by the user on input <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, or the root cause data and corrective action data may be obtained from the data information analyzer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via input <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In the case of a user input on input <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the data could be supplied from the user directly or from an external database supplied with the information corresponding to the piece or pieces of equipment that have failed. The RFQ generator module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> receives the input data from either source, formats the data into a standard form template and provides this data to either an automated equipment selection system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> such as the seal selection program described above, or to an outside supplier or consultant <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The format of the data that is provided to the software equipment selection programs is defined by the input data specifications of those programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The data returned to RFQ generator process <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> by the automated equipment selection program such as a seal selection program may be supplied either to the user or to the data analysis module <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. When supplied to the data analysis module <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the recommended equipment could then be electronically ordered from the manufacturer. In another embodiment, the user could approve of the equipment selection and proceed to order the equipment either electronically or by more traditional methods from the manufacturer. As described in the patent application, Apparatus and Method for Selecting a Mechanical Seal filed on Oct. 27, 1998, by Northeast Equipment, Inc., Ser. No. 09/179,506, the seal selection module could provide either a standard or a custom seal designed to specifications, and upon approval, automatically generate the instructions for the manufacturing plant to make and test the desired seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> If a consultant or other manufacturing entity is used, analysis and recommendations from them can be received, evaluated by the user, and a decision made as to the implementation of those recommendations. This data may be provided to the equipment database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to update the data stored in the equipment database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> associated with a piece of equipment about to be repaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the plant performance database associates data with a particular piece of equipment <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. The above-described downtime analysis. MRO analysis <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>, and MTBF <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight>, and LCC costs <highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight> are calculated using standard methods and are stored for each piece of equipment, along with any changes in the process fluid <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, and the tracking of failure data and performed work data for each department and/or individual within each department responsible for carrying out analysis and repairs on a particular piece of equipment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> in one embodiment, there can also be included maintenance department data <highlight><bold>1612</bold></highlight>, operations department data <highlight><bold>1614</bold></highlight>, engineering department data <highlight><bold>1616</bold></highlight>, contractor data <highlight><bold>1618</bold></highlight>, and purchasing department data <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. By tracking the data associated with each of these departments, the effectiveness and quality of the work, and the quality of the management of each department may be determined so that any corrective action may be taken. As an example, data associated with the purchasing department can be analyzed to show that a vendor may have been supplying low-quality parts that have contributed to equipment failures over time. Similarly, the effectiveness of the actions undertaken by various departments, such as the maintenance, operations, and engineering departments, may be tracked over time as well, and a similar metric may be defined in order to ascertain the quality of the services provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, this data is available to the plant reliability manager. In one embodiment, the plant reliability manager has an additional screen listing tasks that are recommended by the system to be performed and allowing the reliability manager to determine whether to perform the task. In one embodiment the system can recommend the department to be assigned to perform the task, the sequence of events that is to occur, and allows the plant reliability manager to assign a person or persons within the department to perform the task. In one embodiment, the choice of whether management approval is required after the task is completed is provided. In one embodiment, the system has preassigned a department and sequence for each task to be performed, although the reliability manager has the ability to use system defaults or to change any and all of the entries. Thus, information can be changed and maintained by the plant reliability manager. The departments and the personnel involved thus have their performance checked and verified automatically. Thus, historical failure data collected over time will be able to show weaknesses in the plant operation and deficiencies in training or other personnel problems that may be corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a potential deployment <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> of the product reliability system. The plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> forms the center of an operation with interconnections between the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> and various users and vendors. The plant reliability system could be used, for example, by consultants <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight>. The consultants could either buy the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>&mdash;a one way transaction, with one transaction cost <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight>; or pay a fee and access the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> over a network <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>&mdash;a two way transaction with multiple transaction costs. In the case of accessing the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> over a network, the Internet, a LAN, dial-up line, or other remote access method could be used. The consultant may gather the necessary data, access the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, provide the necessary data and receive the results of the analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a user plant could either purchase the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, with the one way transaction cost <highlight><bold>1808</bold></highlight>. In this case, the user plant would use the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> to analyze its failures and then could use the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> to generate RFQ documents electronically to a supplier (not shown). The supplier, for example, could utilize an automated equipment selection system which could generate a price quote and the entire transaction could be completed electronically. Alternatively, the user plant could access the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> remotely, and potentially pay for each transaction. The plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> could be owned by an equipment supplier. The user plant would supply failure data, and the results of the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> could include a proposal indicating which of the seal or pump equipment supplier&apos;s particular products could fulfill the specifications, thus completing the transaction electronically. In a further development, manufacturing data for the products could be generated and provided to the equipment supplier for a fast and efficient manufacturing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a user plant may retain a consultant who interacts with the equipment supplier on behalf of the manufacturing plant, and who utilizes the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> either locally or remotely in conduction with an equipment supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The diverse methods of generating profit using the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> can be seen in the web that is formed between consultants, user plants, equipment suppliers, and resalers. Each transaction could be a single transaction for a sale of the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>. In addition, the transaction could be one of a multiple number of transactions where many different customers may access the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>. In this case, for example where the plant reliability system <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> is operated by a seal or pump equipment supplier, the advantage would be that customers accessing the system would be more likely to purchase a piece of equipment from that supplier. In the case of a user plant. RFQ&apos;s may be generated for multiple suppliers for comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a method for performing the input process <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> functions of the failure analysis system. In particular, in step <highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight> new/changed equipment data is provided. The data may be either data for new equipment that is being added to the system, or data that represents a modification to a piece of equipment already in use and entered by a user. In step <highlight><bold>1904</bold></highlight> the problem/failure database is accessed and problem/failure data is retrieved corresponding to the type of equipment. In one embodiment for example, if a new seal data was being entered, only problem/failure data relating to the particular type of seal would be retrieved. In step <highlight><bold>1906</bold></highlight> the new/changed equipment data is compared to the retrieved problem/failure data. In step <highlight><bold>1908</bold></highlight>, a positive comparison is one in which the new/changed equipment data corresponds to a problem/failure data indicating that a potential problem exists. In step <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> the data indicating that a potential problem exists is stored in the equipment database and is associated with new/changed equipment data. In this way, the equipment database is updated and a more accurate failure analysis is achieved. </paragraph>

In step <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, the user is provided with failure mode data corresponding to a particular piece of equipment. The failure mode data could be visual images of failure modes of the corresponding rotating equipment. The user then selects the failure mode data corresponding to the actual failure of the rotating equipment. The user may select one or more visual images representing multiple failure modes of a piece of rotating equipment. In step <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight>, the user is directed to gather data from about the failed piece of rotating equipment. This data could be observations of condition of the equipment, readings from telemetry instrumentation collecting data from the piece of rotating equipment. In step <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight>, the user provides this data to the system. The user could enter the data from a keyboard or other input device such as a voice recognition system, or OCR system. In step <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> the failure mode data and the user gathered data are matched together. In one embodiment, the data is entered into a form that automatically forms the matches between the failure mode data and the data gathered by the user or derived from other analysis modules. In step <highlight><bold>2012</bold></highlight> an association between these matches represent candidate root causes of the equipment failure. In step <highlight><bold>2014</bold></highlight> a probability weighting factor is assigned to the candidate root causes of the equipment failure. In one embodiment, the probability assigned to a candidate root cause may be determined empirically from historical failure data. In this embodiment these probabilities may be updated as new failure data is obtained. In another embodiment, the probability may be derived mathematically from known formulas and using standard techniques. In step <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>, a root cause from among the candidate root causes is selected. The selection process may involve the user evaluating the data and probabilistic weight attached to each of the candidate root causes and manually selecting a root cause. In another embodiment, the system itself may select the root cause based upon the analysis of the data. In step <highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight> the selected root cause is analyzed to determine a proper corrective action to resolve the root cause problem. In step <highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight>, the data associated with the failed piece of rotating equipment is updated to include the selected failure mode, the selected root cause of the failure mode, and corrective action selected to resolve the root cause of the failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a method for practicing a request for quote generation function of the failure analysis system. In step <highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight>, engineering data is provided the RFQ system for a piece of rotating equipment. The engineering data may be provided by the user, by another part of the failure analysis system, or an external source of data such as a equipment selection system. In step <highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight> a template is selected based upon the type of equipment and the intended recipient. For example a manufacturer or supplier of one type of equipment may have different data requirements than a supplier of another type of equipment or a consultant. Thus, different templates may be required to ensure that the intended recipient receives their required data. In step <highlight><bold>2106</bold></highlight> the data is inserted into the template and a report is formed. In step <highlight><bold>2108</bold></highlight> the report is transmitted to the receiving party. The transmission may be, but is not limited to, electronically transmitting the report over a network such as the Internet or a LAN. In another embodiment, the report may mailed, faxed or otherwise physically delivered to the recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>together form an illustration of one embodiment for practicing a plant reliability function of the system failure analysis system. In step <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>, the process begins with the identification of a responsible party for undertaking a corrective action for a failed piece of equipment. The responsible party may be a particular department or organization, or an individual assigned to the task. In step <highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight>, data indicative of the responsible party is then stored and is associated with the data indicative of the corrective action and data indicative of the failed piece of equipment. In step <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight> in later failures of the same equipment, a determination is made from the data analysis if the failed piece of equipment failed with the same failure mode as the previous failure. The responsible party may be determined to have contributed to the subsequent failure by the analysis of the failure data as detailed above. For example, as explained above, there may be direct evidence of the failure data, or as explained above, the absence of expected data may be used to infer the repeated failure of the responsible party in carrying out the corrective action. The repeated failure of the responsible party may indicate a weakness in the level of training of the responsible party, or a lack of ability on the part of the responsible party. In step <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight>, later failures of the same piece equipment may indicate that the corrective action was not efficacious in correcting the root cause of the equipment failure. Because there may be multiple candidate root causes for each failure, the selected root cause may not be the correct one. If a piece of equipment fails repeatedly in the same manner, and the work has been performed to appropriate standards, then a different collective action may be indicated. In step <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight> the data associated with the responsible party is stored for each failure and is associated with the corrective action undertaken and the failed piece of equipment. In step <highlight><bold>2212</bold></highlight> the data associated with the corrective action undertaken is stored for each failure and is associated with the failed piece of equipment. In step <highlight><bold>2214</bold></highlight> a mean time between failure (MTBF) is calculated, in step <highlight><bold>2216</bold></highlight>, using the cost associated with analyzing and resolving the failure of the piece of equipment, the life cycle costs (LCC) is calculated, and the cost of the particular failure is determined as well. It should be understood that these three reliability data are not the only reliability data that can be calculated. Many other forms of reliability data may be calculated and may be needed depending on the circumstances of the rotating equipment, the process fluids, the system design, operating condition, and other circumstances particular to individual industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This system may be developed using a number of computer programming tools, including general purpose programming languages and database programs. In one embodiment, the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is implemented using script files developed using a File Maker Pro software application running on a Windows95 operating system. The databases are implemented using database script files and the operations of the various modules also are implemented as scripts for accessing those data files. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to a particular computer programming language or database programming system, or operating system. It also should be understood that the databases may be defined as a single data file, as a spreadsheet file, as a database script, or may be generated by more than one computer file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Rotating equipment failure analysis software, including computer programs which implement aspects of the system, may be stored on some type of removable computer-readable storage media such as a CD-ROM, tape, or diskette. The software may be copied to a permanent form of storage media on the computer system (e.g. a hard disk) to preserve the removable storage media for back-up purposes. When the seal selection software is in use, the software is generally at least in part stored in RAM within memory, and is executed on the processor. When running the modeling software on the computer system, a user typically gives commands and enters data via the input device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Having now described an embodiment of the invention, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example only. Numerous modifications and other embodiments are within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art. It should be understood that the foregoing is merely an example of a system for analyzing failures occurring in rotating equipment. The present invention also may be used to provide for the analysis of the failures of bearings, o-rings, couplings, pump parts, labyrinth seals and lip seals. It also should be understood that, although the invention has been described in the context of a predetermined set of possible failure modes, that the system may be expanded to include failure modes for auxiliary products that may be developed. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to any particular set of seals, pumps, equipment, or other parts related to such systems. These and other modifications are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention.</paragraph>
