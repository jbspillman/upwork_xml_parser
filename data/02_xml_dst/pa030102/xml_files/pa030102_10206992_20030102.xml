<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to watercraft and more particularly to flexible seating configurations in a watercraft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various types of watercraft exist, each being suited for different types of activities. For example, one type of boat, the pontoon-type watercraft, is usually equipped with an outboard motor, typically operates at slower speeds, and generally offers a more relaxed ride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, chairs and tables are arranged on the deck of the pontoon-type watercraft for cruising and for accommodating a variety of other aquatic activities in space and comfort. Since most, if not all, of the chairs located on the deck of a pontoon boat are not physically attached to the boat, the chairs can be arranged in many different configurations, providing for a high level of flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Other types of watercraft, such as sport boats, are designed for higher speeds and sportier handling. In contrast to pontoon boats, sport boats typically are designed with specific deck configurations where the seats are fixedly positioned to provide a safe and comfortable ride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a conventional sport boat, the seats are fixed such that riders cannot choose a seating configuration. While the boat is moving, particularly at higher speeds, it is desirable for riders to face forward. Therefore, in a conventional sport boat, the seats are typically fixed such that riders will necessarily face forward at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, once the boat is anchored, it is often more desirable for the riders to face one another, so that it is easier to engage in conversation. Also, it is desirable for the riders to be able to move about the boat with greater ease. This is often hindered by the design of conventional sport boats where the seats are often fixed in a forward-only position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While pontoon-type boats and sport boats do not define the entire universe of possible options, a significant gap exists between these two types of watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need has developed for a watercraft that can provide greater flexibility in seating configurations for riders on deck (like the pontoon boat), while also being capable of accommodating riders at greater speeds (like the sport boat). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a watercraft with a powered hull and a flexible seating configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention provides at least one seat configured for accommodating at least one rider that is selectively switchable between a driving position and at least one relaxing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a pair of passenger seats that are selectively switchable between a driving position and at least one relaxing position. When the pair of seats are in the driving position, the seats are substantially contiguous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a rear passenger bench such that when the pair of seats are in a relaxing position, they form a substantially contiguous seating module with the passenger bench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention provides a powered hull, at least one seat for accommodating a single rider, and a rear passenger bench, such that when the single passenger seat is in a relaxing position, it forms a substantially contiguous seating module with the passenger bench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention provides a powered hull, a pair of seats for accommodating one rider each, and a rear passenger bench, such that when the pair of passenger seats are in a relaxing position, they form a substantially contiguous seating module with the passenger bench.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Throughout the description of the several embodiments of the present invention, reference will be made to various elements, the construction of which is readily known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, an exhaustive description of each and every component is not provided, only a description of those elements required for an understanding of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a top view of a watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention. In the preferred embodiment, the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a jet boat that includes a powered hull <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The watercraft illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sport boat. The details of the sport boat have been omitted because they are not relevant to the present invention. As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate after reading the description set forth below, the present invention may be employed on any watercraft, regardless of style, size or propulsion type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> depicted in the figures, the hull <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a bow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a stern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. An engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is disposed at the stem <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to a propulsion unit (not shown) that provides the motive force for the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the engine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is either a two or four stroke internal combustion engine. However, other engine types may be used without deviating from the scope of the present invention. In addition, the propulsion unit preferably is a jet pump arranged at the stern <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, alternative propulsion units, such as a propeller, may be substituted therefor without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Generally, the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> depicted includes a forward passenger area <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a rearward passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The forward passenger area <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed in the bow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is provided with a seating arrangement <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which, in the case of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> illustrated, includes two forwardly-facing seats, disposed side by side. The seating arrangement in the rear passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The forward passenger area <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is separated from the rearward passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by a windshield <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that extends from the port side P to the starboard side S of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To permit riders to move about the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the forward passenger area <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the rearward passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a passageway <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided between the two areas <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A hinged window section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is disposed in the passageway <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The window section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown in the closed position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The closed position is preferred when the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is underway because the window section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> completes the wind screen provided by windshield <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. When the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is anchored, the window section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be opened to permit riders to move freely between the forward passenger area <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the rearward passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (through passageway <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the rearward passenger area <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention has at least one seat configured for accommodating at least one rider. In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> pair of seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided in the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, both of the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown in the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sized to accommodate both an average, adult-sized driver and an average, adult-sized rider. Similarly, the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sized to accommodate two average, adult-sized riders. Since each seat may accommodate at least two persons, the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are referred to as &ldquo;buddy seats.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, throughout this description, references made to the &ldquo;passenger&apos;s seat&rdquo; and the &ldquo;driver&apos;s seat&rdquo; are for purposes of distinguishing the locations of the two seats from one another. The appellation &ldquo;passenger&apos;s seat&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver&apos;s seat&rdquo; should not be taken to mean that the driver&apos;s seat cannot accommodate a passenger or rider or that the passenger&apos;s seat cannot accommodate a driver. To the contrary, passengers and drivers are all considered riders of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may be seated in any of the locations suitable for a rider, regardless of his or her designation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be sized to accommodate a single adult driver and the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be sized to accommodate a single adult rider. One skilled in the art would recognize that any combination of these seats may be possible, i.e., the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be sized for a single adult driver and the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be a &ldquo;buddy seat&rdquo; or vice-versa. Two of these alternate arrangements are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a variation of the seating arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, however, is configured to accommodate only one individual rather than two. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a variation of the seating arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Here, the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is configured to accommodate more than one adult person. To accommodate the longer seat <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> when pivoted into the relaxed position (as described in greater detail below), the front edge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the bench seat <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the starboard side of the boat is shortened by comparison with the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are both &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; and form a substantially contiguous seating area while in the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the inside edges of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are within about 3 inches from one another when the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Most preferably, the inside edge of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the inside edge of the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are within about one inch from one another when the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the closeness of the inside edge of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the inside edge of the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not required to practice the present invention. In a boat wider than the one illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is possible, perhaps even likely, that the two seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be separated from one another by a distance greater than 3 inches. Such a separation is considered to be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in instances where the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are designed to accommodate only one adult-sized rider, it is contemplated that the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be separated from one another by a distance greater than 3 inches. Two such exemplary configurations are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on a swivel mount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which permits the driver&apos;s seat to rotate about the axis of the swivel mount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The swivel mount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is attached to a pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is used to lock the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the desired position. The pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is mounted to the floor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted to the floor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the same way (not shown) to permit the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to swivel about the swivel mount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When in the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> orients the driver of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a forward-facing position (toward the bow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), which is a proper position for driving, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. To change the position of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be released and the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be rotated to a relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and locked in place, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be of any construction suitable for permitting the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pivot from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and from the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In addition, the pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may also be equipped with a slide mechanism beneath the seat&apos;s bottom portion (not shown) so that the driver may move the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forwardly or rearwardly (with respect to the swivel mount <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) to accommodate his or her height and comfort requirements (among other requirements). Alternatively, the pedestal stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be positioned in the center of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without a slide mechanism to permit rotation. One skilled in the art would understand that the passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be configured as a mirror image of the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be rotated from about 0&deg; to about 180&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated from about 90&deg; to about 180&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Most preferably, the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated about 90&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that they can be retracted against the side gunwales of the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, disposed rearwardly from the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Preferably, when the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated about 90&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> create a substantially contiguous seating module, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Preferably, the gap between the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is less than about 3 inches when the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; are in the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Most preferably, the gap between the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is less than about 1 inch when the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; are in the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In an alternate arrangement, which is contemplated for a longer watercraft than the one illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, leg room could be provided between the buddy seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when the buddy seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been rotated to the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be rotated about 90&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the relaxed position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> do not form a substantially contiguous seating module as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Instead, there may exist a gap (not shown) between the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; and the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This is likely if the watercraft <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is longer than the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This is also likely if one of the seats has a single-passenger configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In still another alternative embodiment, the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be rotated about 180&deg; from the driving position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to an alternative relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; so that they face the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. To permit the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to rotate 180&deg;, the seats may have to be placed in a boat wider (and perhaps longer) than the one illustrated. Alternatively, the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be provided with a support that permits both rotation and sliding (sideways movement) to facilitate rotation of the seats <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a fill 180&deg;, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be of any design known to one skilled in the art. The bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be, but is not limited to, a substantially straight design, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, or a curved design, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. One skilled in the art would understand that the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be designed such that the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will form a substantially contiguous seat module once the &ldquo;buddy seats&rdquo; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. One skilled in the art would also understand that if the driver&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and passenger&apos;s seat <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are designed to accommodate only one person each, the rear passenger bench <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be designed such that a substantially contiguous seating module is formed, once the seats <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are in the relaxing position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the invention may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
