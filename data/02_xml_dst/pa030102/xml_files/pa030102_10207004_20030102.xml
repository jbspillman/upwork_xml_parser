<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to watercraft and more particularly to watercraft with improved stability. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various types of watercraft exist, each being suited for different types of activities. For example, a pontoon-type watercraft is designed for slower speeds and general recreational use and is typically powered by an outboard engine. In contrast, sport boats and personal watercraft are designed for higher speeds and superior handling and are powered typically by inboard jet drive systems, which consist of an inboard engine and a jet propulsion unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a conventional sport boat, the engine is mounted above a jet propulsion unit. The intake for the jet propulsion unit is located beneath the watercraft and the exhaust, or jet port, is located at the rear of the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are several parameters that are engineered into a sport boat that may affect its performance. One of those parameters is the &ldquo;drive line angle,&rdquo; which is the angle measured between the primary drive shaft (attached to the impeller) and the keel line of the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to the physical characteristics of conventional jet drive systems in sport boats in the prior art, the drive line angle is typically about 4 degrees or greater. In a conventional watercraft, the positive angle of the drive line translates into an angle of thrust that is directed slightly upward toward the surface of the water, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The upward thrust angle has a tendency to push the bow of the watercraft out of the water. In other words, the positive drive line angle tends to lift the bow of the sport boat during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,740 (the &apos;740 patent) describes and illustrates a personal watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which incorporates a jet propulsion drive configured according to the teachings of the prior art. As illustrated in FIG. 3 of the &apos;740 patent, the impeller shaft 56 is angled upwardly from the keel line. The exact angle &agr; of the impeller shaft 56, however, is not disclosed. The &apos;740 patent only discusses the advantages of a positive angle &agr; for operation of the personal watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described. (See. e.g.. the &apos;740 patent at col. 5, lines 36-48.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While those skilled in art may appreciate the benefits of a positive drive angle, a phenomenon known as &ldquo;porpoising&rdquo; may be detected, at certain speeds, by occupants of certain boats. &ldquo;Porpoising&rdquo; refers to a condition where the boat tends to move up and down in the water like the movement of a porpoise when it jumps out of the water. This can create an unpleasant ride for the occupants of the boat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, sport boats powered by jet propulsion units have all had positive drive line angles. In fact, conventional wisdom suggests that anything less than a positive drive line angle will so adversely affect vehicle performance that manufacturers of marine engines have specifically discouraged the incorporation of neutral (0&deg;) or negative drive line angles in boats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Porpoising,&rdquo; however, remains a problem with certain boat designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists for a watercraft that utilizes a jet drive system with improved stability and reduced &ldquo;porpoising&rdquo; to ensure that the occupants of the boat will experience a more comfortable and enjoyable ride. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a watercraft, which provides the advantages of a jet propulsion system, with increased stability and reduced &ldquo;porpoising,&rdquo; by controlling the angle of thrust of the propulsion unit relative to the keel line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention provides a watercraft including a hull with a keel and a jet drive power source. The jet drive power source includes an engine, an engine output shaft, and a jet propulsion unit. The jet propulsion unit includes a water passage, a drive shaft, an impeller, and a jet port. The engine output shaft is operationally connected to the drive shaft. The jet drive power source is configured to produce power along a predetermined direction and form a drive line based upon the predetermined direction. The drive line bisects a plane of the keel at a predetermined, preferably negative, angle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Throughout the description of the several embodiments of the present invention, reference will be made to various elements, the construction of which is readily known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, an exhaustive description of each and every component is not provided, only a description of those elements required for an understanding of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side view of a watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. In the preferred embodiment, the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a jet boat that includes a hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with a bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a stern <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The watercraft illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sport boat. The details of the sport boat have been omitted because they are not relevant to the present invention. As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate after reading the description set forth below, the present invention may be employed on any style jet-propelled boat, regardless of the size, style, or configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is powered by a jet drive power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The jet drive power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides for an improved boat ride by comparison with a conventional, propeller-driven watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in general detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the jet drive power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an engine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with an output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The engine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be, but is not limited to, a two-stroke or a four-stroke, inboard, internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with a water passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defined by the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, an intake <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, an impeller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Although the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be a separate piece that is mounted to the hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is preferably integrally formed as part of the hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through its output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is rotationally connected to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, located within the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such that the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are not substantially parallel. That is, an angle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed between the longitudinal axis of the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> such that the angle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is greater than zero. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> could be disposed so that they are substantially parallel (either coaxial or coplanar) to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As defined herein, in the preferred embodiment, the angle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed between the longitudinal axis of the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will, by definition, be between about 5 degrees to about 175 degrees, no matter the configuration between the engine <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the angle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be between about 45 degrees to about 135 degrees. Most preferably, the angle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be about 90 degrees and the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> will have a generally vertical orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments illustrated, the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are located in the same longitudinal plane that bisects the hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the stem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the output shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be located in a plane that is either parallel to, or intersects with the longitudinal plane that bisects the hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the stem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Disposed within the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a water passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. During normal operation of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, water enters the passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at an intake <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located at the bottom of the hull <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The water enters the passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, passes by an impeller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and exits the passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through a nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and then through a jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Depending on the speed of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may or may not operate below the waterline <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Normally, at slow speeds, the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> usually operates beneath the waterline <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> typically is a steerable nozzle connected, usually via cables, to the helm of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As the operator changes the helm direction, so, too; does he/she change the direction of jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the operator changes the travel direction of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for the jet drive power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generate a force along the drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in a rearward direction <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> forms an angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> with the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a plane <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> defined by the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is shown at the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as a solid line and above the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (for reference) as a dotted line. The plane <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is laterally oriented, parallel to the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the central axes of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the impeller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are aligned along a common centerline. So aligned, the centerline, which is an extension of the central axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, defines the drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are substantially oriented along the same direction. In other words, both are oriented to direct the force of the jet power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> along the drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. It is possible, however, that the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be oriented with respect to one another so that they are not substantially oriented along the same direction. Regardless, the combined effect of the nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the jet port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will establish a drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> with an angular orientation to the plane <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> defined by the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. That drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> typically corresponds to the axis of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> intersects with the plane <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at an angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. In the conventional embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the drive line <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> forms a positive angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of more than about 4 degrees with the plane <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the keel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, prior to the present invention, those skilled in the art (in particular the jet drive engine manufacturers) believed that the drive line angle must be positive in order for the watercraft to operate properly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Anything less than about a 4 degree drive line angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> was strongly discouraged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In certain watercraft designs, however, the positive drive line angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of 4 degrees may create the &ldquo;porpoising&rdquo; effect. This problem is acknowledged in the &apos;740 patent, which is discussed above. The reason for this is believed to be as follows. The positive drive line angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> has a tendency to push the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> up out of the water. When the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reaches a sufficient speed, enough of the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> extends above the water that the water cannot support the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In other words, the weight of the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> exceeds the upward buoyant force of the water. This causes the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to fall into the water until the flow of the water pushes the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> up again to the point where it no longer is in equilibrium with the buoyant force of the water. The repetitive rise and fall of the bow <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> results in &ldquo;porpoising.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To address the problem of &ldquo;porpoising,&rdquo; the inventors decided to contravene conventional knowledge and decrease the drive line angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to less than the traditionally-required 4 degrees. After reducing the drive line angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to less than 4 degrees, the inventors discovered that &ldquo;porpoising&rdquo; can be reduced significantly or eliminated altogether without affecting the performance of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This creates a more stable, less bumpy, boat ride. The present invention is intended to encompass watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of less than <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> degrees. Preferably, the predetermined angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is about &minus;5 degrees to about 2 degrees. More preferably, the predetermined angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is about &minus;3 degrees to about 1 degree. Most preferably, the predetermined angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is about &minus;2 degrees to about 0 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition, one skilled in the art would understand that the predetermined angle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> can be altered in a number of different ways without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> differs from the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in that the power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed above the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In particular, the jet drive power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned above the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> such that a substantial portion of the power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends over the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> toward the rear of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned in front of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In that embodiment, a substantial portion of the power source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends forwardly of the end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (toward the front of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> permits a more compact construction for the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> than the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be employed in a watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where space is more of a concern than the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> From the invention just described, it will be obvious that the invention may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
