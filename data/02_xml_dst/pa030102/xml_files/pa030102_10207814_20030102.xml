<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel cytotoxic agents and their therapeutic use. More specifically, the invention relates to novel cytotoxic agents comprising taxanes and their therapeutic use. These novel cytotoxic agents have therapeutic use as a result of delivering the taxanes to a specific cell population in a targeted fashion by chemically linking the taxane to a cell binding agent. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many reports have appeared on the attempted specific targeting of tumor cells with monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates (Sela et al, in <highlight><italic>Immunoconjugates </italic></highlight>189-216 (C. Vogel, ed. 1987); Ghose et al, in <highlight><italic>Targeted Drugs </italic></highlight>1-22 (E. Goldberg, ed. 1983); Diener et al, in <highlight><italic>Antibody mediated delivery systems </italic></highlight>1-23 (J. Rodwell, ed. 1988); Pietersz et al, in <highlight><italic>Antibody mediated delivery systems </italic></highlight>25-53 (J. Rodwell, ed. 1988); Bumol et al, in <highlight><italic>Antibody mediated delivery systems </italic></highlight>55-79 (J. Rodwell, ed. 1988). All references and patents cited herein are incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, melphalan, mitomycin C, and chlorambucil have been conjugated to a variety of murine monoclonal antibodies. In some cases, the drug molecules were linked to the antibody molecules through an intermediary carrier molecule such as serum albumin (Garnett et al, 46 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>2407-2412 (1986); Ohkawa et al 23 <highlight><italic>Cancer Immunol. Immunother. </italic></highlight>81-86 (1986); Endo et al, 47 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>1076-1080 (1980)), dextran (Hurwitz et al, 2 <highlight><italic>Appl. Biochem. </italic></highlight>25-35 (1980); Manabi et al, 34 <highlight><italic>Biochem. Pharmacol. </italic></highlight>289-291 (1985); Dillman et al, 46 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>4886-4891 (1986); Shoval et al, 85 <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>8276-8280 (1988)), or polyglutamic acid (Tsukada et al, 73 <highlight><italic>J. Natl. Canc. Inst. </italic></highlight>721-729 (1984); Kato et al 27 <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>1602-1607 (1984); Tsukada et al, 52 <highlight><italic>Br. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>111-116 (1985)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A wide array of linker technologies has been employed for the preparation of such immunoconjugates and both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been investigated. In most cases, the full cytotoxic potential of the drugs could only be observed, however, if the drug molecules could be released from the conjugates in unmodified form at the target site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One of the cleavable linkers that has been employed for the preparation of antibody-drug conjugates is an acid-labile linker based on cis-aconitic acid that takes advantage of the acidic environment of different intracellular compartments such as the endosomes encountered during receptor mediated endocytosis and the lysosomes. Shen and Ryser introduced this method for the preparation of conjugates of daunorubicin with macromolecular carriers (102 <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </italic></highlight>1048-1054 (1981)). Yang and Reisfeld used the same technique to conjugate daunorubicin to an anti-melanoma antibody (80 <highlight><italic>J. Natl. Canc. Inst. </italic></highlight>1154-1159 (1988)). Dillman et al. also used an acid-labile linker in a similar fashion to prepare conjugates of daunorubicin with an anti-T cell antibody (48 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>6097-6102 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach, explored by Trouet et al, involved linking daunorubicin to an antibody via a peptide spacer arm (79 <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>626-629 (1982)). This was done under the premise that free drug could be released from such a conjugate by the action of lysosomal peptidases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In vitro cytotoxicity tests, however, have revealed that antibody-drug conjugates rarely achieved the same cytotoxic potency as the free unconjugated drugs. This suggested that mechanisms by which drug molecules are released from the antibodies are very inefficient. In the area of immunotoxins, conjugates formed via disulfide bridges between monoclonal antibodies and catalytically active protein toxins were shown to be more cytotoxic than conjugates containing other linkers. See, Lambert et al, 260 <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>12035-12041 (1985); Lambert et al, in <highlight><italic>Immunotoxins </italic></highlight>175-209 (A. Frankel, ed. 1988); Ghetie et al 48 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>2610-2617 (1988). This was attributed to the high intracellular concentration of glutathione contributing to the efficient cleavage of the disulfide bond between an antibody molecule and a toxin. Despite this, there are only a few reported examples of the use of disulfide bridges for the preparation of conjugates between drugs and macromolecules. Shen et al (260 <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>10905-10908 (1985)) described the conversion of methotrexate into a mercaptoethylamide derivative followed by conjugation with poly-D-lysine via a disulfide bond. Another report described the preparation of a conjugate of the trisulfide containing toxic drug calicheamycin with an antibody (Hinman et al., 53 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>3336-3342 (1993)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One reason for the lack of disulfide linked antibody-drug conjugates is the unavailability of cytotoxic drugs possessing a sulfur atom containing moiety that can be readily used to link the drug to an antibody via a disulfide bridge. Furthermore, chemical modification of existing drugs is difficult without diminishing their cytotoxic potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another major drawback with existing antibody-drug conjugates is their inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site because of the limited number of targeted antigens and the relatively moderate cytotoxicity of cancerostatic drugs like methotrexate, daunorubicin, and vincristine. In order to achieve significant cytotoxicity, linkage of a large number of drug molecules, either directly to the antibody or through a polymeric carrier molecule, becomes necessary. However, such heavily modified antibodies often display impaired binding to the target antigen and fast in vivo clearance from the blood stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In spite of the above described difficulties, useful cytotoxic agents comprising cell binding moieties and the group of cytotoxic drugs known as maytansinoids have been reported (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, and R. V. J. Chari, 31 <highlight><italic>Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews </italic></highlight>89-104 (1998)). Similarly, useful cytotoxic agents comprising cell binding moieties and analogues and derivatives of the potent antitumor antibotic CC-1065 have also been reported (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092 and 5,585,499). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Paclitaxel (Taxol), a cytotoxic natural product, and docetaxel (Taxotere), a semi-synthetic derivative (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), are widely used in the treatment of cancer. These compounds belong to the family of compounds called taxanes. Taxanes are mitotic spindle poisons that inhibit the depolymerization of tubulin, resulting in an increase in the rate of microtubule assembly and cell death. While docetaxel and paclitaxel are useful agents in the treatment of cancer, their antitumor activity is limited because of their non-specific toxicity towards normal cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, compounds like paclitaxel and docetaxel themselves are not sufficiently potent to be used in conjugates of cell binding agents. Recently, a few new docetaxel analogs with greater potency than either docetaxel or paclitaxel have been described (Iwao Ojima et al., <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>39, 3889-3896 (1996) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). However, these compounds lack a suitable functionality that allows linkage via a cleavable bond to cell binding agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a method of treating diseases with taxanes wherein their side effects are reduced without compromising their cytotoxicity is greatly needed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This invention is based on the synthesis of novel taxanes that retain high cytotoxicity and that can be effectively linked to cell binding agents. It has previously been shown that the linkage of highly cytotoxic drugs to antibodies using a cleavable link, such as a disulfide bond, ensures the release of fully active drug inside the cell, and such conjugates are cytotoxic in an antigen specific manner (R. V. J. Chari et al, 52 <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092; and 5,416,064). However, the art reveals that it is extremely difficult to modify existing drugs without diminishing their cytotoxic potential. The disclosed invention overcomes this problem by modifying the disclosed taxanes with chemical moieties, and especially ones containing thiol or disulfide groups, to which appropriate cell binding agents can be linked. As a result, the disclosed novel taxanes preserve, and in some cases could even enhance, the cytotoxic potency of known taxanes. The cell binding agent-taxane complexes permit the full measure of the cytotoxic action of the taxanes to be applied in a targeted fashion against unwanted cells only, therefore, avoiding side effects due to damage to non-targeted healthy cells. This invention permits the taxanes to be target site-directed which had previously been impossible. Thus, the invention provides useful agents for the elimination of diseased or abnormal cells that are to be killed or lysed such as tumor cells (particularly solid tumor cells), virus infected cells, microorganism infected cells, parasite infected cells, autoimmune cells (cells that produce autoantibodies), activated cells (those involved in graft rejection or graft vs. host disease), or any other type of diseased or abnormal cells, while exhibiting a minimum of side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The cytotoxic agent according to the present invention comprises one or more taxanes linked to a cell binding agent via a linking group. The linking group is part of a chemical moiety that is covalently bound to a taxane through conventional methods. In a preferred embodiment, the chemical moiety can be covalently bound to the taxane via an ether linkage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The taxanes useful in the present invention have the formula (I) shown below:

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The taxanes of the present invention that have a thiol- or disulfide-containing substituent are in themselves novel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The taxanes that have a thiol or disulfide-containing substituent can be synthesized according to known methods. The starting material for the synthesis is the commercially available 10-deacetylbaccatin III, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The chemistry to introduce various substituents is described in several publications (Ojima et al, <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>39, 3889-3896, (1996), Ojima et al., 40<highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>267-278 (1997); I. Ojima et al., 96 <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </italic></highlight>4256-4261 (1999); I. Ojima et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,011 and 5,811,452.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The substituent R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the phenyl ring and the position of the substituent R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>can be varied until a compound of the desired toxicity is obtained. Furthermore, the degree of substitution on the phenyl ring can be varied to achieve a desired toxicity. That is, the phenyl ring can have one or more substituents (e.g., mono-, di-, or tri-substitution of the phenyl ring) which provide another means for achieving a desired toxicity. High cytotoxicity is defined as exhibiting a toxicity having an IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>in the range of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12 </superscript></highlight>to 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9</superscript></highlight>M, when measured in vitro with cultured cancer cells upon a 72 hour exposure time to the drug. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the appropriate chemical moiety for R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the appropriate position for R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>using only routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> For example electron withdrawing groups at the meta position are expected to increase the cytotoxic potency, while substitution at the para position is not expected to increase the potency as compared to the parent taxane. Typically a few representative taxanes with substituents at the different positions (ortho, meta and para) will be initially prepared and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The disulfide or thiol-containing substituent can be introduced at one of the positions where a hydroxyl group already exists. The chemistry to protect the various hydroxyl groups, while reacting the desired one, has been described previously (see, for example, the references cited supra). The substituent is introduced by simply converting the free hydroxyl group to a disulfide-containing ether, a disulfide-containing ester, or a disulfide-containing carbamate. This transformation is achieved as follows. The desired hydroxyl group is deprotonated by treatment with the commercially available reagent lithium hexamethyldisilazane (1.2 equivalents) in tetrahydrofuran at &minus;40&deg; C. as described in I. Ojima et al, supra. The resulting alkoxide anion is then reacted with an excess of a dihalo compound, such as dibromoethane, to give a halo ether. Displacement of the halogen with a thiol (by reaction with potassium thioacetate and treatment with mild base or hydroxylamine) will provide the desired thiol-containing taxane. The thiol group can be converted into a methyl or pyridyl disulfide by reaction with methyl methane thiolsulfonate or dithiodipyridine respectively. This method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,064. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the desired hydroxyl group can be esterified directly by reaction with an acyl halide, such as 3-bromopropionyl chloride to give a bromo ester. Displacement of the bromo group by treatment with potassium thioacetate and further processing as described above will provide the thiol or disulfide-containing taxane ester. In order to prepare disulfide-containing carbamates, the hydroxyl group can be reacted with a commercially available chloroformate, such as para-nitrophenyl chloroformate followed by reaction with an amino alkyl disulfide (e.g., methyldithio cysteamine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Disulfide-containing and thiol-containing taxane drugs of the invention can be evaluated for their ability to suppress proliferation of various unwanted cell lines in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, cell lines such as the human epidermoid carcinoma line A431, the human breast tumor line SKBR3, and the Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma line Namalwa can easily be used for the assessment of cytotoxicity of these compounds. Cells to be evaluated can be exposed to the compounds for 72 hours and the surviving fractions of cells measured in direct assays by known methods. IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>values can then be calculated from the results of the assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The effectiveness of the compounds of the invention as therapeutic agents depends on the careful selection of an appropriate cell binding agent. Cell binding agents may be of any kind presently known, or that become known and include peptides and non-peptides. Generally, these can be antibodies, or fragments thereof, (especially monoclonal antibodies), lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as transferring, or any other cell binding molecule or substance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> transferrin (O&apos;Keefe et al, 260 <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>932-937 (1985)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Monoclonal antibody techniques allow for the production of extremely specific cell binding agents in the form of specific monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof. Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal antibodies, or fragments thereof, by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters, or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins such as viral coat proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Sensitized human cells can also be used. Another method of creating monoclonal antibodies, or fragments thereof, is the use of phage libraries of sFv (single chain variable region), specifically human sFv. (See e.g., Griffiths et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793; McCafferty et al., WO 92/01047; Liming et al., WO 99/06587.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Selection of the appropriate cell binding agent is a matter of choice that depends upon the particular cell population to be targeted, but in general monoclonal antibodies are preferred if an appropriate one is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example, the monoclonal antibody J5 is a murine IgG<highlight><subscript>2a </subscript></highlight>antibody that is specific for Common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Antigen (CALLA) (Ritz et al, 283 <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>583-585 (1980)) and can be used if the target cells express CALLA such as in the disease of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similarly, the monoclonal antibody anti-B4 is a murine IgG<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that binds to the CD19 antigen on B cells (Nadler et al, 131 <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>244-250 (1983)) and can be used if the target cells are B cells or diseased cells that express this antigen such as in non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma or chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Additionally, GM-CSF which binds to myeloid cells can be used as a cell binding agent to diseased cells from acute myelogenous leukemia. IL-2 which binds to activated T-cells can be used for prevention of transplant graft rejection, for therapy and prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and for treatment of acute T-cell leukemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> MSH which binds to melanocytes can be used for the treatment of melanoma. Folic acid, which targets the folate receptor expressed on ovarian and other cancers, is also a suitable cell binding agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Cancers of the breast and testes can be successfully targeted with estrogen (or estrogen analogues) or androgen (or androgen analogues) respectively as cell binding agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Conjugates of the taxanes of the invention and a cell binding agent can be formed using any techniques presently known or later developed. Numerous methods of conjugation are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,416,064 and 5,475,092. The taxane ester can be modified to yield a free amino group and then linked to an antibody or other cell binding agent via an acid labile linker or a photolabile linker. The taxane ester can be condensed with a peptide and subsequently linked to a cell binding agent to produce a peptidase labile linker. The hydroxyl group on the taxane ester can be succinylated and linked to a cell binding agent to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular esterases to liberate free drug. Most preferably, the taxane ethers, esters, or carbamates are treated to create a free or protected thiol group, and then the disulfide- or thiol-containing taxanes are linked to the cell binding agent via disulfide bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Representative conjugates of the invention are antibody-taxane, antibody fragment-taxane epidermal growth factor (EGF)-taxane, melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)-taxane, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-taxane, estrogen-taxane, estrogen analogue-taxane, androgen-taxane, androgen analogue-taxane, and folate-taxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Taxane conjugates of antibodies, antibody fragments, protein or peptide hormones, protein or peptide growth factors and other proteins are made in the same way by known methods. For example, peptides and antibodies can be modified with cross linking reagents such as N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP), 4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-&agr;-methyl-&agr;-(2-pyridyl dithio)-toluene (SMPT), N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) butyrate (SDPB), 2-iminothiolane, or S-acetylsuccinic anhydride by known methods.

The free or protected thiol-containing cell binding agent thus derived is then reacted with a disulfide- or thiol-containing taxane to produce conjugates. The conjugates can be purified by HPLC or by gel filtration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Similarly, for example, estrogen and androgen cell binding agents such as estradiol and androstenediol can be esterified at the C-17 hydroxy group with an appropriate disulfide containing carboxylic acid using e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a condensing agent. Examples of such carboxylic acids that can be employed are 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propanoic acid, 3-methyldithiopropanoic acid, 4-(2-pyridyldithio) pentanoic acid, and 3-phenyldithiopropanoic acid. Esterification of the C-17 hydroxy group can also be achieved by reaction with an appropriately protected thiol group containing carboxylic acid chloride such as 3-S-acetylpropanoyl chloride. Other methods of esterification can also be employed as described in the literature (Haslam, 36 <highlight><italic>Tetrahedron </italic></highlight>2409-2433 (1980)). The protected or free thiol containing androgen or estrogen can then be reacted with a disulfide- or thiol-containing taxane to produce conjugates. The conjugates can be purified by column chromatography on silica gel or by HPLC. Folic acid can be condensed with a suitable hydrazide such as 4-(2-pyridyldithio) pentanoic acid hydrazide in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide to give a hydrazone containing an active disulfide. The disulfide-containing folate can then be reacted with a thiol-containing taxane to produce a conjugate that can be purified by column chromatography over silica gel or by HPLC </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Preferably monoclonal antibody- or cell binding agent-taxane conjugates are those that are joined via a disulfide bond, as discussed above, that are capable of delivering taxane molecules. Such cell binding conjugates are prepared by known methods such as by modifying monoclonal antibodies with succinimidyl pyridyl-dithiopropionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al, 173 <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>723-737 (1978)). The resulting thiopyridyl group is then displaced by treatment with thiol-containing taxanes to produce disulfide linked conjugates. Alternatively, in the case of the aryldithio-taxanes, the formation of the cell binding conjugate is effected by direct displacement of the aryl-thiol of the taxane by sulfhydryl groups previously introduced into antibody molecules. Conjugates containing 1 to 10 taxane drugs linked via a disulfide bridge are readily prepared by either method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> More specifically, a solution of the dithiopyridyl modified antibody at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, at pH 6.5 containing 1 mM EDTA is treated with the thiol-containing taxane (1.25 molar eq./dithiopyridyl group). The release of thiopyridine from the modified antibody is monitored spectrophotometrically at 343 nm and is complete in about 20 hours. The antibody-taxane conjugate is purified and freed of unreacted drug and other low molecular weight material by gel filtration through a column of Sephadex G-25 or Sephacryl S300. The number of taxane moieties bound per antibody molecule can be determined by measuring the ratio of the absorbance at 230 nm and 275 nm. An average of 1-10 taxane molecules/antibody molecule can be linked via disulfide bonds by this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Antibody-taxane conjugates with non-cleavable links can also be prepared. The antibody can be modified with crosslinking reagents such as succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), sulfo-SMCC, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), sulfo-MBS or succinimidyl-iodoacetate, as described in the literature, to introduce 1-10 reactive groups.

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A preferred method is to modify antibodies, or fragments thereof, with succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) to introduce maleimido groups followed by reaction of the modified antibody or fragment with the thiol-containing taxanes to give a thioether linked conjugate. Again, conjugates with 1 to 10 drug molecules per antibody molecule result. </paragraph>

The remaining conjugate was diluted to 0.5 mg/mL, and dialyzed into 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing NaCl (50 mM), EDTA (2 mM) and 20% propylene glycol. The concentration of antibody TA1 was determined in both species by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The conjugates were formulated in PBS containing Tween 80 (0.01%) and HSA (1 mg/mL). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Taxanes can be esterified with N-protected amino acids, such as N-tboc-L-alanine in the presence of dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) by standard methods described in the chemical literature. Cleavage of the t-boc protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid will give a taxane ester containing a terminal amino group. This amino group containing taxane can be linked to antibodies, or fragments thereof, and other cell binding agents via an acid labile linker as previously described (Bl&auml;ttler et al, 24 <highlight><italic>Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>1517-1524 (1985), U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The amino group-containing taxane described above can also be linked to cell binding agents via peptide spacer linkers. It has been previously shown that short peptide spacers between drugs and macromolecular protein carriers are stable in serum but are readily hydrolyzed by intracellular lysosomal peptidases (Trouet et al, 79 <highlight><italic>Proc. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Nat&apos;l. Acad. Sci., 626-629 (1982)). The amino group containing taxane can be condensed with peptides such as Ala-Leu, Leu-Ala-Leu or a dimer of Ala-Leu using condensing agents such as 1-&lsqb;3-(dimethylamino)propyl&rsqb;-3-ethyl carbodiimide-HCl to give a peptide derivative of the taxane which can then be linked to cell binding agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">In vivo Anti-Tumor Activity </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The anti-tumor effect of anti-EGF receptor antibody-taxane conjugate on human squamous cancer (A431) xenografts in SCID mice was established as follows. The anti-tumor effect of two different anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-taxane conjugates (anti-EGFR-taxane conjugates), KS-61-Taxane and KS-77-Taxane was evaluated in a human tumor xenograft model in SCID mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Five week old female SCID mice (25 animals) were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with A-431 human squamous cancer cells (1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/mouse) in 0.1 mL of serum-free medium. The tumors were grown for 11 days to an average size of 100.0 mm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>(range of 54-145 mm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). The animals were then randomly divided into four groups (3 to 5 animals per group) according to their tumor size. The first group received KS-61-Taxane conjugate (10 mg/kg, qd&times;5) administered intravenously. The second group received the KS-77-Taxane conjugate (10 mg/kg, qd&times;5) administered intravenously. The third group received free (non-conjugated) taxane (0.24 mg/kg, qd&times;5, intravenously) at the same dose as that present in the conjugate. The fourth group, a control group, of animals received PBS using the same treatment schedule as in groups 1-3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The sizes of the tumors were measured twice weekly and the tumor volumes were calculated with the formula: &frac12;(length&times;width&times;height). The weight of the animals was also measured twice per week. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The tumors in the control group of mice grew to a size of nearly 1000 mm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in 31 days. Treatment with free taxane showed no therapeutic effect, and the tumors in this group grew at essentially the same rate as in the control group of animals that received PBS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In contrast, both of the anti-EGFR-taxane conjugates showed remarkable anti-tumor activity resulting in complete inhibition of tumor growth in all the treated animals for the duration of the experiment&mdash;34 days for the KS-61-Taxane conjugate and 27 days for the KS-77-Taxane conjugate. The data also show that targeted delivery of the taxane using a tumor-specific antibody is essential for the anti-tumor activity, since an equivalent dose of unconjugated taxane showed no anti-tumor effect in this model. Importantly, the doses of antibody-taxane conjugate used were non-toxic to the animals as demonstrated by the absence of any weight loss (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">In vitro Cytotoxicity of Antibody-Taxane Conjugates </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The cytotoxicity of anti-EGFR-taxane conjugate, KS-78-Taxane, was measured in a clonogenic assay using the EGF-receptor-positive human A431 cell line (ATCC CRL 1555). N901-taxane conjugate, a similar conjugate made with the mouse monoclonal N901 antibody against human CD56 was tested as a specificity control, since A431 cells do not express its target antigen, CD56. The cytotoxicity of TA.1-Taxane conjugate, a conjugate made with the mouse monoclonal antibody TA.1 against human Neu antigen, was measured on the antigen-positive human cell line SK-BR-3 (ATCC HTB 30) and the antigen-negative A431 cell line. Cells were plated at different densities in 6-well tissue-culture plates in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Immunoconjugates at varying concentrations were added and the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37&deg; C. and 6% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>until colonies of approximately 20 cells or more were formed (6 to 10 days). Control plates contained no immunoconjugate. The cells were then fixed with formaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted under a low-magnification microscope. Plating efficiencies were then determined from the colony numbers and surviving fractions of cells were calculated as the ratio of the plating efficiency of the treated sample and the plating efficiency of the control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the results of the cytotoxicity determination for the two Batches of KS-78-Taxane conjugate on the target antigen-positive cell line A431. Conjugates from both batches show similar toxicity to the target cells; treatment for 6 days at concentrations of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M achieved surviving fractions of less than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>(less than 1% of cells survive). A control conjugate, N901-Taxane, for which there are no antigens present on the surface of A431 cells, shows no toxicity to the cells at concentrations of up to 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M. Unconjugated KS-78 antibody also shows very little cytotoxic effect. These results demonstrate the target antigen-specific cytotoxicity of the KS-78-taxane conjugate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The cytotoxic potency and selectivity of the TA.1-taxane conjugate was assayed with the target antigen-positive cell line SK-BR-3 and the target antigen-negative cell line A431. The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. At a conjugate concentration of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>M, more than 90% of the target SK-BR-3 cells were killed (surviving fraction of less than 0.1), while no toxicity towards the non-target A431 cells was observed. These results demonstrate the selective killing of antigen-positive cells and that the cytotoxic effect of the conjugate is dependent on the specific binding through its antibody component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
