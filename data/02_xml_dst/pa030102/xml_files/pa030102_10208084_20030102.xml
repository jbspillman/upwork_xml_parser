<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are a number of diseases/conditions which directly affect the sexual lives of humans and animals. These include orgasmic disorders, lack of interest in sex and erectile dysfunction in males. In addition there are a number of diseases/conditions which indirectly affect the sexual lives of humans. There are a few pharmaceutical agents to treat this diseases/conditions and others in clinical development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,975 discloses that the compounds (A) of the present invention are useful to stimulate sexual activity and to alleviate impotence. The useful dosage range disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,975 is &ldquo;at least 10 mg up to about 1200 mg per day&rdquo;. The operable dosage range in the present invention is considerably lower. The compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,975 have been used in clinical trials to prove their usefulness in treating Parkinson&apos;s disease at a dose of 30 mg/person. Compounds (A) of the present invention are used at a dose of less than 8 mg in treating the sexual disturbances of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,975 generically discloses compounds where the variable substituent &ldquo;A&rdquo; can be either a carbonyl group (&mdash;CO&mdash;) or a thiocarbonyl (&mdash;CS&mdash;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,534 discloses sildenafil (VIAGRA&reg;).

PGE1 is a vasodilator and is sold as CAVERJECT&reg; to treat male erectile dysfunction. The compounds (A) of the present invention are not prostaglandins and are not injected into the penis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>International Journal of Impotence Research, </italic></highlight>10 (Supplement 3), August 1998, Abstracts &num;417 and 419 disclose that apomorphine, which is available in a number of countries to treat Parkinson&apos;s Disease, is in late-stage development as a sublingual formulation for treating male erectile dysfunction. The compounds (A) used in the present invention are not apomorphine analogs. U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,606 discloses sublingual use of apomorphine for treating erectile dysfunction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,211 discloses that yohimbine can be used to treat erectile dysfunction. The compounds of formula (A) are quite different chemically as compared to yohimbine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes four separate methods of treating sexual problems. First, it is a method of treating sexual disturbances in a human who is in need of such treatment which comprises administering a sexually therapeutic amount of a compound of the formula (A) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Second, it includes a method of inducing mating a non-human mammal which comprises administering a sexually mating amount of a compound of the formula (A) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Thirdly, it includes a method of treating a sexual deficiency state in a human who has a disease/condition the primary pathology of which does not relate to sexual disfunction, but indirectly produces reduced sexual functioning. The diseases/conditions which can produce this type of sexual disfunction include epilepsy, craniopharyngioma, hypogonadism or who has had a hysterectomyoophorectomy, hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Fourthly, there are individuals who do not appear to have any sexual disturbance or disease/condition which will produced an adverse effect on their sexual lives, but none the less wish to increase their sexual desire, interest or sexual performance and who will benefit by use of the compounds of formula (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula (A), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which are useful in the method of treatment of the present invention are known, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,975. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is selected from the group consisting of salts of the following acids methanesulfonic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, benzoic, citric, tartaric, fumaric, maleic, CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COOH where n is 0 thru 4, HOOC&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COOH where n is as defined above. It is preferred that the compound of formula (A) have n be 0, A be C&boxH;O and D be NH. It is more preferred that the compound of formula (A) be either (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one or (5R)-5-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinoline-2(1H)-thione. It is more preferred that the compound of formula (A) be (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A preferred process to produce the preferred compounds within the scope of the compounds of formula (A) is set forth in PREPARATION 1 and the numerical EXAMPLEs as well as CHART A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Non-human mammals include commercial animals (horses, cattle, swine, sheep and transgenic mice) and zoo animals (panda bears, elephants, zebras, lions, tigers, monkeys and apes), sporting animals (horses and dogs) as well as domesticated animals (dogs and cats). The humans and non-human mammals both be either a male or female. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The sexual disturbances in humans treated by the present invention include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile disorder, female orgasmic disorder and male orgasmic disorder. The sexual disturbances of the present invention are known to those skilled in the art and are adequately described for a medical practitioner. In particular, see Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, (DSM-IV), American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C., 1994 as well as the DSM-UV Guidebook, American Psychiatric Press, Inc., Washington D.C., 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When inducing mating in the non-human mammals it is desirable to treat one member of the mating pair in some cases. This is most likely to be the situation where previous attempts at mating the pair have failed and one member of the pair is not known to have prior offspring. In that case, this member would be advantageously treated. In other cases, it may be desirable to treat both the male and female prior to the anticipated mating. The latter is most likely to be advantageous when the intended mating is between sexually inexperienced animals and prior attempts at mating the pair have failed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula (A) are also useful in treating humans whose primary disease, condition or situation is not one of sexual disfunction, but rather the primary disease or condition leads to a secondary clinical situation where the human (male or female) experiences diminished sexual desire, interest and/or function. These diseases include epilepsy, craniopharyngioma, hypogonadism or who has had a hysterectomyoophorectomy, hysterectomy or oophorectomy and can produce a sexual deficiency state which is treated in the same way as those individuals who have one or more of the five sexual disturbances identified above. The sexually therapeutic effective amount is the same and is administered in the same way by the same routes of administration as for those humans who have sexual disturbances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula (A) are also useful in increasing sexual desire, interest or performance in individuals who do not have any of the five sexual disturbances nor any of the following diseases or conditions, epilepsy, craniopharyngioma, hypogonadism or who has had a hysterectomyoophorectomy, hysterectomy or oophorectomy. These individuals are treated the same way as those having any of the five sexual disturbances. The sexually useful effective amount to be used here is the same as the sexually therapeutically effective amount for those with sexual disturbances. The sexually useful therapeutically effective amount is administered in the same way by the same routes of administration as for those humans who have sexual disturbances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In (1) treating the sexual disturbances of humans, (2) inducing mating of non-human mammals, (3) treating humans whose primary disease or condition leads to a secondary clinical situation where the human experiences diminished sexual desire, interest and/or function and (4) increasing the sexual desire, interest or performance in individuals who do not have any of the above problems the compounds of formula (A) in the known appropriate pharmaceutical dosage form for a given route of administration may be administered orally, intra-nasally, buccally, intra-pulmonary, parenterally and rectally. For treating humans, it is preferred that the compound of formula (A) be administered orally, intra-nasally, buccally and intra-pulmonarlly; it is more preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered orally. For treating non-human mammals, it is preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered orally, parenterally and rectally; it is more preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered orally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The operable sexually therapeutic effective amount as well as the operable sexually useful effective amount of the compounds of formula (A) is from about 0.2 thru about 8 mg/person/dose. It is preferred that the sexually therapeutic effective amount and sexually useful effective amount is from about 0.5 thru about 5 mg/person/dose. It is more preferred that the sexually therapeutic effective amount and sexually useful effective amount is from about 1 thru about 3 mg/person/dose. If doses less than this are used the desired effect will not be obtained. If doses greater than this are used, undesirable side effects occur and the desired effect will not be obtained. The term &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; is used in treating a disease or condition; the term &ldquo;useful&rdquo; is used when treating humans who do not have one of the above diseases or conditions which cause sexual dysfunction but who are considered normal and who wish to increase their sexual desire, interest or performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The operable sexually mating amount of the compounds of formula (A) is from about 0.003 thru about 0.2 mg/kg/dose. It is preferred that the sexually mating amount is from about 0.01 thru about 0.125 mg/kg/dose. It is more preferred that the sexually mating amount is from about 0.025 thru about 0.075 mg/kg/dose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To obtain the desired effect in humans, the sexually therapeutic effective amount or sexually useful effective amount of the compounds of formula (A) should be administered from about 10 minutes to about 8 hr prior to sexual activity. It is preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered from about 0.5 hr to about 1 hr prior to sexual activity. It is more preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered about 0.5 hr prior to sexual activity. Sexual activity includes sexual intercourse with or without orgasm, ejaculation, masturbation and sexual foreplay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> To obtain the desired mating effect in non-human mammals, the compounds of formula (A) is administered from about 10 minutes to about 8 hr prior to mating. It is preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered from about 10 minutes to about 1 hr prior to mating. It is more preferred that the compounds of formula (A) be administered from about 10 minutes to about 0.5 hr prior to mating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the humans do not have Parkinson&apos;s disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the in humans administration of the compounds of formula (A) does not produce postural hypotension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further illustrated by EXAMPLES A-P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The exact dosage of the compounds of formula (A) which are useful in the four methods of this invention depends on the route of administration, the particular compound used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, general physical condition of the particular patient, other medication the individual may be taking as is well known to those skilled in the art and can be more accurately determined by measuring the blood level or concentration of the compound and/or metabolite in the patient&apos;s blood and/or the patient&apos;s response to the particular condition being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula (A) can also be used with other agents in (1) treating the five sexual disturbances, (2) in inducing mating of a non-human mammal, (3) in treating a sexual deficiency state in humans who have one or more of the following diseases/conditions&mdash;epilepsy, craniopharyngioma, hypogonadism or who has had a hysterectomyoophorectomy, hysterectomy or oophorectomy or (4) increasing sexual desire, interest or performance in a human who does not have any sexual disturbance or one of the above diseases/conditions. It is known that vascular smooth muscle relaxation is necessary for vascular engorgement of the penis and the clitoris during normal male and female sexual behavior and that agents which promote vascular engorgement of the penis and clitoris are useful in enhancing sexual motivation, desire and performance. Agents which effectuate vascular smooth muscle relaxation include phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. such as sildenafil (Viagra) and ICOS-351; phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitors, such as milrinone; non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as papaverine; nitric oxide donor drugs such as linsidomine; alpha type 1 adrenergic receptor antagonists such as phentolamine produce relaxation of vascular smooth muscle from human penis in the presence of norepinephrine; alpha type 2 adrenergic receptor antagonists such as yohimbine; prostaglandin E1 receptor agonists such as PGE1 (CAVERJECTT&trade; Injection and MUSE&trade;); as well as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> These vascular smooth muscle relaxation agents are administered by oral, parenteral, buccal, rectal, intranasal, intrapulmonary, intraurethral or topical routes. The preferred route of administration will depend on the specific properties of the drug(s) to be combined with the compound(s) of formula (A). The preferred route of administration for a phosphodiesterase type 3 or 5 receptor inhibitor and an alpha type 1 or 2 adrenergic receptor inhibitor is oral. The preferred route of administration for a prostaglandin E receptor agonist, nitric oxide donor, non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and VIP is intracavemosal injection or intraurethral topical administration in male mammals or topical administration to the vulva in the female. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The dose of some of the vascular smooth muscle relaxation agents is known to those skilled in the art, especially for sildenafil (VIAGRA&trade; Tablets), PGE1 (CAVERJECT&trade; Injection and MUSE&trade;). For yohimbine the dose is about 1 to about 10 mg orally and can be given about three or four times daily as a routine. For phentolamine the dose is about 2 to about 40 mg orally or by bucal patch or about 0.5 to about 5 mg when given by intracavernosal injection. For papaverine the dose is about 4 to about 20 mg given by intracavernosal injection. For VIP the dose is about 5 to about 60 mg when given by intracavernosal injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the compounds of formula (A) are used in conjunction with the vascular smooth muscle relaxation agents the compounds of formula (A) should be administered within the time frame discussed above. The sexually effective time period for administration of the vascular smooth muscle relaxation agents is well known for sildenafil (VIAGRA&trade; Tablets), PGE1 (CAVERJECT&trade; Injection and MUSE&trade;) The sexually effective time period for administration of yohimbine is about 0 to about 4 hours before sexual activity; for phentolamine it is about 0 to about 4 hours prior to sexual activity when given orally or buccally and about 0 to about 2 hours when given by intracaernosal injection; for papaverine and VIP it is about 0 to about 2 hours prior to sexual activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When used in combination, the preferred combinations are (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one and sildenafil, (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one and PGE1, (5R)-5-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinoline-2(1H)-thione and sildenafil or (5R)-5-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinoline-2(1H)-thione and PGE1. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout this entire document including both the specification and the claims. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">I. CONVENTIONS FOR FORMULAS AND DEFINITIONS OF VARIABLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The carbon atom content of variable substituents is indicated in one of two ways. The first method uses a prefix to the entire name of the variable such as &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;, where both &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;4&rdquo; are integers representing the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the variable. The prefix is separated from the variable by a space. For example, &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkyl&rdquo; represents alkyl of 1 through 4 carbon atoms, (including isomeric forms thereof unless an express indication to the contrary is given). Whenever this single prefix is given, the prefix indicates the entire carbon atom content of the variable being defined. Thus C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkoxycarbonyl describes a group CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;O&mdash;CO&mdash; where n is zero, one or two. By the second method the carbon atom content of only each portion of the definition is indicated separately by enclosing the &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; designation in parentheses and placing it immediately (no intervening space) before the portion of the definition being defined. By this optional convention (C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)alkoxycarbonyl has the same meaning as C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkoxycarbonyl because the &ldquo;C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; refers only to the carbon atom content of the alkoxy group. Similarly while both C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>alkoxyalkyl and (C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)alkoxy(C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)alkyl) define alkoxyalkyl groups containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the two definitions differ since the former definition allows either the alkoxy or alkyl portion alone to contain 4 or 5 carbon atoms while the latter definition limits either of these groups to 3 carbon atoms. </paragraph>

The patient recently began to co-habitate with a 28 year old man. She consulted a clinical psychologist because of distress over frequent arguments with her partner. These arguments concern her frustration that her partner is unwilling to marry her and the partner&apos;s accusations that she is sexually unresponsive and &ldquo;boring in bed.&rdquo; The patient reports that although she desires to continue the relationship, she has little or no interest in sexual activity with this partner. The partner initiates all sexual activity in the relationship and she complies so that the relationship will continue. She states that her partner desires sexual intercourse about once per day. Occasionally, the couple&apos;s frequency of sexual intercourse is as much as twice per day. She reports that she does not have sexual fantasies since the present relationship began. The patient had a previous relationship with a man that lasted 3 years and involved sexual activity that she found sexually exciting and satisfying. The patient has recently had a physical examination by her family physician, the findings of which were unremarkable. She currently takes no prescription drugs other than low dose birth control pills. She does not routinely use over-the-counter medications or alcohol and denies taking drugs of abuse. The patient is diagnosed as having Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder of acquired onset due to situational factor (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 1994). (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1) is prescribed at 1 mg/dose to be taken 0.5 hr before the patient intends to engage in sexual activity. The patient is instructed that she may use the drug on a daily basis, if she and her partner desire sexual activity at this frequency. She is also instructed that on occasions she may use the drug twice in a single day if this is the intended frequency of intercourse. The patient is examined after one month. She reports that she uses the drug once, and occasionally twice, per day. She reports that she has sexual fantasies on 3-4 occasions per week, occasionally initiates sexual activity with her partner, and enjoys an improved sexual relationship with her partner. She also reports that she and her partner argue less frequently and that her partner no longer accuses her of being disinterested in sexual relations.

He presents complaining that for the past six months he has had difficulty maintaining an erection until completion of sexual intercourse. He develops an adequate erection at the beginning of sexual activity but detumescence occurs when he attempts penetration. His wife is his only current sexual partner. He reports that his wife is patient and understanding of his problem but that he is embarrassed, feels that he is a failure, and is growing progressively more angry and sad about his inability to maintain an erection. He masturbates approximately twice each month. During masturbation, he is usually able to maintain an erection until he ejaculates. The patient has recently had a physical examination by his family physician. The only remarkable findings were a supine diastolic blood pressure 94 mm mercury and a total plasma cholesterol level of 230 mg/dl. He was instructed to follow the American Heart Association dietary recommendations and to reduce his body weight by 5 kg. He currently takes no prescription drugs. He does not routinely use over-the-counter medications or alcohol and denies taking drugs of abuse. The patient is diagnosed as having Male Erectile Disorder that is acquired and situational. The etiology is most likely due to psychological factors, although combined factors, e.g., mild hypertension or atherosclerosis, may contribute (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 1994).

<heading lvl="1">Mating of Animals of Commercial Value </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> An adult male Giant Panda on temporary loan from a foreign zoo is desired to have breed to an adult female Giant Panda which is normally resident at the zoo. Because of the commercial value of a potential off-spring it is desirable that the animals mate during the time the adult male is on loan. Both animals are sexually inexperienced and do not engage in intercourse during a two week period. As an alternative to anesthetizing the animals for a facilitated transfer of semen between the animals, the male and female Giant Pandas have (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (II) added to their diet on one occasion. The concentration of drug in the diet is calculated to deliver 0.05 mg of free base equivalents of (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1) per kilogram of body weight. One hour after ingesting the diet containing drug, the animals engage in sexual intercourse. A pregnancy and subsequent birth of an off-spring results from this intercourse. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A 40 year old, 75 kg male patient has idiopathic epilepsy. He first presented with primary generalized seizures at age 15 years and was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. He has been treated with carbamazepine since age 20. Currently he receives 500 mg/day of the drug. He has had two tonic-clonic seizures during the preceding year. The patient complains of diminished sexual interest in his wife of 8 years. On those occasions when he attempts sexual intercourse, he is able to maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse one-third of the time. He indicates that this problem has had a gradual onset over the previous 5 years. He reports that he rarely has sexual fantasies and rarely masturbates. The patient has recently had a physical examination by his family physician, the findings of which were unremarkable. He currently takes no prescription drugs other than carbamazepine. He does not routinely use over-the-counter medications or alcohol and denies taking drugs of abuse. A penile injection test with Caverject&trade; Injection results in a normal erection and duplex Doppler ultrasonography indicates an intact vascular system. Plasma testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin assays are performed. The plasma testosterone level is 25 nM, which is considered normal. The plasma sex hormone binding globulin level is 55 nM, which is considered elevated compared to the normal range. The patient is diagnosed with hypogonadism, secondary to chronic carbamazepine treatment (Epilepsia 36: 366-370, 1995). (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1) is prescribed at 3 mg/dose to be taken 0.5 hr before the patient intends to engage in sexual activity. The patient is instructed that he may use the drug on a daily basis, if this is the intended frequency of sexual activity. The patient is examined after one month. He reports that he take the drug 2-3 times per week. After taking the drug, he feels more interest in sex and usually initiates sexual activity with his wife. He reports that enjoys a normal sexual relationship. The patient is instructed to continue with the treatment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Reduced Sexual Function in a Male Patient with Erectile Dysfunction and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A 55 year old, 70 kg, male patient is apparently in good health. He presents complaining of a loss of sexual desire and frequent erectile dysfunction since taking an executive position in his company, six weeks previously. He reports that he works long hours and feels a high degree of pressure associated with his job. He is frustrated and angry that when he takes time off from work he is unable to have an intimate relationship with his wife. He reports that although he is periodically interested in initiating sexual relations, on most occasions he is unable to maintain a high level of interest sufficiently long to initiate or to adequately respond to his wife&apos;s initiating sexual activity. He further indicates that for the past six months, he has had difficulty maintaining an erection until completion of sexual intercourse. He develops a semi-rigid erection at the beginning of sexual activity but detumescence occurs when he attempts penetration. He reports that he has few erotic fantasies. He has not masturbated for the past several months. He attributes this to a lack of motivation and interest. The patient has recently had a physical examination by his family physician, the findings of which were unremarkable. He does not routinely use over-the-counter medications or alcohol and denies taking drugs of abuse. (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1), 3 mg/dose, and sildenafil (VIAGRA Tablets), 50 mg/dose, are both prescribed. Each is to be taken orally about 0.5 hr before the patient intends to engage in sexual activity. The patient is instructed that he may use the drug combination on a daily basis, if this is the intended frequency of sexual activity. The patient is examined after one month. He reports that he takes the drug combination 2-3 times per week. After taking the drug combination he feels motivated to initiate sexual activity, readily has sexual fantasies that are sustained during sexual intercourse, and has no difficulty maintaining an erection to completion of sexual intercourse. He reports that he enjoys an improved sexual relationship with his partner. The patient is advised to continue taking the (5R)-(methylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-imidazo&lsqb;4,5,1-ij&rsqb;quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1) for another six months as he adapts to the situational stress associated with his new job. After this time he is advised to stop taking the drug for a period of two weeks to determine whether his sexual motivation and desire have returned to the level he enjoyed prior to the change in jobs. </paragraph>
