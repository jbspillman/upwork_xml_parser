<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an application head for the contact-free application of liquid media such as thermoplastic plastics or melted hot-melt adhesives to a width of material which is movable relative to the application head, having a housing, having a control slide chamber in the housing, in which control slide chamber a cylinder control slide is supported so as to be rotatingly drivable, having at least one supply aperture for introducing a medium into the control slide chamber, and having a slotted nozzle for releasing the medium, which slotted nozzle is controllable by the cylinder control slide and extends transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An application head of the above-mentioned type is known from P 197 14 029.7 wherein use is made of a control slide which, in an axial region containing the supply aperture, is provided with a recess which extends over the entire circumference. At least in said axial region it is not possible to arrange an exit nozzle aperture which is controlled by the control slide. This means that, in said axial region, the exit nozzle apertures have to observe an undesirably large distance. In addition, the control slide is relatively short. If it comprised a greater length, it would be necessary to provide a plurality of supply apertures, so that the above-referred problem would occur several times along the slotted nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> From U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,689 it is known to apply adhesive from slotted nozzles on to which there are directed air supply means which lead to swirling of the emerging adhesive threads, whose purpose it is to prevent adhesive threads from tearing off and to prevent the formation of drops which could lead to a non-uniform application of adhesive. Because of the need to supply air, the application heads become complicated and expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Application heads of the above-mentioned type find frequent application in those cases where widths of material have to be laminated on to a substrate. To minimise the specific consumption of liquid medium and, at the same time, to ensure as uniform a distribution of the medium as possible, the medium is applied intermittently to achieve a grid-like application pattern. In order to permit, at the same time, a high transport speed of the width of material, the medium has to be applied in the direction of movement of the width of material at a high frequency, with the grid points extending transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material having to be arranged as closely as possible to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> From EP 0 474 155 A2 and EP 0 367 985 A2 there are known application heads in the case of which hole type nozzles are controlled by a pneumatically operated nozzle needle each. When the width of material moves at a high speed, the medium cannot be applied economically because of the limited maximum cycle frequency of the nozzle units, such limitation being the result of the mass inertia of the nozzle needles and of the control elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the object of the invention to provide an application head of the above-mentioned type which, even if it comprises a great length, is able to achieve an extremely dense application pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The objective is achieved in that the cylinder control slide has the following characteristics: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> an inner cavity which can be supplied with medium through the supply aperture, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> a cylindrical surface which can seal the slotted nozzle from the inside, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> surface grooves in the cylindrical surface which, as a function of their rotational positions, are able to communicate with the slotted nozzle, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> radial exit bores extending from the inner cavity into the surface grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The inventive application head is advantageous in that medium control takes place directly at the slotted nozzle, so that the dispensing accuracy cannot be adversely affected by the toughness of the medium or the elasticity of the medium behind the control region. By supplying the slotted nozzle with medium from the inside of the cylinder control slide it is possible for exit apertures to be arranged across the entire length of the cylinder control slide at, technically, the shortest possible distance without the possibility of any interference. By selecting different shapes of the surface grooves, it is possible to produce different grids and patterns when applying the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a first advantageous embodiment it is proposed that the surface grooves comprise a plurality of axis-parallel grooves. If a uniform point grid is to be achieved, it is advantageous to provide a plurality of axis-parallel surface grooves at uniform circumferential distances on the surface of the cyinder control slide. The distances between the grid points in the direction of movement of the width of material can be influenced by changing the rotational speed of the cylinder control slide. If the surface grooves are circumferentially distributed at non-uniform distances, a non-uniform point grid can be produced at a constant driving speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the axis-parallel surface grooves are arranged at uniform circumferential distances, a non-uniform point grid can be achieved by changing the driving speeds of the cylinder control slide. State-of-the-art servomotors for controlling purposes are capable of operating at non-uniform driving speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Grid points extending transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material can be achieved by using, in the slotted nozzle, a suitable nozzle orifice plate with individual bores spaced at short distances. If such a nozzle orifice plate is not provided, the use of axis-parallel grooves leads to a linear application transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a second advantageous embodiment, the surface grooves can comprise at least one helical or spiral-shaped groove, as a result of which there occur open regions at the slotted nozzle which, when driving the cylinder control slide in one rotational direction, move along the slotted nozzle so that, if the width of material moves at the same time, there occur application patterns which extend diagonally across the width of material. In this embodiment, it is preferable to use slotted nozzles without nozzle orifice plates, so that said diagonal applications are applied to the width of material in the form of threads. In such a case it can be advantageous to use two application heads arranged one behind the other with oppositely directed surface groove pitches with identical rotational directions of movement or with opposed rotational directions of movement and identical pitches, thereby making it possible to produce on the width of material a pattern of diagonal threads of medium intersecting one another symmetrically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cylinder control slide is provided with at least one journal which axially projects from the housing and in which there is formed an axial bore which is connected to the inner cavity and serves as a supply aperture. This measures makes the housing design particularly simple, but there must be provided a rotating seal in the region of the medium supply means subjected to pressure. According to an alternative embodiment, at at least one end of the housing, there is provided a bore in the housing and an annular channel between the cylinder control slide and the control slide chamber, which annular channel is connected to the bore in the housing, and there are provided radial supply bores in the cylinder control slide in the plane of the annular channel, which are connected to the inner cavity and serve as supply apertures. As a result of this measure, it is possible to simplify the control slide bearing. The medium can be supplied to the housing via simple radial bores. Said annular channel can be formed by an annular groove in the cylinder control slide surface and/or by a circumferential groove in the control slide chamber bore. The annular channel can also be arranged in the region of the end faces of a cylinder control slide being reduced at the journals, in which case the radial supply bores are replaced by axial supply bores in said end faces. Independently of whether supply means are provided at only one end or at both ends of the cylinder control slide, it is possible&mdash;for compensating for a slight pressure loss in the medium along the length of the control slide&mdash;to slightly increase the diameter of the radial exit bores leading to the grooves. The medium can be prevented from escaping from the housing by using conventional shaft seals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the objective is achieved by the cylinder control slide having the following characteristics: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> a cylindrical surface which can seal the slotted nozzle from the inside, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> at least one helical or spiral-shaped surface groove in the cylindrical surface, which, as a function of its rotational position, in certain portions, is able to communicate with the slotted nozzle, as well as </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a storage volume for medium inside the control slide chamber, which storage volume communicates with at least one surface groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At the points of intersection between the slotted nozzle and the convolution of the spiral-shaped surface groove, the inventive application head generates exit apertures which move in one direction along the nozzle slot when the cylinder control slide rotates. As a result, when the drive of the cylinder control slide rotates and when the width of material is simultaneously driven in the direction of movement, there is produced an infinite number of parallel threads which extend diagonally to the direction of movement of the width of material. In consequence, the medium is applied continuously in the longitudinal direction of the width of material, and the thread thickness can be kept very small. Provided the pitch of the spiral-shaped surface groove is slight and if a plurality of convolutions is provided, it is possible to achieve a very close application pattern. In an advantageous embodiment, it is possible to provide two application heads which are arranged one behind the other and which, if their cylinder control slides are driven in identical rotational directions, comprise oppositely directed surface groove pitches or, if the surface grooves have identical pitches, comprise oppositely directed driving rotational directions of the cylinder control slides. If both application heads are actuated and supplied with medium at the same time, a web of intersecting diagonal threads is formed on the width of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment it is proposed that the control slide chamber, in at least one circumferential region, is widened relative to the cross-section of the cylinder control slide and that the widened cavity between the wall of the control slide chamber and the surface of the cylinder control slide forms the storage volume. This embodiment comprises both a simple housing shape and a simple shape of the solidly produced cylinder control slide. The distances between the individual exit apertures and the storage volume are extremely short and are formed by the individual convolutions of the surface groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment, it is proposed that the cylinder control slide comprises an inner cavity which forms the storage volume and that the control slide chamber surrounds the cylinder control slide substantially sealingly with a cylindrical surface, with the radial bores leading from the inner cavity into the surface groove. The variant described here is advantageous in that the surface groove is radially supplied with medium over an extremely short distance, with the transport of material in the longitudinal direction of the surface groove being eliminated completely. As a result, control precision of the exit apertures is increased. To compensate for any pressure losses along the length of the inner cavity, the size of the radial bores can increase with the distance from the supply point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the former embodiment, a housing bore can be connected to the inside of the control slide chamber which forms said supply aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment, the cylinder control slide can comprise at least one journal which projects from the housing and which is provided with an axial bore which forms the supply aperture leading to the inside of the cylinder control slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative to the second embodiment, it is proposed that at least one housing bore is connected to an annular channel between the control slide chamber and the cylinder control slide and that radial bores, starting from the annular channel, lead into the inside of the cylinder control slide and form the at least one supply aperture. In this way, first the inside of the cylinder control slide is supplied with medium via the annular channel. From the inside of the cylinder control slide, the medium again enters the surface groove via the radial bores.</paragraph>

One end of a cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> projects from the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the application head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The direction of rotation of the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with two supply muffs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via which medium is supplied, as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Underneath the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, there is shown a slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from which there emerges a spray curtain <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The spray curtain <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> hits a width of material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> whose direction of movement is symbolised by an arrow <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. On the width of material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the spray curtain <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> generates an application grid <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shows alternately a continuous and an interrupted line pattern. This demonstrates that the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided with a orifice plate which determines the distance between the grid lines extending transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the detail, the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, on its cylindrical surface, comprises a plurality of continuous axial grooves <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and interrupted axial grooves <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in which there end radial bores <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The radial bores <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are supplied with medium via the muffs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and through circumferential grooves <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> provided with radial bores <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and via an inner cavity <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> forming a storage volume for medium. Via the radial bores <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the axial grooves <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are constantly filled with medium. The cylinder control slide can be driven by a servomotor via a journal which is positioned opposite the journal <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and which can also project from the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In a cross-sectional view, the housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has to be assumed to have the same shape as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The direction of rotation of the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The end of the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is provided with a journal <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which is provided with an axial bore <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through which medium is supplied, as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Underneath the housing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, there can be seen a slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from which there emerges a spray curtain <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The spray curtain <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> hits a width of material <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> whose direction of movement is symbolised by an arrow <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. On the width of material <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the spray curtain <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> generates an application grid <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which comprises a diagonal parallel line pattern. This demonstrates that the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is provided with a orifice plate which determines the distance between the lines extending transversely to the direction of movement of the width of material <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the detail, the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, on its cylindrical surface, is provided with a helical groove <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> in which there end radial bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The radial bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are supplied with medium via the axial bore <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and the inner cavity <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which forms a storage volume for medium. Via the radial bores <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the helical groove <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is constantly filled with medium.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an application head <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with a housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in which there rotates a cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> whose journal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> projects from the front end of the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> can be seen underneath the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the detail, the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> comprises a spiral-shaped surface groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The cross-sectional illustration shows that the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, at a distance therefrom, is surrounded by a control slide chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and only in the region of nozzle slot <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, is the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> in sealing contact with the surface of said control slide chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In a circumferential region, the surface groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is shown in section. The control slide chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is supplied with medium through attaching muffs <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> from where the medium enters the surface groove directly. In the case of driving of the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> indicated by a rotary arrow, the sectional regions move between the surface groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the nozzle slot <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> from left to right along the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. From the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> there emerges a material curtain of individual threads which, on a width of material <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, during transport, forms a group of adhesive threads extending diagonally relative to the width of material. The direction of movement of the width of material <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is indicated by an arrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an application head <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> with a housing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in which there rotates a cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> whose journal <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> projects from the front end of the housing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can be seen underneath the housing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the detail, the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is provided with a spiral-shaped surface groove <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in the sectional illustration, the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is sealingly enclosed by a cylindrical control slide chamber <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> comprises an inner cavity <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> which is supplied with medium through an axial bore <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in the journal <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, from which inner cavity <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> the medium passes through a plurality of radial bores <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> into the surface groove <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. From there, the medium can emerge through a controlled nozzle slot <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The size of the radial bores <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> increases with the distance from the medium supply through the axial bore <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in order to compensate for any pressure decrease in the medium. In a circumferential region, the surface groove <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is shown in section. In the case of driving of the cylinder control slide <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> indicated by a rotary arrow, the sectional regions between the surface groove <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the nozzle slot <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> move from left to right along the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. From the slotted nozzle <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> there emerges a material curtain of individual threads which, on the width of material <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, forms a group of adhesive threads extending diagonally relative to said width of material. The direction of movement of the width of material <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>.
