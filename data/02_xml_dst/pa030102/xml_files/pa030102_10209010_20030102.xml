<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The roof baggage supporting device, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a lateral beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a fastening device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A side rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is interposed between and fastened by a support jaw <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a fastening jaw <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the fastening device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

More specifically, in order to reduce the amount of movement of the roof carrier as shown by the arrow J of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the fastening force (fastening torque) needs to be increased. Consequently, the size and weight of the fastening device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is further increased. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In consideration of this, it is an object of the present invention to provide a roof carrier mounting structure capable of reducing the amount of movement of a roof carrier during a large (rapid) acceleration or deceleration of a vehicle with a small fastening force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is a roof carrier mounting structure for mounting a roof carrier on a member to which a roof carrier is mounted of a vehicle, comprising: a roof carrier; and an inclined portion formed on the roof carrier and inclined to gradually approach or move away from a member to which a roof carrier is mounted in a longitudinal direction of a vehicle for converting inertia force acting on the vehicle in the longitudinal direction into a fastening force for fastening the roof carrier to the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the roof carrier sandwiches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted so that the roof carrier is mounted on the member to which a roof-carrier is mounted. Normally, that is, in the case where; acceleration or a deceleration is not acting on the vehicle or when acceleration or deceleration is acting on the vehicle but has a value equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, the roof carrier reliably sandwiches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. Consequently, the roof carrier does not move unnecessarily in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The roof carrier is provided with an inclined portion which is inclined to gradually approach or move away from the member to which a roof carrier is mounted in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. When a large inertia force acts on the roof carrier and the load in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle during a rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle, the inclined portion causes the inertia force in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle to be converted into fastening force with which the roof carrier fastens the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. Consequently, the roof carrier sandwiches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted by a new fastening force generated during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle in addition to the original sandwiching force (fastening force). Thus, the sandwiching force (fastening force) with which the roof carrier sandwiches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted is increased during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. Therefore, the resistance to movement of the roof carrier is increased. Consequently, the amount of movement of the roof carrier due to the inertia force is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus, a part of the inertia force acting on the roof carrier and the load during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle is utilized to further increase the sandwiching force by which the roof carrier sandwiches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. Therefore, even if the sandwiching force of the roof carrier itself is small, the amount of movement of the roof carrier can be reduced to a level less than in the prior art during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. Since it is not necessary to increase the sandwiching force of the roof carrier itself, the size and weight of the roof carrier can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the present invention is the roof carrier mounting structure according to the first aspect of the present invention, wherein the roof carrier includes: a roof carrier main body; a sandwiching member provided on the roof carrier main body for sandwiching the member to which a roof carrier is mounted between the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member; and a floating brake mounted on at least one of the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member such that the floating brake can abut against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted and having at least a portion which abuts against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted able to be elastically deformed, wherein the inclined portion includes: a first inclined face formed on the floating brake which gradually approaches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted the closer to the front of the vehicle; and a second inclined face formed on the floating brake which gradually approaches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted the closer to the rear of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in normal conditions, that is, when acceleration or deceleration is not acting on the vehicle or when acceleration or deceleration is acting on the vehicle but has a value equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, the floating brake abuts against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted and both the floating brake and member to which a roof carrier is mounted are sandwiched by the roof carrier main body and sandwiching member. Consequently, at least the portion of the floating brake which is abutting against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted is elastically deformed and attached to the member to which a roof carrier is mounted by pressure. Therefore, the roof carrier does not unnecessarily move relative to the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When a large inertia force in the rearward direction of the vehicle acts on the roof carrier and the load during the rapid acceleration of the vehicle, the member (the roof carrier main body or the sandwiching member) to which the floating brake is mounted presses the first inclined face (portion) towards the rear of the vehicle. The first inclined face gradually approaches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted in the forward direction of the vehicle. (the closer to the front of the vehicle.) Therefore, a portion of the force with which the roof carrier main body or the sandwiching member presses against the first inclined face (portion) is converted into a force with which the floating brake presses against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. Consequently, since the sandwiching force for sandwiching the floating brake and the member to which a roof carrier is mounted is increased, the resistance of the roof carrier to movement is increased, and the amount of movement due to inertia force is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when a large inertia force in the forward direction of the vehicle acts on the roof carrier and the load during the rapid deceleration of the vehicle, the roof carrier main body or the sandwiching member presses the second inclined face (portion) towards the front of the vehicle. The second inclined face gradually approaches the member to which a roof carrier is mounted in the rearward direction of the vehicle. (the closer to the rear of the vehicle.) Therefore, a portion of the force with which the sandwiching member presses against the second inclined portion is converted into a force with which the floating brake presses against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. Consequently, since the sandwiching force for sandwiching the floating brake and the member to which a roof carrier is mounted is increased, the resistance of the roof carrier to movement is increased and the amount of movement due to inertia force is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> By using a floating brake in which at least the portion abutting against the member to which a roof carrier is mounted can be elastically deformed, the floating brake can be elastically deformed and the member to which a roof carrier is mounted reliably sandwiched between the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A third aspect of the present invention is the roof carrier mounting structure according to the second aspect of the present invention, wherein a gap for allowing the floating brake to be relatively movable with respect to the sandwiching member is formed between the floating brake and the sandwiching member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the sandwiching member presses the first inclined portion or the second inclined portion during a rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle, the floating brake is moved toward the member to which a roof carrier is mounted due to a gap formed between the floating brake and the sandwiching member. Thus, the floating brake is moved towards the member to which a roof carrier is mounted so that a sufficiently large sandwiching force can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A fourth aspect of the present invention is the roof carrier mounting structure according to the second aspect or third aspect of the present invention, wherein the sandwiching member includes: a housing portion for housing the floating brake; and an engaging portion provided in the housing portion for engaging with an portion to be engaged provided on the floating brake such that floating brake cannot easily be removed from the housing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, the floating brake is housed in the housing portion provided in the sandwiching member and is attached to the sandwiching member such that the floating brake cannot easily be removed from the housing portion due to the engagement of the engaging portion with the portion to be engaged. Therefore, it is possible to simply perform the assembly of the floating brake in the sandwiching member. During the assembly, moreover, adhering means such as an adhesive is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A fifth aspect of the present invention is the roof carrier mounting structure according to the first aspect of the present invention, wherein the roof carrier includes: a roof carrier main body; a sandwiching member for sandwiching the member to which a roof carrier is mounted between the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member; and a fixing member for fixing the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member so as to be relatively movable in the longitudinal direction when acceleration or deceleration having a predetermined value or more acts in the longitudinal direction; wherein the inclined portion includes: a third inclined face formed on the fixing member for causing the sandwiching member to be moved toward the roof carrier main body when the roof carrier main body is moved in a forward direction of the vehicle with respect to the sandwiching member; and a fourth inclined face formed on the fixing member for causing the sandwiching member to be moved toward the roof carrier main body when the roof carrier main body is moved in a rearward direction of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in normal conditions, that is, when acceleration or deceleration is not acting on the vehicle or when the acceleration or deceleration is acting on the vehicle but has a value equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, there is no relative movement between the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The member to which a roof carrier is mounted is sandwiched by the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member. Therefore, the roof carrier does not move unnecessarily relative to the member to which a roof carrier is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When a large inertia force in the rearward direction of the vehicle acts on the roof carrier and the load during a rapid acceleration of the vehicle so that the roof carrier main body is moved relatively with respect to the sandwiching member in the forward direction of the vehicle, the third inclined face moves the sandwiching member toward the roof carrier main body. Consequently, since the sandwiching force for causing the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member to sandwich the member to which a roof carrier is mounted increases, the resistance of the roof carrier to movement is increased and the amount of movement due to inertia force is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when a large inertia force in the forward direction of the vehicle acts on the roof carrier and the load during the rapid deceleration of the vehicle so that roof carrier main body is moved relatively with respect to the sandwiching member in the rearward direction of the vehicle, the fourth inclined face move the sandwiching member toward the roof carrier main body. Consequently, since the sandwiching force for causing the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member to sandwich the member to which a roof carrier is mounted increases, the resistance of the roof carrier to movement is increased and the amount of movement due to inertia force is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, a portion of the inertia force acting on the load and the roof carrier during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle is utilized to move the sandwiching member toward the roof carrier main body. Therefore, even if the original sandwiching force of the roof carrier main body and the sandwiching member is small, the movement of the load and the roof carrier can be further reduced to a level less than in the prior art during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, the fixing member on which the third inclined face and the fourth inclined face are formed is simply provided enabling the structure to be kept simple.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show the main portions of a roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be mounted by a roof carrier mounting structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an automobile <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> mounted thereon is shown. In the following, as shown in the drawings, the forward direction of a vehicle is indicated by an arrow F, the transverse direction of a vehicle is indicated by an arrow W and the upward direction of a vehicle is indicated by an arrow U. In the following description, &ldquo;forward direction&rdquo;, &ldquo;rearward direction&rdquo;, &ldquo;longitudinal direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;transverse direction&rdquo; mean &ldquo;the forward direction of the vehicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;the rearward direction of the vehicle&rdquo;, &ldquo;the longitudinal direction of the vehicle&rdquo; and &ldquo;the transverse direction of the vehicle&rdquo;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, two parallel roof rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are fixed at both ends in the transverse direction of a roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the automobile <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, running along the longitudinal direction of the vehicle (the direction of the arrow F and a reverse direction thereof). A roof rail leg <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rising obliquely from the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fixed to both ends in the longitudinal direction of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A predetermined space <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is formed between the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Two load bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are provided in parallel with each other between the pair of roof rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The vicinities of both ends of each load bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are fixed to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of roof carriers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In other words, the vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment comprises four roof carriers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. All four roof carriers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have the same structures and the same structured roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used at any mounting position, regardless of left or right, front or rear on the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be mounted to the vicinities of the both ends of the respective load bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed to have an almost box shape, and openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are formed on both faces in the transverse direction and on the bottom face. The portions in the vicinity of both ends of the load bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are inserted in the openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. For example, a loading member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> onto which baggage may be loaded (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the like are fixed between these two load bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided on the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in parallel, and baggage can be loaded on the loading member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Naturally, the baggage can be fixed directly to the load bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an almost trapezoid-shaped notch is formed in an upward direction in a front wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and a rear wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B of the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in an almost central position in the transverse direction in the lower portion of the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which forms a roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is housed in the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A flange <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed, extending in the forward direction from the front wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and in the rearward direction from the rear wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B, in the upper portion of the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is reinforced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided suspended between the front wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and the rear wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B in a position in the vicinity of the inside of the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the transverse direction (the right-hand side position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). A clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotatably attached to the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed in substantially a plate shape so as to cover the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the lower face of the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In addition, the central portion in the transverse direction of the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is partially bent (concaved) downward to form a concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is formed in a shallow V shape (an inverse isosceles triangle shape) when seen from the side of the vehicle, which corresponds to the shape of a floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which will be described below. A forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer towards the front of the vehicle is formed on the forward side of the center (shown by a center line C) in the longitudinal direction. Similarly, a rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer towards the rear of the vehicle is formed on the rearward side of the center in the longitudinal direction. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, B, moreover, the sectional shape in the transverse direction of the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of rubber is housed in the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed to have a shallow V shape (an inverse isosceles triangle shape) which is longitudinally symmetrical using the center line C as the symmetry axis as seen from the side of the vehicle, and a forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle is formed on the forward side of the center in the longitudinal direction. The forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is in contact with the upper face of the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle is formed on the rearward side of the center in the longitudinal direction. The rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is in contact with the upper face of the rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> have a predetermined tilt angle &thgr; with respect to the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The longitudinal length of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is shorter than that of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a predetermined gaps <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) are formed between the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be relatively within moved a constant range in the longitudinal direction of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the vertical direction of the vehicle due to the gap <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a gap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the upper face of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed like a plane, and acts as a contact face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which comes in contact with the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (shown in a two-dot chain line also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the upper portion of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> projects upward from the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the state in which the roof carrier is not mounted on the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the contact face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pressed against the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is elastically compressed in the vertical direction in the state in which the roof carrier is mounted on the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the amount of the projection of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is reduced. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, B</cross-reference>, the sectional shape in the transverse direction of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Both side faces in the transverse direction of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are formed in parallel with each other in the longitudinal direction. A block-shaped engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> projects from each side face. On the other hand, a concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed corresponding to the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on both side faces in the transverse direction of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be housed in the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by elastically deforming the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. After the housing of the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the engaging concave portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has been completed, the engaging-piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are engaged with each other by the elastic restoration of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As described above, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can easily be assembled into the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is not inadvertently separated from the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, an adhesive or the like is not required for the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, moreover, the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a length in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle which is greater than the length in the longitudinal direction of the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by a predetermined amount, and has a height in the vertical direction of the vehicle which is greater than the height in the vertical direction of the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by a predetermined amount. A predetermined gap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed on both left and right sides in the longitudinal direction and in the upper portion between the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and between the upper portion of the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and an upper inner wall of the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the vertical direction of the vehicle. By the gap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can move relatively with respect to the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> within a constant range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a pin <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is rotatably suspended between the front wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and the rear wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B at a position in the vicinity of the outside of the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the transverse direction. A bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> projects outwards in a radial direction from the pin <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A male screw thread is formed on the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the tip thereof, and a nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is screwed onto the male screw thread <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated in the direction in which the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (the direction indicated by the arrow A), and the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is rotated around the pin <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the direction in which the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (the direction indicated by the arrow B), the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be housed inside a housing hole <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) formed in the distal end of the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is supported on both sides in the transverse direction by the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on one side and the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the other (a so-called double-cantilever type) When the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is fastened in this state, the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated by the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow A so that the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is firmly pressed against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pressed in close contact with the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a predetermined fastening force Q (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 5</cross-reference>) between the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, a so-called cantilever type can be used in addition to the above-mentioned double-cantilever type. More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at an outwards position in the transverse direction (towards the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), and the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted in a housing hole formed on the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in a position between the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By fastening the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be caused to come in close contact with the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given of a method for mounting the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present embodiment and the operation of the roof carrier mounting structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In order to mount the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, first of all, the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated in the opposite direction to the arrow A in the state in which the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is not housed in the housing hole <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (shown in a two-dot chain line also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), thereby forming a sufficient gap between the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Next, the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are provided in predetermined positions with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is positioned in the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is positioned in the gap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) between the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, next, the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated in the direction of the arrow A to cause the contact face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to come in contact with the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the bolt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is rotated in the direction of the arrow B and is then housed in the housing hole <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. When the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is gradually screwed tight in this state, the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is pushed upward by the nut <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and is further rotated in the direction of the arrow A. The floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is the elastically deformed and the contact face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is strongly pressed against the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by pressure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 5</cross-reference>, consequently, each fastening force Q which is vertical respectively relative to the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> acts on the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> therefrom. Consequently, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pressed in close contact with the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the roof rail housing portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not move in the longitudinal direction with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When acceleration or deceleration which is equal to or greater than a predetermined value acts on the vehicle, a large inertia force acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the inertia force is smaller than a frictional force acting on the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> due to the above-mentioned fastening force Q, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not move relative to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the inertia force is greater than the frictional force, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> tries to move relative to the vehicle (roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) in the direction of the inertia force. However, in this case, in the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present embodiment, the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the vehicle is less than the same relative movement the conventional roof carrier mounting structure. A detailed description will be given of this point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For example, when a large inertia force acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the forward direction during a large (rapid) deceleration of the vehicle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> try to move inertially in the forward direction as a single body because the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is attached to the casing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> forward pressing force F acts on the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is inclined at the predetermined tilt angle &thgr; with respect to the lower face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be moved in the longitudinal direction with respect to the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the pressing force F is divided into a vertical component F&middot;sin (&thgr;) and a horizontal component F&middot;cos (&thgr;) on the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The vertical component F&middot;sin (&thgr;) acts as force for pressing the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As a result, anew fastening force F&middot;sin (&thgr;) acts in addition to the fastening force Q in the normal state (in which acceleration or deceleration that is equal to or greater than a predetermined value is not acting on the vehicle). Consequently, the whole fastening force becomes larger than the fastening force Q in the normal state as shown by the arrow P in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. For this reason, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is firmly fixed to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Consequently, even if the inertia force acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the amount of forward relative movement for the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the above description, furthermore, the component F&middot;sin (&thgr;) of the pressing force acting as a new fastening force during the rapid deceleration of the vehicle is increased in proportion to the inertia force. More specifically, the greater the inertial force, the greater the overall fastening force. Consequently, the amount of relative movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be reduced effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> While the description has been given by using the rapid deceleration of the vehicle as an example, the rearward inertia force acts as the rearward pressing force F on the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the component F&middot;sin (&thgr;) of the pressing force F which is vertical to the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is applied as the force for pressing the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during rapid acceleration of the vehicle. Consequently, the overall fastening force is larger than the fastening force Q in the normal state, in the same manner as during the rapid deceleration of the vehicle. Thus, the amount of rearward relative movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the fastening torque and the average amount of maximum movement of the roof carrier which are measured by changing the value of the tilt angle &thgr; for the double-cantilever type roof carrier and the cantilever type roof carrier in the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present invention. The &ldquo;average amount of maximum movement&rdquo; represents the average &ldquo;amount of maximum movement&rdquo; for the four roof carriers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> mounted on the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during the rapid deceleration (or the rapid acceleration) of the vehicle. Moreover, the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is at temporary maximum directly after the rapid deceleration of the vehicle. Then, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> slightly returns towards its initial position. Therefore, the amount of relative movement decreases, then the relative movement stops. The term &ldquo;amount of maximum movement&rdquo; represents the amount of relative movement which is at temporary maximum directly after the rapid deceleration of the vehicle. Hereinafter, the term &ldquo;amount of movement&rdquo; will be used to mean the &ldquo;average amount of maximum movement&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment has a structure in which the clamp <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is rotated around the pin <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to fasten the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the axis of abscissa indicates the fastening torque. The fastening torque is proportional to the fastening force for fastening the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the graph, in the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present embodiment, although there is a difference between the amounts of movement in the double-cantilever type and the cantilever type, no matter what type or tilt angle, the amount of movement can be set to 70 mm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the case of the cantilever type, moreover, it is apparent that the amount of movement is the smallest with the tilt angle &thgr;&equals;17&deg; and is sequentially reduced in order of: tilt angle &thgr;&equals;12&deg; and tilt angle &thgr;&equals;22&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce the amount of movement, it is preferable that the condition of the tilt angle &thgr; should have the following range. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>5&deg;&lE;&thgr;&lE;45&deg;&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> More specifically, if &thgr; is equal to or greater than 5&deg;, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can keep a predetermined thickness. Therefore, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently elastically deformed in the direction of that thickness (the vertical direction). Moreover, if &thgr; is set to 45&deg; or less, the vertical component F&middot;sin (&thgr;) mentioned above of the inertia force F is greater than the horizontal component F&middot;cos (&thgr;) mentioned above. Therefore, the effect of increasing the fastening force is greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As matter of course, the tilt angle &thgr; is not restricted to the range of the above-mentioned equation (1). More specifically, the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present embodiment can reduce the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a smaller fastening torque than in the prior art. Therefore, the tilt angle &thgr; can properly be set corresponding to the shape and the location where the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be mounted. For example, by reducing the tilt angle &thgr; and decreasing the thickness of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be mounted to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> even when the gap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the roof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the roof rails <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is narrow but a sufficient fastening force can still be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, the amount of movement differs depending on whether a double-cantilever type or a cantilever type is used and on the value of the tilt angle &thgr;. However, if the type and tilt angle &thgr; are the same, then the changes in the amount of movement during a rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle are little affected by changes in the fastening torque. In other words, almost the same effect can be obtained irrespective of the fastening torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this way, the roof carrier mounting structure according to the first embodiment enables the amount of movement by the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be reduced to less than in the prior art during the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle even when the fastening force (fastening torque) is small. Namely, in a conventional roof carrier mounting structure, after taking into consideration the costs, weight, and ease of mounting, it was found necessary from a structural standpoint (as is shown in by the &Circlesolid; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to increase the fastening torque in order to reduce the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during a rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle (see arrow J on the graph). On the other hand, in the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present embodiment, the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be reduced to less than in the prior art with a small fastening torque (fastening force) as shown by &ldquo;&starf;&rdquo; (the plots on the graph move in the direction shown by the outlined arrow K). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show a roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As compared with the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, this roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses a different structure for assembling the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The same components, members and the like as those in the first embodiment have the same reference numerals and their description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the engaging piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment are not formed in the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Instead, an engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are formed in the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> projects downward from the center in the transverse direction of the bottom edge of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and is formed from a cylinder portion <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> formed in a cylindrical shape and a large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> having a diameter partially increased on a tip (the lower end) of the cylinder portions. A semispherical face <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is formed on the tip side (lower end side) of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and an engaging face <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, perpendicular to the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, is formed on the rear end side (upper end side) of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is formed in a position corresponding to the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, that is, the center in the transverse direction of the lower end of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> such that the longitudinal direction thereof is coincident with the forward-rearward direction of the vehicle. The slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a predetermined width which is smaller than the diameter of the engaging face <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and slightly larger than the diameter of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, when the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is to be assembled in the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is pushed against the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. As the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is gradually pushed in, the semispherical face <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is pressed against the hole wall of the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, namely, the diameter of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is elastically reduced, and the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> passes through the lower face of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by penetrating the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this state, the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> reverts elastically to its previous condition. Therefore, even if a force acts on the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to the direction in which the engaging projection is extracted (upward), the engaging face <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the wall surface (the lower surface of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) around the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> so that the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is not extracted from the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the state in which the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is housed in the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is kept. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In this state, moreover, a predetermined gap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is formed in the longitudinal direction between the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Due to the gap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a gap <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> formed between the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be moved in the longitudinal direction with respect to the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Since the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can thus move in the longitudinal direction, it can move toward and along the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the inclined face of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (a forward inclined face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or a rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) is pushed from the inclined wall of the housing concave portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (a forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or a rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). Consequently, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is firmly pressed against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the pressure so that the fastening force is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In this way, in the roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can easily be assembled with the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> simply by pushing the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against the slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the same manner as in the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, moreover, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pushed more firmly against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and held thereon by utilizing a part of the inertia force acting on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> during the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle. Therefore, the amount of movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> show a roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be directly fixed to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of an automobile to which no roof rail is attached (the automobile body itself is not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). The same components, members and the like as those in the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment have the same reference numerals and their description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a load bar housing portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> open toward the center of the vehicle in the transverse direction is formed in the upper portion of a casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> formed substantially in a box shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. The end of the load bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is housed and held in (fixed to) the load bar housing portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the bottom wall of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> comprises a forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> on the forward side of the center thereof in the longitudinal direction which gradually approaches the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle, and a rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> on the rearward sides of the center thereof in the longitudinal direction which gradually approaches the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle. Moreover, a slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> whose longitudinal direction is aligned in the forward-rearward direction of the vehicle is formed in the center of the bottom wall in the transverse direction of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. An engaging projection <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which will be described below is inserted in the slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A concave housing portion <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is provided below the bottom wall of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and a floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is housed in the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is formed substantially in an inverted shallow V shape (an upright isosceles triangle shape) when seen from the side. The forward inclined face <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the lower face of the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the lower face of the rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. These forward and rearward inclined faces <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> form a predetermined tilt angle &thgr; with the upper face of the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the lower portion of the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> bulges out slightly downwards from the lower end of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). The bottom face of the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is a contact face <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> formed in a planar shape, and the contact face <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in the state in which the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The engaging projection <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> projects upward from the center in the transverse direction of the upper end of the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The engaging projection <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is formed from a cylinder portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> formed in a cylinder shape and a large diameter portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> having a diameter partially increased at a tip (the upper end) thereof in the same manner as the engaging projection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment. A semispherical face <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and an engaging face <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are formed in the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. By that the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is pushed against the slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the lower end of a holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which will be described below, the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> can be inserted in the due to an elastic reduction in the diameter thereof. After the insertion, the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is housed in the projection concave housing portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> formed in the holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and elastically reverts to its original state. Consequently, the engaging face <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> hits the wall face of the projection concave housing portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the engaging projection <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is not inadvertently removed. In this state, moreover, a predetermined gap <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is formed between the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, the slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and projection concave housing portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can be moved in the longitudinal direction with respect to the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> stands upright from the center of the bottom wall of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and is provided inside the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is bolted to the holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> such that its head portion faces outward in the transverse direction (to the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Moreover, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is inserted in an insertion hole <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> formed in the vicinity of the upper end of a clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is formed substantially in a plate shape, and is bent at a predetermined position so as to match the shape of the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In particular, the lower end of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is a hook piece <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> which is bent toward the inside of the vehicle in the transverse direction. The hook piece <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is engaged with the end of the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in the transverse direction thereof. When the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is fastened in the engagement state, the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the hook piece <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the contact face <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Consequently, even if the inertia force F acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the amount of relative movement in the longitudinal direction of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in relation to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> show a roof carrier <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.

In the fourth embodiment, the same components, members and the like as those in the first or third embodiment have the same reference numerals and their description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, the engaging projection <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and the slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment are not formed in the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Instead, an engaging piece <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is formed on the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and an engaging concave portion <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is formed on the side face in the transverse direction of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the first embodiment. A predetermined gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is formed on both sides in the longitudinal direction and in a lower portion thereof between the engaging piece <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the engaging concave portion <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. Due to the gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can be relatively moved within a constant range with respect to the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the roof carrier <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment also, the engaging piece <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> can be housed in the concave engaging portion <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> by elastically deforming the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the roof carrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment.

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> show a roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention. The roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to the seventh embodiment can also be directly mounted on a roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in an automobile of a type having no roof rail attached thereto in the same manner as the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment, and has the same basic structure. The same components, members and the like as those in the third embodiment have the same reference numerals and their description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, an almost flat V-shaped slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> seen from a side face in the transverse direction is formed on a holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> fixed integrally with a casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Since the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is thus V-shaped, a forward inclined face <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> which gradually separates from the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle is formed on the forward side of the center. Similarly, a rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> which gradually separates from the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle is formed on the rearward side of the center. Both the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> are set to form a predetermined tilt angle &thgr; with respect to the upper face of the roof rail <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is inserted in the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be moved in the longitudinal direction along the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. By this movement, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is also moved upward along the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> or the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the upper portion of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is fixed to the head portion of the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> can be relatively moved in the longitudinal direction with respect to the holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> integrally with the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> made of rubber is housed in the lower portion of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is formed substantially in a rectangular shape which is different from the floating brakes according to each of the first to sixth embodiments, and the inclined face according to each of the first to sixth embodiments is not formed. The bottom face of the elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is formed in-a planar shape and acts as a contact face <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>A which comes in contact with the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to the seventh embodiment which has this type of structure, a bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided at the center of the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, that is, in the closest position to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is then elastically deformed in the normal state, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, so that the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is held by a predetermined fastening force Q (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) by means of the contact face <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>A of the elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> and a hook piece <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> During the rapid deceleration of a vehicle, the inertia force of a load tries to move the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the forward direction of the vehicle. However, the inertia force does not directly act on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Therefore, clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is held in a constant position with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> moves relatively to the rearward direction of the vehicle within the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> (this inertia force is represented by F). In this movement, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> tries to move upward along the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and an F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. As a result, a new fastening force F&middot;sin (&thgr;) acts in addition to the fastening force Q in the normal state, and the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state, as shown by an arrow P in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Consequently, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is firmly fixed to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and even if an inertia force is applied, the amount of relative movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. In addition, the more the inertia force acting on the load is increased, the greater becomes the overall fastening force. Therefore, the movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be reduced more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> While the above description has been given by taking the rapid deceleration of the vehicle as an example, in the rapid acceleration of the vehicle, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> moves relatively to the forward direction of the vehicle within the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and the F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state. Consequently, even if the inertia force acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the amount of relative movement with respect to for the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows a roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. The roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> has almost the same structure as the structure of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> according to the seventh embodiment, however, it is different from the roof carrier according to the seventh embodiment in that a bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is fixed so as to be immovable with respect to a holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a substantially planar inverse V-shaped V slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper portion of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The V slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is provided with a forward inclined face <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle from the center thereof and a rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle from the center thereof. The head portion of the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is inserted in the V slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> according to the eighth embodiment, in the normal state, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is fixed such that the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is positioned on the center of the V slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. In this state, an elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed and the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is held with a predetermined fastening force Q by means of between) a contact face <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>A of the elastic member <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> and a hook piece <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> During the rapid deceleration of a vehicle, the inertia force of a load tries to move the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the forward direction of the vehicle. However, because the inertia force does not directly act on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> maintains a constant position with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> moves in the forward direction of the vehicle within the V slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> (this inertia force is represented by F). By this movement, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> hits against the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and the F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the eighth embodiment. As a result, a new fastening force F&middot;sin (&thgr;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) acts in addition to the fastening force Q in the normal state, and the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state. Consequently, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is firmly fixed to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and, even if an inertia force is applied, the amount of relative movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. In addition, the move the inertia force acting on the load is increased, the greater the overall fastening force becomes. Therefore, the movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can be reduced more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> While the above description has been given by taking the rapid deceleration of the vehicle as an example, in the rapid acceleration of the vehicle, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is relatively-moved in the rearward direction of the vehicle within the slit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and the F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state. Consequently, even if the inertia force acts on the roof carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the amount of relative movement for the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the above description, the member forming the V slit is not particularly restricted, and it is sufficient if a portion of the inertia force F is converted into fastening force when the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are relatively moved by the inertia force F during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. If the v slit is formed on the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>) as in the seventh embodiment, the appearance of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be improved because the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is covered by the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and can not seen from the outside. A member (a cover or the like) for covering the slit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is not required so that the number of parts is not increased. On the other hand, in the case where the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, is to be formed as in the eighth embodiment, the effects of the present invention can be obtained by replacing only the clamp of an existing roof carrier with the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> according to the eighth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the slits <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are not restricted to the above-mentioned V shape. For example, the slits <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> may have a substantially elliptical curved shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</cross-reference> show a roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. The roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> according to the ninth embodiment can also be directly mounted on a roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in an automobile of a type having no roof rail fixed thereto in the same manner as the roof carrier <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment, and has the same basic structure. The same components, members and the like have as those in the third embodiment have the same reference numerals and their description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, an inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> formed substantially in a flattened V shape when seen from a side face is provided in a casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> instead of the holding block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment. The inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is rotatably fixed to the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> by means of a spindle <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> formed at one end in the longitudinal direction (on the left side in the drawing). Moreover, a crank type lever <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted to the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at a position opposite to the spindle <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction. The lever <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> supports the free end of the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> from below. By rotating the lever <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> can be moved between the position of upward rotation shown by the solid line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> and the position of downward rotation shown by the one-dot chain line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> A forward inclined face <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> which gradually separates from the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle is formed on the forward side of the vehicle from the center of the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> which gradually separates from the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle is formed on the rearward side of the vehicle from the center of the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> A slot <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is formed in the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. A bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is inserted in the slot <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> with the head portion thereof facing downwards. Moreover, a nut <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> screwed onto the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is in contact with at least one of the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> through an elastic member <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> made of rubber. Consequently, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be moved in the longitudinal direction along the slot <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, but not removed therefrom. When the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is moved in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, an upward movement is carried out along the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> or the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the upper end of the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is fixed to the head portion of the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> according to the ninth embodiment which has the above structure, when the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is to be mounted on the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, a lever <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is first operated such that the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is rotated to the downward position, as shown by the one-dot chain line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. Consequently, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is also moved downward so that a sufficient gap is formed between the elastic member <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> for the mounting operation to be easily performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> After the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> has been disposed such that the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is positioned in the gap between the elastic member <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the lever <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is operated to rotate the inclined wall-like member <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> upward as shown by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. Consequently, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is moved upward so that the gap formed with the elastic member <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is reduced. As a result, the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the elastic member <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> sandwich the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> with a constant fastening force Q. For this reason, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> does not move in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> During the rapid deceleration of a vehicle, the inertia force of the load tries to move the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the forward direction of the vehicle. However, the inertia force does not act directly on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is held in a constant position with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is relatively moved in the rearward direction of the vehicle within the slit <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> (this inertia force is represented by F), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. Due to this movement, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> tries to move upward along the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and the F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. As a result, a new fastening force F&middot;sin (&thgr;) acts in addition to the fastening force Q in the normal state, and the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state, as shown by an arrow P in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. Consequently, the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is firmly fixed to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and even if an inertia force is applied, the amount of relative movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> with respect to the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. In addition, the more the inertia force acting on the load increases, the greater the overall fastening force becomes. Therefore, the movement of the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can be reduced more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> While the above description has been given by taking the rapid deceleration of the vehicle as an example, in the rapid acceleration of the vehicle, the bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> moves relatively in the forward direction of the vehicle within the slit <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and the F&middot;sin (&thgr;) component of the inertia force F which is perpendicular to the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> acts on the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the overall fastening force becomes greater than the fastening force in the normal state, and even if an inertia force is applied to the roof carrier <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, the amount of relative movement of the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the roof carrier mounting structure according to the present invention, a portion of the inertia force acting during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle is utilized to increase the fastening force for pressing the floating brakes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, or the fastening force (interposing force) of the casing <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the clamp <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> for the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the fastening force (fastening torque) in the normal state is set at less than in the prior art, it is possible to reduce the amount of relative movement of the roof carrier with respect to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. By setting the fastening force (fastening torque) small in the normal state, the size and weight of each of the roof carriers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Provided that a portion of the inertia force acting during the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle can be utilized to increase the fastening force (fastening torque), the present invention is not restricted to the above-mentioned structure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, for example, the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be provided with the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer to the front of the vehicle and a forward inclined face <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which gradually approaches the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the closer to the rear of the vehicle. The concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also bulges upward at the center in the longitudinal direction, thereby forming the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, so as to come in contact with the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. With this structure, the roles of the forward inclined face and the rearward inclined face are reversed as compared with the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> having the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and the like. More specifically, the forward inclined face <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pushed from the forward inclined wall <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> during the rapid deceleration of the vehicle, and the rearward inclined face <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pushed from the rearward inclined wall <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the concave housing portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> during the rapid acceleration of the vehicle. However, even in this case, a portion of the inertia force acting during the rapid acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle can be caused to act as fastening force in the same way as the floating brake <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, the floating brake <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the floating brakes <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> having the structures shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also be applied to the roof carrier of the type shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (which can be directly mounted on the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the material of each of the floating brakes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is not restricted to the above-mentioned rubber and any material which can be elastically deformed and pressed (attached) to the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by pressure can be used. For example, it is sufficient if at least the portion which abuts against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed of an elastic material such as a resin having a predetermined elasticity. In this case, portions other than the portion which abuts against the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be formed of a material (metal or the like) having a small elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> If the floating brake is made of a material having a small elasticity, the engaging pieces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the engaging projections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be formed of materials having predetermined elasticity and may be fixed to the floating brake afterwards. More specifically, the predetermined elasticity can be kept for the engaging pieces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and the engaging projections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the floating brake can easily be assembled with the concave housing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> While the coefficient of friction (the magnitude of friction) between the floating brake and the forward inclined walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the rearward inclined walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the floating brake and the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is not particularly restricted, it is preferable that the coefficient of friction of the floating brake and the forward inclined walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> should be smaller than the coefficient of friction of the floating brake and the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the coefficient of friction is thus set so that the floating brake easily slips relatively with respect to the forward inclined walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the rearward inclined walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the floating brake is pushed toward the roof rail <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the roof panel <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> more firmly. Thus, a large fastening force can be obtained. </paragraph>
