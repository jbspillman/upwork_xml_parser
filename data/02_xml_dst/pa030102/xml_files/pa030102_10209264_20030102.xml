Disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns the human hepatitis B virus genome, isolated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and with a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) within the major surface antigen, its nucleotide sequence, the deduced amino acid sequence of the four major proteins, antigen, antibody, detection systems, development of effective vaccines, and antiviral agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> HCC is one of the most common human liver cancers, particularly in Asia where 70% of the worldwide new cases are found every year. It usually arises in cirrhotic livers as a complication of chronic liver disease. The clinical manifestations of HCC patients are unspecific with signs and symptoms only appearing in the later stages of the cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the major causes of chronic liver diseases is hepatitis B viral infection. First discovered in 1963 as a human virus that is transmitted parenterally, chronic hepatitis B viral infection has been most commonly implicated in serological undefined pathogenesis of HCC. Despite the fact that hepatitis B virus does not display features of a complete viral oncogene, its involvement in the development of HCC can be attributed to various aspects of its interaction with host hepatocyte cells. These include the promiscuous transcriptional activity of the smallest viral protein, X, which enhances the expression level of many cellular target genes including proto-oncogenes. On the other hand, integrated viral DNA in the host chromosomes is regularly found in HCC patients. There is also evidence for an active role in the development of HCC by the major surface antigen. This protein has served as the main detection marker for carriers of hepatitis B virus. The most antigenic epitope is a highly conserved region spanning 23 amino acid residues and located from amino acid position 124 to 147 of the major surface antigen. This small region designated as the group specific determinant &ldquo;a&rdquo; is found in all subtypes and isolates of hepatitis B viral genomes. Its antigenic properties seem due to its proposed double loop structure, to which the vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody binds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Our epidemiological data indicate that the wild type major surface antigen has been found in most HCC patients. Furthermore, observation indicates that several variants of the major surface antigen from HCC patients may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Direct sequencing analysis indicated that 24 out of 63 HCC patients (around 38%) carry various mutations in the &ldquo;a&rdquo; epitope of the major surface antigen. When both the wild type and variant cases are combined, the proportion of the variant virus carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133, located in the first loop of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; epitope of the major surface antigen (Methionine to Threonine), is as high as 12.7% in 63 HCC patients from the Southeast Asia region, and present in 5 local HCC cases. However, the same mutation is found in only 2% of hepatitis B virus carriers in a random population (more than 100 cases). The significance of this variant at amino acid residue 133 is further strengthened by the fact that the proportion of variant virus at amino acid residue 145 (Glycine to Arginine), better known as a vaccine-induced mutant and located in the second loop of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; epitope, remains constant at 8% in hepatitis B virus carriers in the random population sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although this variant hepatitis B viral strain, carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen in HCC patients, may arise differently from those induced following vaccination (i.e. with a mutation at amino acid residue 145 of the major surface antigen), this strain shares similar characteristics in that both are stable and cases of vertical transmission of these strains have been reported, despite effective hepatitis B virus prophylaxis and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The emergence of the variant human hepatitis B virus, carrying mutations in the &ldquo;a&rdquo; epitope of the major surface antigen, in HCC is of concern. The high proportion of the mutant virus with a substitution at amino acid residue 133 of the major surface antigen is of particular interest as it may point to a close association with the pathogenesis of HCC. This correlation would therefore require the urgent development of specific detection systems as well as effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines and antiviral agents. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of this mutant virus constitutes the first step towards these aims and will certainly be helpful for developing the above-mentioned diagnostic and treatment schemes. </paragraph>

The present invention also concerns such nucleotide changes which code for proteins reported in this invention. It is equally well known that one or more amino acids in a protein sequence can be replaced by other analogous amino acids, as defined by their hydrophilic properties or charges, to produce an analog of the amino acid sequence. Any analogs of the proteins of the present invention involving amino acid replacement, deletions, isosteres (modified amino acids that bear close structural and spatial similarity to protein amino acids), or additions, can be utilized, provided that the resulting sequences elicit antibodies recognizing hepatitis B virus from HCC with a mutation at amino acid is mutation 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> 1. Isolation of Viral DNA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The viral DNA was isolated from a serum sample (5194) obtained from a 63-year old Chinese female patient of surface antigen carrier. She was confirmed as an HCC patient by biopsy. The hepatitis B virus from her serum carried a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) in the major surface antigen, as shown by our previous sequencing analysis o; the &ldquo;a&rdquo; epitope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The isolation method used was: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 200 &mgr;l of the serum sample was added with 400 &mgr;1 of the lysis buffer (Tris chloride 10 mM, pH7.4, EDTA 1 mM, and sodium dodecyl sulfate 2%) and 25 &mgr;l of proteinase K (20 mg/ml), incubated at 65&deg; C. for 3 hours. Viral DNA was then extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 2. Amplification of Viral DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The virus genome in the present invention was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 3 sets of overlapping oligonucleotides, which were designed according to the wild type hepatitis B virus. Various restriction enzyme sites were included to facilitate the cloning of the PCR products. The position of these oligonucleotides is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and indicated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Flag 1 (AT<highlight><uline>AAGCTT</uline></highlight>ATGCCCCTATCTTATCAACACTTCCGGA) (SEQ. I.D. No. 6) starts at the initiation site of the coding region of DNA polymerase, at position 2307 of the viral nucleotide sequence and matches the coding strand (sense oligonucleotide). An additional HindIII restriction enzyme site is underlined; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Xba3 (GAG<highlight><uline>TCTAGA</uline></highlight>CTCTGCGGTATTGTGA) (SEQ. I.D.

An additional XbaI restriction enzyme site is underlined; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Common 3 (TGA<highlight><uline>GAATTC</uline></highlight>TCACGGTGGTCTCCATGCGACGT) (SEQ. I.D. No. 9) starts at the stop codon of the DNA polymerase, at position 1623. of the viral nucleotide sequence and matches the complementary strand (anti-sense oligonucleotide). An additional EcoRI restriction enzyme site is underlined; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> V11 (TTTGTTTACGTCCCGT) (SEQ. I.D. No. 10) starts near the initiation site of the X gene, at position 1420 of the viral nucleotide sequence and matches the coding strand (sense oligonucleotide); </paragraph>

An additional Hind III restriction enzyme site is underlined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Using viral DNA as template, PCR was then carried out on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer. Cetus) for 35 cycles using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, U.S.A.), each cycle consisting of 1.5 minutes at a denaturing temperature of 94&deg; C., 2 minutes at an annealing temperature of 53&deg; C. and 4 minutes at an extension temperature of 72&deg; C. The following combinations of oligonucleotides were used: Flag1/Xba3, Xba5/Common3 and V11/HindIIIADW3, and generated amplification products of 1.2 kb, 1.4 kb and 1.1 kb respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> 3. Cloning of the Amplified Viral DNA Fragments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The amplified viral DNA fragment from Flag1/Xba3 (1.2 kb) was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion by HindIII and XbaI, prior to cloning in a BlueScript plasmid pre-treated by the same restriction enzymes. Similar digestion with XbaI and EcoRI was applied to PCR product from Xba5/Common3 (1.4 kb), prior to cloning in a BlueScript plasmid pre-treated by XbaI and EcoRI. On the other hand, the DNA fragment amplified with V11 and HindIIIADW3 (1.1 kb) was directly cloned into a ZeroBlunt plasmid, developed by InvitroGen (U.S.A.) for cloning blunt-end DNA fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> 4. Determination of Nucleotide Sequence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequence of the human hepatitis B virus isolated from HCC and reported in the present invention was determined on plasmid DNA template by chain-terminating inhibitors, using the Sequenase DNA Sequencing Kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). To facilitate the sequencing procedure, various internal oligonucleotides were designed (from V1 to V16) according to the wild type hepatitis B virus, and their positions are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> From the analysis described above, the full-length nucleotide sequence of the hepatitis B virus, isolated from HCC and carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen, was determined as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The deduced amino acid sequences coding for the major viral proteins are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>: hepatitis B viral DNA polymerase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the large surface antigen, including the middle and major surface antigen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), the core protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and the trans-activating X protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Alignment of the virus sequence in the present invention with other hepatitis B viral sequences, available in the Genbank database, will point to specific sequence differences which in turn can be used to design DNA probes. A detection system using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can then be developed. Such PCR reactions will involve combinations of oligonucleotides specific to human hepatitis B virus in the present invention, with a mutation at the amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen, thereby allowing highly specific detection of these mutant viral DNA. Briefly, viral DNA can be extracted as described in this invention. PCR reaction can be performed using specific oligonucleotides using the similar cycling conditions described above. Results can then be analyzed after resolving PCR products on a 1% agarose gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> According to known immunological procedures, it is possible to determine epitopes from protein sequences as those in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Determination of these epitopes specific to human hepatitis B virus, from HCC and carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen, will allow synthesis of peptides using known genetic engineering methods, synthesis of proteins, production of antibodies specific to these epitopes, development of specific diagnostic reagents, development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, and antiviral agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> A detection system for antibody against hepatitis B virus isolated from HCC and carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen can be developed using polyvinyl microtiter plates and the sandwich method. Briefly, 50 &mgr;l of 5 &mgr;g/ml concentration of a peptide from the hepatitis B virus in the present invention, isolated from HCC and carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major. surface antigen, can be dispensed in each well of the microtiter plates and incubated overnight at room temperature for consolidation. A similar procedure can be applied to a protein purified from host cells such as Escherichia coli. The microplate wells can be washed five times with physiological saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20. For overcoating, 100 &mgr;l of NaCl buffer containing 30% (v/v) of calf serum and 0.05% Tween 20 (CS buffer) can be dispensed in each well and discarded after incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> To determine antibodies specific for the mutant (Methionine to Threonine at amino acid residue 133 of the major surface antigen) hepatitis B virus in serum, the primary reaction can be carried out such that 50 &mgr;l of the CS buffer and 10 &mgr;l of a serum sample can be dispensed in each microplate well and incubated on a microplate vibrator for one hour at room temperature. After completion of the primary reaction, microplate wells are washed five times as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In the secondary reaction, 1 ng of horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-human IgG mouse monoclonal antibodies dissolved in 50 &mgr;l of calf serum can be dispensed in each microplate well and incubated on a microplate vibrator for one hour at room temperature. Upon completion, wells can be washed five times in the same way. After addition of hydrogen peroxide (as substrate) and 50 &mgr;l of O-phenylenediamine solution (as color developer) in each well, and after incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, 50 &mgr;l of 4M sulphuric acid solution can be dispensed in each well to stop further color development and for reading absorbance at 490 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The present invention makes possible detection of the mutant human hepatitis B virus, in particular those carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen. The present invention also provides detection systems capable of a highly specific and sensitive detection at an early stage of infection or development of HCC when the HCC may be treated and cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In addition, these features allow accurate diagnosis of patients at an early stage in the HCC and also help to inhibit with higher efficiency mutant hepatitis B virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Proteins and their antibodies under the present invention can be utilized for development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, as well as, immunological pharmaceuticals. Sequence information on structural genes of these mutant viruses will be helpful for developing detection systems of the relevant protein antigens and antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Antigen-antibody complexes can be detected by known methods. Specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be raised by immunizing animals such as mice and rabbits with peptides or proteins specific to mutant hepatitis B viruses from HCC. Inhibitory antiviral agents can be designed and targeted against these proteins and molecules in cell culture or in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on studies on human hepatitis virus genome isolated from HCC and carrying a mutation at amino acid residue 133 (Methionine to Threonine) of the major surface antigen. The invention makes possible highly specific detection of these mutant hepatitis B virus from HCC, and provides material such as protein, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for development of such detection system. </paragraph>
