<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Methods and apparatus are provided for making an optically readable media unreadable and tamper-resistant. A method is disclosed for making an optically readable media unreadable, as is a media that operates in accordance with the method. The method has steps of (a) providing the media with a readout surface layer that is non-flat (i.e., textured in some way, such as by embossing, scratching, depositing a non-planar layer or regions, such as droplets) and that inhibits optical readout of the media; (b) applying a coating layer to the non-flat surface layer to smooth the non-flat surface and to enable optical readout of the media; and, after an initiation of a readout period, (c) removing the coating layer so as to expose the non-flat readout surface layer, thereby inhibiting optical readout of the media. Preferably, the coating layer is substantially index matched to the readout surface layer. In one embodiment the step of removing includes a step of evaporating at least one component material of the coating layer, while in another embodiment the step of removing includes a step of subliming at least one component material of the coating layer. A method is also disclosed for discouraging tampering with a readout-limiting mechanism of an optically readable media, as is a media that is constructed so as to operate in accordance with the method. In this embodiment the method has steps of: (a) providing the media with at least one layer that embodies the readout-limiting mechanism; (b) providing a textured surface that forms part of a layer that underlies the at least one layer, where the textured surface inhibits optical readout of the media; and (c) applying a coating layer over the textured surface to smooth the textured surface and to enable optical readout of the media, wherein removal of the coating layer exposes the textured surface thereby inhibiting optical readout of the media. The disk can be packaged in a sealed container with a source of an agent that inhibits transport of a volatile species from the color forming layer or from a layer that sublimates, wherein the onset of the limited play period coincides with the opening of the container. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to optically readable data storage media and, more particularly, to techniques to render said media unreadable after being read at least once. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is often desirable when distributing software or other information, such as music and films, that is recorded on a medium to insure that only one party is enabled to access the recorded information. For example, a company that sells computer software will find it advantageous to enable only the purchaser to read the software from a disk and transfer or install the software to computer memory, such as a hard disk, while preventing subsequent access by other parties to the software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It would also be advantageous when renting content on an optical media, such as a DVD or a CD, to provide only a limited amount of time during which the content can be viewed or otherwise accessed, and to then prohibit further viewing or access (referred to herein as a limited-play mechanism). In this manner the person renting the media need not return the media, as after the limited amount of time expires the media becomes unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Successful readout of an optical disk by all current disk readers heavily relies on a number of parameters that characterize the readout laser beam on its path from the laser to the reflective data layer of the disk and back to the optical pickup system of the reader. The electromagnetic wave structure of the readout beam is described by intensity, phase, polarization, and wave vectors of the wave components that constitute the readout beam. The wave structure of the beam determines geometrical and propagation parameters of the beam, such as beam size, angle of incidence, and angle of convergence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition to reading the data layer of a disk, the reader performs other functions, which are as critical for playability as the data readout itself. These functions include auto-focusing, auto-tracking and error correction. The first two functions allow the reader device to actively control motion of the laser head and spindle motor in order to maintain the required position of the beam relative to the disk. Therefore, maintaining the integrity of the wave structure of the beam throughout its path inside the disk material is a key not only to the successful detection and decoding of the information carried by the beam, but also for the continuity of the readout process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,484 discloses an optical disk having a reflective metallic layer with a plurality of data structures (provided in the form of pits and lands) and a reactive compound superimposed over at least some of the data structures. The reactive compound is a photochromic compound which changes from an optically transparent condition to an optically opaque condition when subjected to readout light and/or atmospheric oxygen. When the compound becomes opaque it prevents readout light from being detected by the readout apparatus, thereby effectively rendering the optical disk unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A significant perceived disadvantage of this approach is that manufacturing, processing and storage of the disks would require an oxygen-free environment. In addition, the coating materials should be degassed to an oxygen-free state and maintained in this condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another disadvantage is that most of the chemical moieties described have poor light fastness, which would allow a limited play disk to be photobleached and converted to a permanent play disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in some cases it may be possible to remove a layer of the photochromic compound, thereby defeating the purpose of providing same on the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In general, the unauthorized removal of a layer on the media in an attempt to defeat the limited-play mechanism, and thus extend the useful life of the media, is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Reference may also be had to commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,772 for disclosing the use of a barrier layer, the removal of which initiates the action of a reading-inhibit agent to prevent machine reading of information encoding features on an optical disk. The reading-inhibit agent may also be activated by exposure to optical radiation, or by rotation of the disk. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a first object and advantage of this invention to provide an improved system and method to render an optically readable media, such as, but not limited to, a laser disk, a compact disk (CD), or a digital video disk (DVD), unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a second object and advantage of this invention to provide an improved system and method to render an optically readable media permanently unreadable, after having been read at least once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is a third object and advantage of this invention to provide an improved system and method to prevent or discourage tampering with a layer intended to limit the useful life of the optically readable media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is still another object and advantage of this invention to provide a mechanism that relies on evaporation of a substance for modifying the optical properties of an optically readable media so as to render the media optically unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is still another object and advantage of this invention to provide a mechanism that relies on sublimation of a substance for modifying the optical properties of an optically readable media so as to render the media optically unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is another object and advantage of this invention to provide a technique that increases optical scattering from a surface or layer of an optically readable media so as to render the media optically unreadable, and/or to defeat an attempt to remove a limited-play mechanism of the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is another object and advantage of this invention to provide a mechanism that alters a surface characteristic of an optically readable media so as to detrimentally affect a readout apparatus tracking process during an attempted readout of the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is a further object and advantage of this invention to provide a mechanism that causes surface topography changes to an optically readable media so as to detrimentally affect a readout apparatus feedback and tracking process, thereby adversely affecting the fidelity of the readout. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other problems are overcome and the objects and the advantages of the invention are realized by methods and apparatus in accordance with embodiments of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A method is disclosed for making an optically readable media unreadable, as is a media that operates in accordance with the method. The method has steps of (a) providing the media with a readout surface layer that is non-flat (i.e., textured in some way, such as by embossing, scratching, depositing a non-planar layer or regions, such as droplets) and that inhibits optical readout of the media; (b) applying a coating layer to the non-flat surface layer to smooth the non-flat surface and to enable optical readout of the media; and, after an initiation of a readout period, (c) reducing a thickness of the coating layer so as to expose the non-flat readout surface layer, thereby inhibiting optical readout of the media. Preferably, the coating layer is substantially index matched to the readout surface layer. In one embodiment the step of reducing the thickness includes a step of evaporation or sublimation of at least one component material of the coating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with these teachings a method is disclosed for discouraging tampering with a readout-limiting mechanism of an optically readable media, as is a media that is constructed so as to operate in accordance with the method. In this embodiment the method has steps of: (a) providing the media with at least one layer that embodies the readout-limiting mechanism; (b) providing a textured surface that forms part of a layer that underlies the at least one layer, where the textured surface inhibits optical readout of the media; and (c) applying at least one coating layer over the textured surface to smooth the textured surface and to enable optical readout of the media, wherein removal of the coating layer exposes the textured surface thereby inhibiting optical readout of the media. The readout-limiting mechanism can include a layer that changes from an optically transparent state to a state that inhibits successful readout of data structures located on the media or, more generally, a layer that changes from a first state that enables successful readout of data structures located on the media to a second state that inhibits successful readout of data structures located on the media. The readout-limiting mechanism can function as well as one of the coating layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned change to the second state from the first state can be induced by an increase in optical absorption and/or by an increase or a change in mechanical stress in a layer or layers, and/or by an increase in optical scattering, and/or by evaporation of a volatile compound, and/or by sublimation of a volatile compound. A volatile compound or material as employed herein is one that is capable of supporting or participating in a material transport driven by a concentration gradient between the material and a surrounding medium, examples of which are evaporation and sublimation. Stated differently, a volatile compound or material is one that is capable of losing mass through a transport mechanism to a surrounding medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of this invention an optically readable media is constructed to include a surface region that encodes information that is optically readable by a reading device and a transparent readout surface layer that contains localized regions each containing a volatile compound having an index of refraction at the readout light wavelength that is closely matched to the material of the surrounding readout surface layer. The localized regions are responsive to an initiation of a readout period for losing at least some of the volatile compound, such as by evaporation or sublimation, for creating voids within the transparent readout surface layer. The presence of the voids increases the optical scattering and thereby inhibits optical readout of the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in the embodiments that employ surface roughness or voids, that the optical transmission through the layer can be essentially unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In various ones of the embodiments of this invention a barrier layer can be provided to protect and to inhibit or regulate the loss of the volatile substance to the surrounding medium, effectively isolating a layer containing the volatile substance from the surrounding medium. The barrier layer could be provided as a peel-off layer for isolating the volatile substance from the surrounding medium at least until it is desired to use the media in the readout device. The media can be packaged in a sealed container, such as a plastic bag, that contains a source of the volatile compound, thereby inhibiting loss of the volatile compound from the media until the media is removed from the container and exposed to the surrounding medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The limited play disk is preferably packaged in a sealed container with a source of an agent that inhibits transport of a volatile species from the color forming layer or from a layer that sublimates, wherein the onset of the limited play period coincides with the opening of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the foregoing and other various aspects of the teachings of this invention may be implemented alone or in combination to achieve the purposes set forth herein.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic diagram of an optical scanning system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for reading an optically readable disk that incorporates one or more features of the present invention. Although the present invention will be described with reference to the embodiments shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many forms of alternative embodiments. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of materials or elements could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It should further be noted at the outset that as employed herein an &ldquo;optically encoded&rdquo; or &ldquo;optically readable&rdquo; media or medium is intended to cover a number of various devices wherein data (such as a computer program), audio (such as music) and/or video (such as a film), collectively referred to herein simply as information or content, is stored such that it can be readout when a lightbeam (either visible light or invisible light) is applied to the medium. Such a medium can include, but is not limited to, laser disks, compact disks (CDs), CD-ROMs, and digital video or versatile disks (DVDs), as well as certain kinds of tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In general, the media of interest to this invention incorporates some type of mechanism that is capable of altering an optical property of the light, for example, the wavefront, optical noise content, intensity and/or wave emission wavelength. Also, the reflectance and/or transmission property of the media can be changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By rendering the media &ldquo;unreadable&rdquo; it should be understood that it is not necessary to make the entire media unreadable. For example, it may be necessary to make only a relatively small portion of a boot record or a directory of contents unreadable such that the entire media becomes unusable or unreadable, or such that some predetermined portion of the media becomes unusable or unreadable. Making the media unreadable may also imply adversely affecting a readout device optical feedback and tracking process. By example, readout laser focus adjustments may not be able to react quickly enough to a modified surface profile of the media, resulting in an inability to maintain the correct tracking. This has been found to manifest itself as &ldquo;skipping&rdquo; through a music segment of a compact disk, or to otherwise negatively impact the fidelity of the output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The optical scanning system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which may be conventional in construction, generally comprises a disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an optical scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally adapted to move an optically readable disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as a CD-ROM, relative to the optical scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the optical scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located below the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for scanning a lower surface of the disk, though in other embodiments the scanning head may located to scan an upper surface of the disk. The scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably held by a movable carriage or arm (not shown) so that the head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be moved relative to a center of the disk. For example, the scanning head may be able to translate radially relative to the center of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or circumferentially around the center of the disk. In alternate embodiments, the optical scanning head may be fixedly held relative to the center of the optically readable disk. As the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves over the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the head reads optically readable data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) disposed on the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a disk support or chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operably connects the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, when energized the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotates the chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises appropriate holding means (not shown) to stably hold the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereon when the chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is rotated by the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adapted to rotate the chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> held thereon at predetermined speeds. The motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may operate to rotate the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a variable rotational velocity so that the disk presents a reading surface to the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which moves at a constant linear velocity. For example, as the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is radially translated closer to the center of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the chuck <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> spins the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at an increasing rotational velocity. Thus, the portion of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passing over the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moving at a constant linear velocity. It is noted that in conventional laser disks, the data structure is generally disposed in a single track spiralling from the edge of the disk towards the center which requires that the disk spin at a variable rate of rotation in order for the track to move at a constant linear speed relative to the scanning head. By way of example, the disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may rotate a DVD at an appropriately increasing rate of rotation to provide a linear velocity of about 3.5 m/sec over the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally includes a light source <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a photodetector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generates and directs an incident or interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of electromagnetic radiation (also referred to herein as optical radiation) against the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a reflective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed thereon or therein. The interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of electromagnetic radiation directed against the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then detected by then photodetector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the optical scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the disk drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> relative to the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> passes over the data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the reflective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the disk. As the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> moves over the data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the data structures modulate the reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The modulation in the reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is registered at the photodetector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and converted to electrical signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> More particularly, and by way of example, the light source <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may include a laser diode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or other such suitable device for generating the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of optical radiation. The beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generated by the laser diode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be directed through a quarter wave plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and through polarizing beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the positions of the wave plate and beam splitter may be reversed so that the beam passes first through the beam splitter and then through the wave plate. Also, the beam generated by the laser diode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be collimated by a collimator (not shown) before encountering the wave plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. After the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> passes through the beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the beam encounters an appropriate lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which focuses the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a predetermined focal point. The interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> emitted by the light source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may have a wavelength of about 650 nm, although the beam may have other wavelengths. The interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be focused to a spot size of approximately 0.63 um. The depth of focus of the beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is about 0.9 um, though this depth may be adjusted as required. The interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is modulated by an appropriate modulator (such as an acousto-optic or electro-optic modulator, not shown) to effect a residence time per bit of between about 100-200 nsec. The laser diode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is otherwise adapted to deliver approximately 1 mW of power on the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The energy deposited per bit by the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is about 200 pJ and the fluence of the beam on the focus spot is about 50 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, the intensity of the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the focus spot is about 300 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In alternate embodiments, the light source may have any other suitable configuration to generate an interrogating beam of electromagnetic radiation having appropriate characteristics for reading data structures from an optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the reflective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the laser disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed between an upper protective layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a lower layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The reflective layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be comprised of metal, such as aluminum, though other suitable materials may be used, which is formed by appropriate means to provide a reflecting surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As mentioned previously, the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is encoded with information stored as data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are adapted to change the reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> when the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is incident on features of the data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. For example, the data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may comprise a pattern of lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed in the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are raised portions on the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the optical disk. The pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are depressed portions (relative to the lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the individual pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may have a width of about 0.4 um and a length of between about 0.4-1.9 um, though the pits may have any other suitable length and width. In alternate embodiments, the data structures formed in the reflective surface of the optical disk may have any other suitable features which change a quality of the reflected beam when the interrogating beam encounters these features. By way of example such features may be sequences of scarified and reflective surfaces or through holes in the reflective surface of the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generated by the light source <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is focused by the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> such that the focal point is located at the &lsquo;bottom&rsquo; surface of the pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is incident on the surface of a pit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is reflected by the pit surface as a reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The reflected beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passes through the lens <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (now acting as a collimator for the reflected beam) and is then deflected by the beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to strike the photodetector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the scanning head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is instead directed at a land <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a lesser amount of the beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is reflected back to be detected by the photodetector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This is because the surface of the land <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is located at a different depth then the focal depth of the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generated by the light source may be focused by the lens at the surface of the lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and not the pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In either case, it can be appreciated that the change in reflectivity between two states (corresponding to whether the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is incident on a pit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or on a land <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), provides a mechanism to encode binary data (i.e., ones and zeroes) into the surface of the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereafter assuming that the interrogating beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is focused at the surface of the pits <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the reflective surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, though the teachings of this invention are equally applicable to the case where the interrogating beam is instead focused at the surface of the lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to include a layer or coating <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A of a reactive compound that evaporates over time. In the preferred embodiments the coating <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A includes a dye, such as a lactone dye, having a cation with strong light absorbance properties around 650 nm, a currently preferred wavelength for the readout laser. A polymer material or some other material can be used to provide an acidic environment for causing a controlled ring opening of the lactione dye, and which can be cross-linked or otherwise modified to form a relatively inert or inactive coating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Lactone dyes are generally colorless so long as the lactone moiety remains intact. However, by modifying the environment, for example by lowering the pH and/or by changing the micropolarity, the lactone ring is cleaved and the intensely colored cationic form of the dye is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the color-forming coating <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A includes at least three components: (1) a dye, such as a lactone type dye; (2) acidic sites; and (3) a solvent, such as an amine or amide-based solvent. The acidic sites may be provided by a polymer, a clay, or by any other acidic substrate. When the components are combined, the amine or amide-based solvent serves to stabilize the lactone dye to the colorless form. When the amide or amine-based solvent evaporates, the lactone group reacts with the acidic sites and undergoes a ring opening to generate a highly colored substance with a strong absorption at the wavelength currently used to read DVD and CD disks (i.e., about 650 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In greater detail, the colorless lactone shown in the reaction scheme shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is protonated by an acid. Each nitrogen is shown with its free electron pair. The protonated lactone undergoes a ring opening to produce the colored compound, in this case, blue, which is in a quininoid form. The electron pairs on the two nitrogens with the ethyl groups are directly involved with the ring opening of the protonated lactone, thereby producing the colored compound in a quininoid form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The functioning of this color changing system is based on a four component equilibrium. The equilibrium is between the colorless lactone form, the colored quininoid form, and the number of acidic and basic sites associated with the permanent and the volatile components of the color changing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In general, the rate of color change is dependent on the type of solvent and its boiling point. By selecting an appropriate solvent, complete color formation can occur within a range of a few minutes to several hours to even longer times (days). Moreover, the final maximum absorbance at the readout wavelength can be modified over a range of absorbances by changing the lactone moiety to acidic site ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of this invention the polymer provides a basic environment while the evaporating solvent has an acidic nature. In this case the color change occurs when the system transitions from acidic to basic due to evaporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;undyed&rdquo; state of the disk may be maintained by storing the disk in a way that prevents the solvent from evaporating, described in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with an embodiment of these teachings an amino-phthalide dye in a 4-vinylphenol polymer (av. MW 8,000) was cross-linked in the presence of formaldehyde. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the optical absorbance of this system when coated on a glass plate, and exposed to normal room conditions for 21 hours. The vertical bar represents the absorbance at 650 nm. In other embodiments the crosslinking may be controlled in incremental steps, as the level of cross-linking was found to effect the lactone ring opening. It may further be desirable to employ a phenolformaldehyde resin system with the formaldehyde functionality already chemically linked to the polymer, in order to avoid the use of free formaldehyde. Analogues may also be synthesized with solubility properties tailored to the polymer formulations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In any of these embodiments the coating <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A may be applied by a spin coating procedure. As an example, for the amino-phthalide dye in the 4-vinylphenol polymer embodiment a layer thickness equal to or less than about one micrometer was found to be optimum, and DVD readability was found to be disabled when the absorbance at 650 nm was equal to or greater than about 0.5. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A solution was prepared of 1 g poly(4-vinylphenol) (MW&equals;8,000) in 10 ml ethanol, 2 ml N,N-dirnethylformamide and 200 mg of 3-&lsqb;2,2-bis(4-diethylarninophenyl)vinyl)-6-dimethylaminophthalide. Glass slides, DVD and CD disks were coated with this formulation to produce a 500-700 nm thick layer. The coating was dried at 60-70 degrees C. for a few minutes, which caused the generation of an intensely blue colored dye. This blue dye was transformed back to its colorless state by exposing the slides or disks to a controlled atmosphere of an amine or amide based solvent (e.g., fonnamides, acetamides, pyrrolidinones). The colorless state was maintained when these slides and disks remained sealed in polyester or polypropylene bags along with an absorbent medium, such as filter paper, that contained a few drops of the corresponding solvent. Upon removal from the bag, color formation occurred again. Depending on the boiling point of the used solvent, the color formation could be timed. For example, with the formulation described in this example, and by using 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as a solvent, a maximum absorbance of 0.7 at 650 nm was achieved after about six hours at room temperature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Modification of the polymer to lactone ratio was found to control the maximum achievable absorbance at 650 nm. It is important not to just increase the concentration of lactone groups, but to also adjust the number of acidic sites available to the lactone moiety. When glass slides and disks were coated with a formulation of 1.5 g poly(4-vinylphenol) (MW&equals;8,000), 10 ml ethanol, 2 ml N,N-dimethylformamide and 300 rng of 3-&lsqb;2,2-bis(4-diethylarninophenyl)vinyl)-6-dimethylaminophthalide, a maximum absorbance of 1.7 at 650 nm was obtained after about six hours at room temperature. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If high boiling amine or amide-based solvents are used; e.g., b.p.&gt;100&deg; C., the solvent can be added directly to the formulation and exposure of the coating to a controlled solvent atmosphere can be omitted. For example, when slides or disks were coated with a formulation of 1 g poly(4-vinylphenol) (MW&equals;8000), 10 ml ethanol, 2 ml 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and 200 mg of 3-&lsqb;2,2-bis(4-diethylaminophenyl)vinyl&rsqb;-6-dimethylaminophthalide, and then dried for 5 minutes at 50&deg; C., a slightly tacky colorless layer was obtained. The color change to blue occurred at the same rate and to the same level of absorbance as described in Example 1 of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of these teachings is a mechanism to control the process by which the color change occurs, and hence the duration of the readable state of the optical media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> graph is depicted that plots media readability time (in hours) versus a thickness of a top barrier layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) that is placed over the color-forming layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. An increase in the thickness of the top barrier layer can be seen to increase the amount of time that the media remains in the readable state, as transport of the volatile substance (e.g., the evaporating solvent) through the barrier layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is slowed. The thickness of the barrier layer can also be used to control the readability time of the embodiments, described below, that employ sublimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As a further control over the time that the media remains in the playable state, and referring also to Fig., <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the color-changing layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be biased with a chromophore selected to absorb at the desired wavelength, e.g., at about 650 nm. By causing the layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to exhibit some amount of absorption that is less than the maximum amount of absorption that is tolerated before the media become unreadable (the readability threshold), the time required for the media to decrease the transmission of the layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to the readability threshold, due to the evaporative mechanism, is reduced. The use of the bias chromophore can also be advantageous to insure that the transmission of the color changing layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> will not asymptotically approach the readability threshold, without actually crossing it. It should be noted that the readability threshold may vary from reader to reader due to differences in laser output, detector sensitivity, and other factors. The use of the biasing chromophore can thus be advantageous to insure that all media will become unreadable in all readers within approximately the same amount of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> One suitable biasing chromophore for a disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> used with a reader employing a 650 nm readout wavelength is a dye known as 3-Diethylyamino-7-diethyliminophenoxazonium perchlorate, or Oxazine 725, which has an absorbance maximum at 646 nm in ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As a further aspect of this invention, composite and multi-player (multi-wavelength) coatings can be employed as an additional feature. Such multi-wavelength coatings provide absorption maxima at two or more wavelengths that coincide with possible readout light wavelengths, e.g., 630 nm and 780 nm for CDs, 630 nm and 650 nm for DVDs, and to also accommodate future higher density readout wavelengths at 440 nm. The multi-wavelength coating can also be used to absorb a specific wavelength and a range of wavelengths, such as 635 nm and the range of 750 nm to 800 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As a further aspect of this invention, texturing of a surface layer of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be employed to defeat an attempt to chemically or otherwise remove the readout wavelength absorbing coating., weaken its adhesion to the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or otherwise tamper with it. A goal of this aspect of the invention is to make a removal of the color forming polymer result in a non-flat (textured) read-out surface of the disk, rendering it permanently unreadable. This mechanism preferably relies on an introduction of optical noise beyond the correction limit of the disk readout device, or beyond an ability of the tracking mechanism to compensate, or on a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> This aspect of the invention may be implemented using several approaches. One approach is to produce a surface texture on the read-out side of a disk by patterning the original disk material as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> on path A. This can be accomplished by, as examples only, embossing, engraving or scratching the original disk material. Another method of producing a textured surface is to unevenly deposit, such as by spraying, a chemically resistant, strongly adherent and optically transparent material on the original surface, as shown on path B, making the disk unreadable (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). A next step applies one or several additional coatings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B over the textured (non-flat) surface, one of which may be the color-forming coating and another of which may be a protective coating (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). It is desired to match or substantially match the index of refraction of the coating to the underlying textured (non-flat) surface of the layer so as to produce a smooth playable surface. Any or all of the layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B applied above the textured surface may have texture smoothing functionality (e.g., filling the &ldquo;valleys&rdquo; of the underlying texture to a degree acceptable for playability). The color forming coating may fill or partially fill the underlying surface defects and/or textures to render the optical disk readable. If the color forming coating only partially fills the underlying surface defects and/or textures, then the protective coating layer or layers fill the remainder </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in one presently preferred embodiment processing begins with the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as one coming from the conventional disk production line (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A). In step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B the readout surface is textured by depositing an optically clear, chemically resistant material. This forms textures or structures <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment this step sprays an optical adhesive (Norland NOA73) onto the disk surface, and then UV cures the adhesive. The end result is the formation of the three dimensional features or structures <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> having a diameter of about 200 micrometers and a height of about 250 nm. At the end of this step the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is unreadable. In step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is applied to provide the limited play function as well as to smooth the surface texture. Preferably the coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is applied by spin-coating a layer comprised of the lactone dye/solvent system described above. As is shown, the thickness of the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be less than the height of structures <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (e.g., less than about 250 nm), although in other embodiments the thickness of the color forming layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may equal or exceed the height of the structures <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. For example, the thickness of the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be about 800 nm. The color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may include the biasing chromophore discussed above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. It is also within the scope of this invention to include one or more taggants within the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (and/or within another layer), such as preselected phosphors that emit predetermined wavelengths when illuminated by excitation light. The taggants enable the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or at least the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to be subsequently identified as to place of origin, or to identify a manufacturing batch, etc. Preferably the selected taggant(s) do not interfere with the normal readout process to any significant degree. In step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D the barrier coating <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is applied to protect the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and to control the material loss rate from the color forming coating, as was discussed above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Preferably the barrier coating <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is also applied by spin-coating, and is comprised of a UV-curable polymer that includes a UV-A compound to absorb incident UV light. The thickness of the barrier coating <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can be in the range of about 7 micrometers to about 25 micrometers, although thinner or thicker film thicknesses can be used. After being applied the barrier coating layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is UV cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the readability degrades until the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes unreadable due to the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> turning opaque, substantially opaque, or until it simply blocks a sufficient amount of light so that the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is no longer readable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this regard it should be noted that it is not necessary in this embodiment, or in any of the other embodiments of this invention that employ the color forming coating, for the coating to be become optically opaque, as the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may become unreadable or unplayable well before a state or condition of optical opacity is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with these teachings, dissolving or otherwise removing part or all of the color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> exposes the three dimensional structures <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the textured surface, with the result being that the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remains or becomes unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of this invention is to produce a single composite coating as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> along path C. In this aspect, parts of the read-out surface of a disk surface are coated with the color forming (CF) material and the remainder of the surface area is coated with a chemically resistant transparent material (TM). Dissolving the color forming portion of the composite coating leaves the disk surface textured and therefore renders the disk permanently unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As was stated above, the successful readout of an optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by current disk readers heavily relies on a number of parameters that characterize the readout laser beam on its path from the laser to the reflective data layer of the disk and back to the optical pickup system of the reader. The electromagnetic wave structure of the readout beam is described by intensity, phase, polarization, temporal pattern and wave vectors of the wave components that constitute the readout beam. The wave structure of the beam determines geometrical and propagation parameters of the beam, such as beam size, angle of incidence, and angle of convergence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the integrity of the readout beam is compromised by optically inhomogeneous or non-uniform disk material, in accordance with an aspect of these teachings, the playability of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be impeded due to failure in any of the three beam functions: data readout (error correction), auto-focusing, and auto-tracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this aspect of these teachings a limited-play mechanism for the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is based on a transformation of a reactive surface layer of the readout side of a disk, which results in modification of the surface parameters of the layer, such as flatness and roughness. The transformation can be induced by physical and/or chemical processes. Physical processes include evaporation or sublimation of a coating substance, as well as material loss resulting in a change in a concentration gradient of a component initially present in the layer. The component can be lost into the surrounding medium by means of, by example, diffusion and desorption. Chemical processes include chemical reactions induced by light, by loss of a component initially present in the layer, or by absorption of a component from the surrounding medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> One specific case of such a transformation of the surface layer results in a bending or warping of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (flatness of the surface is adversely affected), which renders the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. This can be implemented, for example, by coating the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with two different layers, at least one of which is reactive, with the different layers having non-matching expansion coefficients or elastic constants. The transformation in this case results in disk warp (e.g., a &ldquo;bimetallic plate&rdquo; effect). Another specific case of the transformation of the surface layer results in surface topography formation (surface corrugation, optical roughness of the surface is affected) which renders the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. This can be implemented, for example, by coating the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a reactive layer in which the transformation induces elastic stress in excess of the tensile strength of the layer material. This results in multiple ruptures and fragmentation of the coating layer and, therefore, a significant optical roughness of the surface, which makes the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable due at least to increased scattering of the readout light without significantly changing the transmission of the coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of these teachings involves surface topography formation due to evaporation of a solvent, which non-uniformly modifies the surface tension of the layer material, resulting in increased surface roughness (Marangoni effect) and increased optical scattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In these embodiments an increase or change in mechanical stress in at least one layer results in the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becoming optically unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> One example of a reactive compound suitable for such an application is a chemical moiety that undergoes cis-trans isomerization, such as modified azo-benzene, when exposed to spatially non-uniform light (radiance), such as that developed in the readout beam. The transformation of this compound from the trans to the cis configuration is accompanied by a volume change which, in the geometry of a layered coating, results in a generation of elastic stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method for rendering the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable includes the steps of: a) providing the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with at least one layer which undergoes surface deformation in the presence of a stimulus, such as a transport of a volatile constituent compound to the surrounding medium, as can be caused by evaporation or sublimation of the constituent compound; and b) selectively removing the volatile constituent compound from the layer to the surrounding medium for inducing a deformation in a surface of the layer. The surface deformation thus induced during the play process, or more generally during the period during which successful readout of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is possible, causes an aberration in the beam, which may prevent focusing of the beam at desired locations on the features of the data structures <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> during readout. This results in a general failure to readout the data on the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during the readout process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion of an optically readable media <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a surface topography that is modified from a planar profile, and which can be used to detrimentally affect the tracking operation of the readout device further in accordance with the teachings of this invention. In this embodiment the planar surface topography is modified to the non-planar (or non-flat) surface topography (not shown to scale) by the use of a photoresponsive polymer, or through one of an evaporative technique or a sublimation technique, or by providing a surface layer that interacts with a substance in the atmosphere, such as oxygen, water vapor, or carbon dioxide. In these cases it is not necessary to modify the transparency of the surface layer to the readout beam, such as by increasing its radiation absorbing properties through a color change. Instead, the varying surface topography, and its deviation from the expected planar surface layer topography, is sufficient to detrimentally affect the operation of the readout device, such as the tracking operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> show two dimensional topographic measurement reports of disks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the reports being generated using a WYKO Optical Interferometric Profiler. The measurement reports generated by the profiler show the topographic surface relief of a sample. The left hand side panel of each report shows a top-view map of the surface area of the sample. The topographical height in this map is represented by a greyscale image, where darker areas represent valleys and lighter areas represent peaks. The actual lateral dimensions of the scanned area are shown along the axes of the map. The map also contains cross hairs which denote the lines of cross-section of the relief. In the right hand side of each report, &ldquo;X-Profile&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y-Profile&rdquo; graphs show side-views of the cross-section by the horizontal and vertical cross hairs, respectively. These side view profiles provide quantitative information about the topography of the surface relief height, as well as lateral dimensions of the surface features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> were obtained for three different stages of processing of a disk. An initial stage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, is a virgin disk, in this case a DVD, as it comes out of a replication line. An intermediate stage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, is a disk or DVD with a rough, highly chemically resistant coating layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> applied, such as the three dimensional surface features <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. At this stage the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not readable. The report from this stage provides a specific example of topography that makes disks non-readable. The final stage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, is a disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> applied on top of the rough coating layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. This coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can include the color forming layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as well as the barrier layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</cross-reference>. At this point the surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sufficiently smooth again to return the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a readable condition, and the smoothness is comparable to the initial state, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which can be seen from the corresponding reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> An attempt to tamper with the readout inhibiting mechanism, such as by removing the top, smoothing protective coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, thus results in exposure of the underlying rough coating layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, thereby rendering the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It was noted that the smoothing, protective coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include the color formation layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, as was described previously. In this case removing the color formation layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> results directly in exposure of the underlying textured (non-flat) surface of layer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, thereby rendering the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with these teachings, and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the sublimation of an index matching surface layer is used to expose an underlying textured or rough (non-flat) surface layer, rendering an optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. At step B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10 a</cross-reference> surface texture is produced on the read-out side of a disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by patterning the original disk material, such as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> on path A. This can be accomplished by, as examples only, embossing, engraving, injection molding the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to have a texture, chemically or mechanically etching, or by simply scratching the original disk material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Another method of producing a textured surface, as was described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, is by unevenly depositing or by spraying on a (preferably) chemically resistant, strongly adherent and optically transparent material on the original surface, as shown on path B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, making the disk unreadable. In this case, and by example, the surface could be made non-flat by placing droplets of the desired material on the disk surface, and allowing the droplets to dry or cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A next step C applies at least one sublimation coating <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and, optionally, another coating <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A which permits the volatile compound of the sublimation coating <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to pass through. The optional coating <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A may thus function as a protective coating, as well as a coating that controls the rate of sublimation and, thence, the playable lifetime of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The result of applying the layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is that a smooth, playable surface is provided for the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as the underlying non-flat surface has been planarized by the sublimation coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Applying the (optional) protective barrier layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A is shown generally at step D, which also represents packaging the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in an airtight package containing a sufficient amount of the sublimating species to enable a two way transport. At step E it is assumed that the package is opened, thereby starting the playability period, and step F shows the result of the sublimation process after it has progressed to a point where the sublimating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is essentially totally removed. This exposes the underlying rough or textured surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, rendering the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. It should be noted that a sufficient degree of surface roughness may be achieved to prevent playability long before the entire sublimation (smoothing) layer has been lost to the surrounding medium, depending on the height and/or depth of the features provided on the non-flat surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate that a colorless, transparent solid may sublime at a rate that would be useful for rendering an optical disk (e.g., a DVD) unreadable, adamantane (Mp.&equals;261-271 degrees C.) was pressed into a round metal container with a surface area of 0.785 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In this way the sublimation would be from the surface of the adamantane only. The weight loss due to sublimation at room temperature was determined by weighing the container at various times and subtracting the weight obtained from the original weight. This data, and a graph of the data, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that the rate of sublimation is quite linear with time, and in this case had a value of 0.516 mg/hr/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Assuming this rate of sublimation it can be shown that a layer of adamantane would lose thickness at a rate of 0.48 microns per hour. In other words, a layer of adamantane that is five microns thick, coated over a textured (non-flat) surface of an optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as described above, would sublime and expose the textured surface in about 10 hours, thereafter rendering the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> unreadable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent a premature loss of material by evaporation or by sublimation into the free volume of the optical disk packaging material, a barrier (which could be opaque or substantially so) in the form of a peel-off sheet can be affixed to the read-out surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The barrier is one that is impenetrable to the volatile component or components that are placed on the read-out surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g., such as the above mentioned adamantane in the sublimation embodiment or the above mentioned solvents in the evaporation embodiments). The volatile component(s) may be those used in the anti-tampering embodiments of this invention, or in the readable lifetime-limiting embodiments. In any event, the barrier in the form of the peel-off sheet serves to inhibit transport, such as by evaporation or sublimation, until removed prior to use of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, step D). Removal of the peel-off sheet (barrier layer) after opening the disk package serves to enable the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be read, as well as initiating the limited play mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates a sealed container or package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, such as a foil or a plastic bag, that is suitable for practicing an aspect of the invention. The package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> contains one or more of the disks <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a carrier or source <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of a color blocking agent (CBA). The carrier <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> retains the CBA and gradually releases it into the package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in the gaseous state. The CBA is delivered to the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of diffusive transport, where it interacts with the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to maintain the disk in a machine-readable state. This process continues until equilibrium is achieved between the CBA gas and the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, from which point the disk remains in a machine-readable state until the package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The CBA may be a solid, a liquid or a gas. Examples or release mechanisms include evaporation, sublimation and diffusion through a membrane. The carrier <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the CBA can be implemented as a patch or swab of material with a developed surface (e.g., fibrous or porous), or a CBA-absorbing material, such as a polymer. The CBA release kinetics can be adjusted through various parameters of the carrier <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, such as size and position in the package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> relative to the disk, and/or through porosity or permeability. For the evaporative embodiments, the CBA could be the same solvent that forms a part of the color forming coating layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), or for the sublimating embodiments the CBA could be the same sublimating compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Opening of the package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> results in rapid loss of the CBA from the package, as well as depletion of the CBA carrier <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The equilibrium between the CBA gas and the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then permanently sifted towards decreasing CBA concentration, which corresponds to the onset of the limited-play time. As such, triggering of the limited-play mechanism coincides with the opening of the package <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In any of the foregoing embodiments it is within the scope of this invention to provide the further protective transparent coating (e.g., the barrier coating <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>) to improve the robustness of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For those embodiments that interact with the surrounding medium (e.g., those that sublime, or evaporate, or that absorb atmospheric water vapor, etc.), the protective layer is constructed so as not to prevent this action. As was described previously with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the protective barrier layer could be employed to adjust the duration of the period during which the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remains readable, such as by limiting transport through the barrier layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to some predetermined maximum rate. For example, the protective layer may be comprised of the UV-curable polymer that is applied by a spin-coating procedure and then UV-cured to harden it. The protective layer polymer material preferably comprises a silicone-based material. It may also comprise epoxy-based constituent(s). The protective coating layer, as well as the underlying index matching, non-flat surface smoothing layer and/or the color-change evaporation layer can be applied to the optical disk by a spraying technique, as well as by spinning-on, or by placing the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into an atmosphere that is saturated with the desired constituents, and letting the desired constituents condense onto the readout-surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments of this invention the material that comprises the readout-inhibiting layer can include a lactone dye, such as crystal violet lactone, poly-p-(hydroxystyrene), ethanol, N-methyl pyrrolidinone and ammonia and formaldehyde, or the layer can comprise cellulose acetate butyrate, ethyl acetate, silica gel, and benzyl alcohol, or the layer can comprise a salt of a volatile amine, a non-volatile acid component and a lactone dye or a pH indicator dye, or the layer can comprise a water damp polymer film containing a pH indicator dye, wherein during storage the layer is exposed to an atmosphere of a gas whose water solution is one of acidic or basic, and wherein upon removal from storage a volatile gas evaporates from the water damp film, and the pH changes causing a color change in the pH indicator dye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated that a number of embodiments of the teachings of this invention have been described herein, and it should be further appreciated that the teachings of this invention are not intended to be read in a limiting sense to encompass only these described embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> For example, in a further embodiment of this invention one need not provide a substantially uniform coating or layer of a material capable of evaporation or sublimation on the readout-surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In accordance with this example, and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has applied thereto a transparent layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B that contains localized regions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C of a volatile material. The regions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C could be provided in any suitable way, such as by mixing or adding into the liquid phase of the transparent layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B, prior to spraying or spin-coating, small particles of the volatile material. A protective coating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>D can be applied over the layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B. In this embodiment of the invention the material of the layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B is assumed to be substantially index matched to the volatile material of the regions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C, and the readout process proceeds in a normal fashion. However, after the material of the regions <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C partially or completely evaporates or sublimes, through the protective coating <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>D if present, the resulting voids are no longer index matched or substantially index matched to the surrounding matrix of the transparent layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B. In this case the optical scattering increases due to the presence of the voids, and the readability of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is degraded and compromised, which is the desired result, and need not significantly change the transmission of the layer. Preferably the readout beam profile is disturbed, and the optical noise is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) may be employed in a further embodiment, wherein the PDLC is poled and assumed to be in a bistable state. In this case thermal effects due to the readout laser beam are used to destabilize the oriented state of the PDLC, resulting in a the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becoming unreadable. It is also within the scope of these teachings to replace the liquid crystal material with a sublimating or evaporating agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the multiple-wavelength embodiments that were disclosed above it is within the scope of these teachings to incorporate multiple chromophores for biasing the color forming coating for each of the wavelengths of interest. Further in this regard, the biasing chromophore(s) can be located in the color forming layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and/or in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and/or in a third layer. Also, for the multiple-wavelength embodiment a single color forming coating <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be used, or multiple color forming coatings <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can be applied, one for each wavelength of interest. Note that the multiple color forming coatings need not be placed one above another, but could instead be placed in the same plane at different locations on the readout surface of the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It can further be appreciated that as aspect of this invention is a method for setting a duration of the limited play period of the optical disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</cross-reference>, the method includes steps of constructing the disk <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to include at least one limited play region (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) that contains a volatile compound, the limited play region operating by volatile compound transport that is driven by a concentration gradient between the region and a surrounding medium; and adjusting the duration of the limited play period by setting a thickness of the transport barrier layer (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A) that overlies the region. The step of adjusting can include a further step of adding a bias chromophore in combination with the color forming layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in the limited play region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> It should thus be apparent that various alternatives and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments of this invention may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the teachings of this invention. Accordingly, the teachings herein are intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
