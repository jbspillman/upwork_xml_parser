<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a fuel vapor emission system, and more particularly to a fuel vapor emission system suitable for a fuel injection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical fuel injection system for an internal combustion engine has a fuel tank, a low-pressure fuel pump, a fuel vapor separator, a high-pressure fuel pump, a fuel injector and an injection control device. The low-pressure fuel pump delivers a fuel from the fuel tank to the fuel vapor separator through a first delivery passage under a relatively low pressure. The high pressure fuel pump, in turn, delivers the fuel that has been delivered to the vapor separator further to the fuel injector through a second delivery passage under a relatively high pressure. The fuel injector sprays the fuel into an air induction system of the engine or directly to a combustion chamber of the engine, under control of the injection control device. Excess fuel returns to the vapor seperator through a return passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The vapor separator is installed in this system for separating fuel vapors, which can be produced in the first delivery passage, from the liquid fuel. Without such a vapor separator, the vapors can mixed with the sprayed fuel and vary an air/fuel ratio thereof, despite the operation of the fuel injection control device, thus causing undesirable or poor engine performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The fuel vapors accumulate in a space defined above the liquid fuel within the vapor separator. Conventionally, a vent is provided atop the vapor seperator and this vent is normally coupled with a plenum chamber of the air induction system so as to introduce the vapors into the combustion chamber with the air to be burned therein. In some engines, the vent is connected to an exhaust manifold of an exhaust system so as to bumn off the fuel vapors by the heat of exhaust gases. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,103 discloses such conventional arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A problem arises when an engine is restarted immediately after a relatively long period of operation, and in particular, continuous high speed and/or high load operation. During such operation, not only the engine, but peripheral devices and units including the vapor separator, absorb or generate intense heat therein. That is, with regard to the vapor separator, a temperature of the liquid fuel rises and hence the fuel becomes likely to produce a large amount of fuel vapors that accumulate in the space above the liquid fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When the engine is restarted under such circumstances, the high-pressure fuel pump supplies the fuel to the fuel injector and excess fuel, which has been pressurized by the high-pressure fuel pump, returns to the vapor separator. The return fuel is, thus, abruptly depressurized on its way to the vapor separator and expedites the production of the fuel vapors in the vapor separator. The higher the temperature of the return fuel, the more vapors are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If the vent of the vapor separator is directly connected to the air induction system as noted above, the vapors will be added onto a fuel charge that has been measured by the injection control device and shifts the air/fuel ratio to a rich side. This shift of the air/fuel ratio, for example, causes an engine stall and makes it difficult to start the engine again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Some of the foregoing arrangements in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,103, therefore, include a fuel vapor reduction canister in a vapor path that couples the vapor separator with the air induction system. The canister is, however, a relatively costly and cumbersome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A need therefore exists for an improved fuel vapor emission system that can remove vapors from a vapor separator so as to prevent an engine from stalling or causing other undesirable performance without the need for a canister or other special devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another need also exists for an improved fuel vapor system that can remove heat from excess fuel before returning to a vapor separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A marine propulsion system such as an outboard motor can of course employ the foregoing engine. Outboard motors normally includes a drive unit having an engine and a bracket assembly that is mounted on an associated watercraft. The drive unit is coupled to the bracket assembly for pivotal movement about a tilt axis so that the drive unit is tiltable relative to the watercraft. Because of this peculiar nature of the outboard motor, another problem arises with the engine disposed on the drive unit. That is, with the pivotal movement of the drive unit, the engine also pivots and the liquid fuel in the vapor separator can close the vent provided atop thereof. The vapors under this condition, therefore, cannot flow out from the vapor separator, or the liquid fuel itself, rather than the vapors, may flow out to the air induction system. Both of these situations apparently give rise to undesirable engine performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A need therefore exists for an improved fuel vapor emission system that allows vapors in a vapor separator to flow reliably escape and/or prevent liquid fuel from flowing out. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> employs an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a fuel vapor emission system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) arranged in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Although the present invention is shown in the context of an engine for an outboard motor, various aspects and features of the present invention also can be employed with engines for other types of marine outboard drive units (e.g., a stern drive unit) and also with other types of engines (e.g., land vehicle engines and stationary engines). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a bracket assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The bracket assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> supports the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on a transom <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of an associated watercraft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so as to place a marine propulsion device in a submerged position with the watercraft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> resting on the surface of a body of water.

The clamping bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes a pair of bracket arms spaced apart from each other and affixed to the transom <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> completes a hinge coupling between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends through the bracket aims so that the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> supports the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement about a generally horizontally extending tilt axis of the pivot pin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, a hydraulic tilt and trim adjustment system is provided between the swivel bracket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to tilt up and down and also for the trim adjustment of the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used through this description, the terms &ldquo;fore,&rdquo; &ldquo;front,&rdquo; forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;forwardly&rdquo; mean at or to the side where the clamping bracket <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is located, and the terms &ldquo;aft,&rdquo; &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; and &ldquo;rearwardly&rdquo; mean at or to the opposite side of the front side, unless indicated otherwise or otherwise readily apparent from the context of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a power head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, a driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The power head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is disposed atop the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and includes the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a top cowling member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The protective cowling assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> generally completely surrounds the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to enclose it in a closed cavity. The top cowling member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is detachably affixed to the bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with a conventional coupling mechanism so that the operator can access the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for maintenance or for other purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the top cowling member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has an air intake opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> disposed on its rear and top portion. A pair of air intake ducts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is provided at a position adjacent to the intake opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so that ambient air enter the closed cavity through the opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the intake ducts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has an opening at its bottom portion through which an upper portion of an exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extends. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is affixed atop the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The bottom cowling member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, thus, generally fonn a tray. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is placed onto this tray and is affixed to the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so as to be supported thereby. The exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also has an exhaust passage therein, through which a burnt charge (e.g., exhaust gases) from the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is discharged as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment operates on a four-stroke combustion principle and powers a propulsion device. The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> defines four cylinder bores which extend generally horizontally and which are spaced generally vertically apart from each other. That is, the engine <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a horizontal cylinder, L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (in-line four cylinder) type. This type of engine, however, is merely exemplary of a type on which various aspect and features of the present invention can be used. Engines having other number of cylinders, having other cylinder arrangements, and operating on other combustion principles (e.g., crankcase compression two-stroke or rotary) are all practicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>, a piston <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> reciprocates in each cylinder bore <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is affixed to one end of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> defines four combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> with the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The other end of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is closed with a crankcase member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that defines a crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> with the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically through the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is rotatably connected to the respective pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by connecting rods <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and thus rotates with the reciprocal movement of the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Counter weights <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are provided on the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> oppositely to the connecting rods <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so as to effectively provide balance with the total weight of the other side including combustion power received by the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The crankcase member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is located at the forward-most position. The cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> extend rearwardly from the crankcase member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> one after another. The major engine components <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> preferably are made of aluminum alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> introduces the air from the closed cavity of the cowling assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> comprises four intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, four air intake passages <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a single plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and are opened and closed by intake valves <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. When each intake port <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is opened, the corresponding intake passage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> communicates with the associated combustion chamber <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is defined within a plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is made of plastic material or aluminum alloy and mounted on the port side of the crankcase member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. The plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> has an air inlet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that communicates to the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> functions as an intake silencer and a collector of air charges. The air intake passages <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> connect the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The air intake passages <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extend rearwardly from the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> along the port side surface of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and then bend toward the intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the air intake passages <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are defined by intake runners <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which are made of aluminum alloy. In the illustrated embodiment, the intake runners <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are unified with the plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The intake runners <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> connect the plenum chamber member <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to the throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, while the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> connect the throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> communicates with the intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via passages defined in the throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The respective throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> support throttle valves <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> disposed therein for pivotal movement about axes of valve shafts <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> which extend generally vertically. The valve shafts <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are linked together to form a single valve shaft that passes through each of the throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The throttle valves <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are operable by the operator through a suitable throttle cable and a linkage mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the operator operates the throttle cable, the linkage mechanism activates the valve shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to open the throttle valves <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for adjusting an amount of air passing therethrough. Conversely, when the throttle cable is released, the linkage mechanism moves the valve shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to close the throttle valves <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an exhaust system. The exhaust system discharges the burnt charge (e.g., exhaust gases) outside of the outboard motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Exhaust ports <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are defined in the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and are opened and closed by exhaust valves <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. When the exhaust ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are opened, the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> communicate with exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> defined within the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> communicates with the exhaust passage defined by the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An intake camshaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and an exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extend generally vertically within an intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and an exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, respectively. A camshaft cover member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> defines the separate cam chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> with the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The intake cam shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is provided to activate the intake valves <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, while the exhaust cam shaft <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is provided to activate the exhaust valves <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The respective camshafts <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> have cam lobes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to push the intake and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> at predetermined timings to open and close the intake and exhaust ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The camshafts <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> are journaled on the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> with camshaft caps and are driven by the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The respective camshafts <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> have sprockets <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> fitted thereon, and the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also has a sprocket <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> fitted thereon. A cogged belt or timing chain <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is wound around the sprockets <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. With rotation of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the camshafts <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> also rotate. A tensioner (not shown) is provided to adjust the tension of the belt or chain <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> by pushing it inwardly so as to keep accurate opening and closing timings of the intake and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a fuel injection system <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, although other conventional fuel supply and charge forming systems such as carburetors can be used for supplying fuel for combustion in the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The fuel injection system <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> includes four fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> which have injection nozzles directed toward the respective intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> spray fuel into the intake ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> under a control of an ECU (Electronic Control Unit), which is not shown. More specifically, the ECU controls a fuel amount and a timing of each injection. The fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are supported by a fuel rail <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> that is affixed to the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fuel supply system <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> further includes a fuel supply tank <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that is provided in the hull of the associated watercraft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and contains fuel that will be sprayed by the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Fuel is drawn from the fuel tank <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> through a fuel supply passage <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> by a low pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which supplies the fuel to a fuel reservoir or fuel vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The low-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is operated by the cam lobe <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and thus provides a relatively low pressure. A fuel filter <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is positioned in the fuel passage <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to remove alien substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is generally disposed at a space <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> defined between the port side surface of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and is affixed to the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. A float valve <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is provided at the end of the, passage <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and is operated by a float <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> so as to maintain a uniform level of the fuel in the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. A high pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is provided within the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and pressurizes the fuel that is delivered to the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> through a fuel delivery passage <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> which includes the fuel rail <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. The high-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is an electric pump that is driven by an electric motor and develops a pressure greater than the pressure developed by the low-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, i.e., the cam-operated pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A fuel return passage <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> connects a portion of the fuel delivery passage <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to return excess fuel thereto. A pressure regulator <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is positioned in this passage <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> atop the fuel rail <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and limits the pressure that is delivered to the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to a preset and fixed magnitude by dumping the fuel back to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> when the pressure in the fuel rail <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is greater than the preset magnitude. Because the pressure regulator <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> keeps the pressure at this constant magnitude, the ECU can measure or meter the amount of fuel sprayed by controlling the duration of each injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The fuel return passage <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> further includes a heat exchanger or cooler <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically along the fuel rail <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and is affixed to the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> with a flange <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by bolts <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via a heat insulator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. A water passage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as well as the return passage <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> passes through a body of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The water passage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> extends along the return passage <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and in close proximity thereto. The water flowing through the water passage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, thus, efficiently removes the heat in the return fuel. Accordingly, the fuel that has returned to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> has been cooled and thus releases less vapor upon returning to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. A water cooling system which supplies water to the passage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will be described below in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Because the flange <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is affixed to the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> via the heat insulator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the transfer of heat accumulated in the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the return fuel is attenuated. The intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> themselves are further cooled by air flowing therethrough. This arrangement thus further enhances heat reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Additionally, surfaces of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and devices and units including the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and the various conduits disposed within the closed cavity of the cowling assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are also cooled by the air introduced into the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The fuel level of the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is limited by the float valve <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> as noted above, thus maintaining a space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is defined above the fuel in the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Fuel vapors accumulate in this space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> because vapors are lighter than the liquid fuel. The fuel vapors are, thus, separated from the liquid fuel in the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The fuel vapor emission system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is coupled with this space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and its construction is described in more detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although not specifically shown, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also includes an ignition or firing system. Four spark plugs (not shown) are mounted on the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so as to expose electrodes to the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The spark plugs fire air/fuel charges in the respective combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> according to an appropriate ignition timing scheme. The ignition timing is also controlled by the ECU. As noted above, such an air/fuel charge is formed with the air supplied by the air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the fuel sprayed by the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the fuel injection system <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is affixed atop the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a generator for supplying electric power to the firing system, the ECU and other electrical equipment directly and/or via a battery. The battery (not shown) is normally disposed in the hull of the watercraft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A protector <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> covers the flywheel assembly <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, sprockets <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the belt <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for protection of the operator from such moving parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes also a lubrication system <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. A lubricant reservoir or oil pan <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> depends from the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> into the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and contains lubricant oil. An oil pump <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is coupled to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or one of the camshafts <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> so as to be driven thereby. The lubricant in the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is drawn by the oil pump <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and delivered to engine portions that benefit from lubrication. An oil strainer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is provided at an outlet port in the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> so as to remove alien substances from the lubricant oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Such engine portions include, for example, crankshaft bearing portions, the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that reciprocate within the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and camshaft bearing portions. Although normally the lubricant oil that lubricates the camshaft bearing portions is separately delivered, the lubricant oil that lubricates the crankshaft bearing portions and the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is delivered through a common lubricant passage. That is, the lubricant oil is at first delivered to the crankshaft bearing portions through a lubricant path formed internally of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> itself and then part of the lubricant oil is further delivered to the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> through a lubricant path formed within the connecting rods <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Lubrication aids in preventing the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> from seizing on surfaces of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. One or more through-holes are made at each skirt portion of the piston <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and hence the lubricant can flow out to the outer surface of the piston <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which slides along the surface of the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Piston rings are provided on and around the pistons <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> primarily to isolate the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> from the crankcase chambers <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. At least one piston ring, which is normally placed at the lowermost position, can move the lubricant from the surface of the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and move it to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After lubricating the various engine components, most of the lubricant returns to the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> through a drain port <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and a drain passage <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> extending from the port <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The lubricant that has returned to the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is recycled so as to lubricate the engine portions repeatedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Some of the lubricant, however, adheres on the engine components and internal walls of the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the camshaft chambers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> rather than returning to the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. This remaining lubricant vaporizes when the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is heated through continuous operation and these lubricant vapors can fill the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the camshaft chambers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In addition, unburnt charges containing a small amount of the exhaust gas can leak to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> from the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> as &ldquo;blow-by gas&rdquo; due to the expansion pressures generated therein, despite the effects of the piston rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In order to remove the oil vapors and the blow-by gases from these chambers <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment has a ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. This ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> bums the oil vapors and the blow-by gases, in the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> includes an inner ventilation passage <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, an oil separator or breather <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and an outer ventilation passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the camshaft chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> define part of the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, both the camshaft chambers <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are connected by an inter-camshaft chamber passage <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> defined within the camshaft cover member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The inner ventilation passage <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is defined internally of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to connect the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> with the intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is coupled with the exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> via the inter-camshaft, passage <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> communicates with the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> separates liquid oil components from the oil vapors by guiding the vapors to flow through a labyrinth structure defined therein. Thus, the oil seperator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is an oil vapor separator that separates the oil vapors from the liquid oil components. Because the blow-by gases also contain oil components, these oil components are also separated by the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is defined in a camshaft cover member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so as to be unified with the exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The oil vapors and the blow-by gases which have no liquid oil components proceed to the outer ventilation passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, while the liquid components drop down to a drain (not shown) that communicates with the drain passage <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and return back to the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The outer passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> couples the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> with a ventilation inlet port <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> of the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> so as to deliver the oil vapors and blow-by gases to the induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the outer passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> extends along the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the starboard side, and more specifically, generally along the top periphery of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further includes a water cooling system that provides cooling water or coolant to engine portions, for example, the cylinder body <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the cylinder head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and also to the exhaust system, so as to dissipate or remove heat generated during engine operation. The cooling system is described below in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment has a number of engine related devices that are mounted onto the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or provided adjacently to the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, a starter motor, a relay box and a fuse box are mounted on or provided around the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, although they are not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> depends from the power head <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and supports a driveshaft <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> which is driven by the crankshaft <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. An upper portion of the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> surrounds the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is generally &ldquo;doughnutshaped&rdquo; or &ldquo;toroidal&rdquo;. The driveshaft <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> extends generally vertically through the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and then extends through the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in front of the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also defines internal passages which form portions of the exhaust system. In the illustrated embodiment, an exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> depends from the exhaust guide member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and extends downwardly through a center hollow of the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. An upper portion of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> communicates with the exhaust passage disposed therein. An exhaust expansion chamber <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> depends from a bottom of the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. A lower portion of the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> enters the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to communicate thereto. The expansion chamber <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> has a relatively large capacity so that the exhaust gases expand there to lose energy and thus attenuates exhaust noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> An idle exhaust passage (not shown) is branched off from one of the internal passages and opens to the atmosphere above the body of water. In the illustrated embodiment, an apron <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> covers the upper portion of the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The idle exhaust passage extends through both an outer surface of the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the apron <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> depends from the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and supports a propulsion shaft which is driven by the driveshaft <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The propulsion shaft extends generally horizontally through the lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the propulsion device supports a propeller <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> that is affixed to an outer end of the propulsion shaft and is driven thereby. The propulsion device, however, can take the form of a dual, a counter-rotating system, a hydrodynamic jet, or like propulsion devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A transmission is provided between the driveshaft <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the propulsion shaft. The transmission couples together the two shafts which lie generally normal to each other (i.e., at a 90&deg; shaft angle) with a bevel gear train or the like. The transmission has a switchover or clutch mechanism to shift rotational directions of the propeller <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to forward, neutral or reverse. The switchover mechanism is operable by the operator through a shift linkage including a shift cam, a shift rod and a shift cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> also defines an internal passage that forms a discharge section of the exhaust system. An upper portion of this internal passage connects to the expansion chamber <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. At engine speed above idle, the majority of the exhaust gases are discharged toward the body of water through the internal passage and a hub of the propeller <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. At the idle speed of the engine <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the exhaust gases can be discharged only through the foregoing idle exhaust passage because the exhaust pressure under this condition is smaller than the back pressure created by the body of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the driveshaft housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a water pump <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> disposed therein which is driven by the driveshaft <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> for the water cooling system. The water is introduced into a water supply passage <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> by the water pump <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> through a water inlet port <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> provided on at least one surface of the lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that opens to the body of water surrounding the lower unit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The water is then delivered to cooling jackets of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and also to the water passage <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> through a water delivery passage <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. After cooling these components, the water is drained through a drain passage disposed at a proper location on the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and then discharged through the hub of the propeller <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> with the exhaust gases or other discharge ports. A thermostat is provided in the drain passage. If the temperature of the water is lower than a preset temperature, the thermostat will not allow the water to flow through the drain passage thus allowing the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to heat rapidly to an appropriate operating temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a situation that the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is operated for a period of time, and particularly under a high speed and/or high load condition, and then stopped, the operator occasionally has to restart the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> immediately after the stop. As the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> operates under such conditions, the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> can accumulate heat therein and thus a temperature of the liquid fuel contained therein. Because of this, the fuel becomes likely to produce a relatively large amount of fuel vapors in the space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> above the liquid fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In addition, the high-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> pressurizes the fuel to deliver it to the fuel injectors <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, and the excess fuel returns to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The return fuel is depressurized en route to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and expedites production additional fuel vapors in the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, even though the return fuel is cooled by the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> in this embodiment and aids in inhibiting the production of such vapors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The fuel vapor emission system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is provided to aid in removing or preventing the production of at least these additional fuel vapors. This system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> primarily comprises a fuel vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and a check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fuel vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> couples the space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> with the intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> that is part of the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> has a pair of vents <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> atop thereof through which the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> communicates with the space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the vents <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> are spaced apart from each other, and are disposed at different distances L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from an axis of the pivot pin <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is divided in the portion leading to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> so as to have a common portion <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> and a pair of separate portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. The separate portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> cross each other and are configured as U-shapes shapes individually. The separate portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is then coupled with the vent <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, while the separate portion <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is coupled with the vent <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This configuration of the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is advantageous for the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, particularly during a tilting movement of the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. That is, if the liquid fuel closes one vent <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>), the other vent <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>) is surely opened to release the fuel vapors in the space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. If, on the other hand, the liquid fuel flows out to one of the separate portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, the U-shaped section blocks the fuel because the fuel cannot surmount this section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is disposed in the common passage portion <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and includes, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> ball valve element <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>, a valve seat <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and a spring or biasing member <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> that biases the ball valve element <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> toward the valve seat <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. The check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> permits the fuel vapors to flow out to the intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> but prevents the oil vapors and the blow-by gases from entering the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The biasing force or pressure of the spring <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> is set at a fixed magnitude so that the ball valve element <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> stays in the closing position until a pressure of the vapors excesses the preset pressure. In other words, if the pressure of the vapors exceeds the preset pressure, then the vapors can move to the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> through this check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. In addition, the preset pressure of the spring <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is less than a pressure that is produced by the low-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Thus, the check valve <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> will not open under a normal operating condition of the low-pressure fuel pump <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a change in pressure of vapors in the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> before and after restarting the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Large amount of vapors can be produced within approximately one minute immediately after a restart of the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Due to this large amount of vapors, as reflected in this figure, the pressure of the vapors exceeds the preset pressure of the check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> for a period of time, e.g., approximately one minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Under a condition that the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not tilted and when the pressure of the vapors exceeds the preset magnitude of the check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, the vapors move out from both the vents <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> and go through both the separate portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> to the common portion <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. The vapors then move through the intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the inter camshaft chamber passage <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and reach the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Liquid oil components are removed in the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> while passing through the labyrinth structure thereof and thus only vapor components further move to the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The vapors are then mixed with the induction air and finally burned in the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It is quite advantageous to introduce the fuel vapors to the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> prior to entering the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, preferably, prior to entering the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> because they mixed with the oil vapors en route to the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The fuel vapors reduce the viscosity of the oil vapors, to promote better mixture with the induction air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, the unification of the fuel vapor emission system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> greatly simplifies the circuitry or conduits for delivering the fuel vapor to the induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. That is, a vapor reduction canister or other special devices are not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further by guiding the fuel vapors through the chambers, narrow passages and labyrinth structure in the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the fuel vapors, although the may initially be large, will be effectively diluted before reaching the air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Thus, an engine stall or other undesirable performances of the engine caused by the fuel vapors can be attenuated or even eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As noted above, when the engine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> inclines with the tilt movement of the drive unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, at least one of the separate portions <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> of the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, which cross over each other and have the U-shapes, prevents the liquid fuel from flowing out or allows the vapors to escape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> thus not only inhibits the vapors from passing therethrough but also prevents vapors from moving to the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> if the pressure of the vapors is less than the preset magnitude. The vapors, therefore, cannot continuously move to the air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> but only when the check valve mechanism <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> permits them to pass therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another construction arranged in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The same members and components that have been already described in connection with the first embodiment will be assigned with the same reference numerals and will not be described repeatedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a fuel vapor passage <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> replaces the fuel vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. This vapor passage <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is coupled to the inner ventilation passage <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> that extends in close proximity to the vapor separator <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. This arrangement allows the vapor passage <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to be shorter. In addition, the vapor passage <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is protected by the throttle bodies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the intake manifolds <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the fuel vapor emission system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be coupled with any portions of the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. For instance, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can be connected to a portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the ventilation system <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> positioned between the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and the plenum chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as shown in phantom line. Preferably, however, the vapor passage <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is coupled with portions existing upstream of the oil separator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> such as, for example, the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the exhaust camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and a space defined above the lubricant oil in the lubricant reservoir <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The greater the spacing of these portions from the air induction system, the more the vapors are diluted or evened out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In some aspects of the present invention, the fuel vapor passage can be directly connected to the air induction system. Alternatively or in addition, the vapor passage can be connected with the exhaust system so as to be burn the vapors with the heat of the exhaust gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The ventilation passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> can be connected to any portions of the air induction system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Preferably, however, the ventilation passage <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is coupled to portions existing upstream of the throttle valves <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so as to avoid influence of the negative intake pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It is also practicable that the fuel injectors spray fuel directly into the combustion chambers. Such a fuel injection system is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;direct-injection system.&rdquo; Alternatively, the fuel injection system can comprise a direct &ldquo;air/fuel&rdquo; injection system which mixes pressurized air and fuel before or during direct injection into the combustion chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Of course, the foregoing description is that of preferred embodiments of the invention, and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
