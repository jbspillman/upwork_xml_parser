<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a modular system for carrying various gear on a person. More specifically, this invention relates to a connection system that allows the modular application of various cargo holders to specialized or generic backpacks or frame harnesses. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Load bearing pack systems have been used for years in a variety of roles, including hunting, expedition, camping, military and police activities. The pack systems for each of these activities have developed into specialized designs unique to the particular activity. The pack systems for each activity have to take into consideration several features and requirements specific to each activity. Some of these features and requirements include firearm transportation, camouflage, noise creation, and the need to carry situation-specific accessories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The primary means of carrying a shoulder arm, such as a rifle, has been a shoulder sling. As firearm use has developed, the shoulder sling has failed to keep up with the needs of modern hunters, police, and military personnel. One reason is that a shoulder sling positions the firearm in an awkward position on a person&apos;s back. From this position, the firearm must be swung off the shoulder, brought to the front of the body, and both hands must be repositioned on the firearm before the firearm can be raised to the shoulder for firing. Also, when a shoulder sling is used with any sort of backpack, the positioning of the pack tends to push the sling from the shoulder, especially during any type of brisk movement. With certain types of packs, i.e., those with shoulder lift features, the use of a shoulder sling carried on the shoulder is very inconvenient if not impossible. Using a shoulder sling also make it very difficult to crawl, or use both hands for climbing, especially when combined with a backpack. In addition, the shoulder sling also leaves the rifle unprotected on the user&apos;s back, making it vulnerable to bumps and jolts, which can disrupt the optical sighting device, or even more seriously damage the gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The use of a shoulder sling also places the entire load of the firearm on the user&apos;s shoulder. As firearms become heavier (for enhanced accuracy and reduced recoil), carrying them on a shoulder sling can be uncomfortable, awkward and tiresome, especially when combined with a backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is critical that both hands are kept free for full freedom of use while keeping the firearm conveniently located for quick use, protecting the optical sighting device, and especially when used in combination with carrying other gear, such as in a backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With respect to load bearing systems, such as backpacks, many are designed for a particular purpose in mind. For instance, for hunting applications, most users have been limited to choosing between a brightly colored or blaze orange backpack and a camouflage backpack. A blaze orange backpack is undesirable where concealment is needed, and camouflage backpack may be undesirable, or illegal in certain hunting situations. Additionally, users have been required to choose between stealth and durability, between reduced noise and weatherproof performance. Backpacks made of strong, weatherproof material such as nylon, are inherently noisy, such as when contacted by foliage. Backpacks made of quiet material, such as pile or fleece, have had to sacrifice durability and foul-weather performance because these &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; materials are not as strong or weatherproof as nylon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The versatility of situation-specific accessories, such as cargo platforms, seats, hand warmers, and add-on pouches have served only a single function, which reduces the versatility of any load carrying device. Certain of these features can be an advantage, depending on the particular activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is with the shortcomings of the prior art in mind that the modular load bearing field support system of the present invention has been developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a load bearing field support system, which can be a specialized harness structure, as described below, or a standard backpack type structure. The load bearing field support system has many components and features which overcome the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a load bearing field support system having a waist belt, a pair of shoulder straps, each of the shoulder straps having a front end attached to the waist belt and a rear end attached to the waist belt, and a middle section disposed between said front and rear ends. A mounting track is attached to the waist belt, and a spatula accessory support system is included for mounting an accessory on the mounting track. The spatula accessory support system includes a flat spatula attached to an accessory, with the spatula inserted between the mounting track and the waist belt to attach the accessory to waist belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a long gun support system for supporting a firearm, having a buttstock and a barrel, from a harness having a waist band and a shoulder strap, such as the field support system described above. The long gun support system includes a cradle defining a receptacle suspended from the waist band, and a fastener attached to the shoulder strap above the waist band wherein the cradle receives the buttstock and the fastener receives the barrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a backpack having a main body defining a cavity, the main body having a front wall, a rear wall, a top wall, a bottom wall and opposing sidewalls, and having a top portion and a bottom portion. A pair of shoulder straps are attached to the main body, each extending generally from the top portion to the bottom portion of the front wall. Left and right waist band portions are attached to the main body and extend forwardly from the front wall. A panel extension is included which has a top end and a bottom end, and is pivotally attached at its bottom end to the bottom portion of the main body. A tie strap extends from the top portion of the main body to the top end of the panel extension. The tie strap supports the top end of the panel in the various positions, such as extending forwardly of the back pack, extending rearwardly of the back pack, and collapsing to extend adjacent to the rear wall of the back pack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The instant invention also entails a backpack including a main body defining a cavity, the main body having a front wall, a rear wall, a top wall, a bottom wall and opposing sidewalls, and having a top portion and a bottom portion. A pair of shoulder straps are attached to the main body, each extending generally from the top portion to the bottom portion of the front wall. Left and right waist band portions are attached to the main body and extend forwardly of the front wall. A supplemental fabric panel is included for covering the rear wall, and means for attaching the fabric panel to the rear wall are included. The fabric panel reduces noise created by contacting the rear wall during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates a hand warmer for use on a garment having laterally spaced members, the hand warmer including a main body having a front wall, a rear wall, a top edge, opposing side edges, and a bottom edge. A recess is formed between front and rear walls, and an opening is formed in each side edge to allow access to the recess. Fastening means are attached to the main body at the intersection of each side edge with the top edge to suspend the hand warmer between the two laterally spaced members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The load bearing field support system of the present invention described herein provides great flexibility in outfitting the user. The multi-purpose harness with the spatula support system allows the user to carry only what he desires, and in the particular location as desired by the user. The long gun support system as part of the overall support system, provides advantages in carrying the long gun conveniently and safely, while keeping both hands available for use. In addition, the extension panel, as well as the quiet fabric panels, provide additional functionality to the support system overall support system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A more complete appreciation of the present invention and its scope can be obtained from understanding the accompanying drawings, which are briefly summarized below, the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The modular load bearing field support system of the present invention includes the application of various cargo carriers to either harness systems, specialized backpacks, or standard backpacks. The support system is also contemplated to include the application of various cargo carriers to vests, lumbar packs, or other types of load bearing outerwear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A support system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The support system is effectively a harness worn by a user. The harness is a modular carry system that includes attachment points for securing accessories, many of which are described below. The harness includes a waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in conjunction with shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is preferably a padded elongated member having free ends, each end having a matching releasable fastener, such as a quick-release buckle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The quick-release buckle also includes a means for adjusting the length of the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, such as by extracting or retracting excess waist belt length. The waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> fastens around the waist of a user, and can be adjusted in length to fit the waist of the particular user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of attachment points <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> positioned along its top edge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The attachment points <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are used to secure either the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or other accessories to the waist band <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The attachment points <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are preferably common loop attachments, three-bar sliders, or ladder locks as required for the particular application. A suitable ladder lock is the standard Mojave&trade; Curved Release by National Molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A series of nylon webbing lengths <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are attached to the outside of the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The nylon webbing lengths <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are attached to the waist belt only at their opposing ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The nylon webbing lengths <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned along the top half <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the waist belt, for purposes described later. The nylon webbing lengths can be positioned anywhere along the length of the waist belt, such as on either side of the buckle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (over a user&apos;s hips), or as two separate sections opposite the buckle. The nylon webbing lengths <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> act as mounting tracks for various pieces of gear, cargo and accessories, and as such are securely fastened to the waist belt. The mounting tracks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> should be relatively taut between the opposing ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> attached to the waist belt. The mounting tracks have a releasable fastener <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, such as Velcro&reg; material (either hook or loop, as desired) attached to the inner surface of the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> facing the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Reference is made throughout to Velcro&reg; fasteners. It is contemplated that any hook and loop type releasable fastener can be used, but for convenience, such fasteners are referred to as Velcro&reg; fasteners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which attach to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to form the harness system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are two substantially identical shoulder straps, each having padded shoulder sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, an adjustable-length rear extension <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from the shoulder section, and an adjustable length front extension <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the shoulder section. The rear extension <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and front extension <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are preferably nylon webbing, and are adjustable by any known means from the padded section, such as by a ladder lock. The rear extensions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are positioned through a three-bar <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> slider and criss-cross before attaching to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The free rear ends <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the rear extensions attach to the ladder lock attachment points <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This adjustably anchors the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the rear of the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The free front ends <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the front extension terminate in three bar sliders <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. These three-bar sliders then fit length wise through the common loop <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> attachments <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and are retained in the common loop <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> so they cannot be extracted without being oriented lengthwise to fit back through the common loop <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In this way the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are attached to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to form the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The common loop and three-bar slider attachment structure is described in more detail with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Mounting tracks <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are positioned on the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, preferably on the padded portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, to support attachment structures <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, such as a three-bar slider having an integrally-formed laterally extending common loop <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The mounting tracks <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are analogous to those mounted on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The attachment structures <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, discussed in more detail below, allow accessories to be attached to each strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> individually, or between the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is light-weight, simple to adjust, and can carry a variety of accessories attached to the various attachment points <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, as are described below. The flexibility of the system allows the user to attach only the desired gear. It is contemplated that the mounting tracks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> could be attached to the waist belt or shoulder strap, if proper, of any load carrying device, including a backpack, vest or lumbar pack. The benefits of the various features of the attachment system described herein benefit all such applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> One component for use with the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a large pouch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or day bag, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The day bag is a receptacle having a front wall <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a rear wall <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, a bottom wall <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a top wall and opposing sidewalls <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A zipper <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> extending between the sidewalls <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and over the top wall <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> allows access to the storage cavity formed therein. The day bag <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has two spaced fasteners <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> at the top of the rear wall <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and two spaced fasteners <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the rear wall <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The fasteners <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are preferably fixed three-bar sliders attached at their middle bar to a length of webbing, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The top fasteners <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> attach to the common loops <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> on the rear end of the padded section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the bottom fasteners <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> attach to the common loops <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> affixed to the waist belt. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the fixed three-bar sliders fit lengthwise through the loops, but are then incapable of being retracted through the loops unless properly oriented. This attachment structure can be used for many releasable attachment needs, and is referred to hereinafter as the three-bar/common loop attachment structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The day bag <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> described herein is one modular component that is able to be easily attached to and disconnected from the harness system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as desired by the user. When attached, and the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is worn by a user, the day bag <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> rests on the user&apos;s back and is supported by the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the harness. Other types of carrying bags or other accessories can also be attached in this way to the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The spatula attachment system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for securing articles to the mounting tracks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. A pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> incorporating the spatula mounting system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has outer walls defining an interior cargo space, and a zipper <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> opening on its top surface to allow closeable access to the cargo space. It is anticipated that the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could have any useable shape and size as desired by the user for the intended purpose. The spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is attached to the rear wall <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and includes a relatively thin and rigid spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> attached along a seam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (such as by sewing) at its upper end to the rear wall adjacent the upper end of the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> lays against the rear wall <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and can pivot about its attachment to the rear wall (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can have a square, rectangular, or sloping profile as desired. Generally, the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> should be relatively wide side-to-side to support as much of the cargo carrier as possible, and relatively thin front-to-back to insert easily into the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as noted below. Two laterally spaced spatulas can be used on one cargo carrier if the cargo carrier is relatively long in the dimension supported by the waist belt, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A first securing strap <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is fixed to the lower end of the outer side of the spatula, and a second securing strap <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is affixed to the top end of the inner side of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A Velcro&reg; fastener portion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (opposite to that attached to the inside of the mounting track) is affixed to the top end of the inner side of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also, and extends across substantially the entire width of the spatula. A common loop fastener <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is attached to the bottom of the rear wall of the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> allows the attachment of the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a convenient, well-supported and secure manner. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is inserted between the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> such that the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> engages the attachment seam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the top of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The Velcro&reg; portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> affixed to the inside face of the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> engages the opposite Velcro&reg; portion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> attached to the inside face of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to help secure the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in place on the mounting track. The spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will thus not likely move along the length mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, even during vigorous activity. In addition, to provide additional stability and security, the first securing strap <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> extends through the common loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and back up between the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to engage the second securing loop <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to form an interlocked Velcro&reg; connection. This helps insure, along with the engagement of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, that the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> does not accidentally disconnect from the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. It is contemplated that engagement by the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> alone with the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is sufficient to support and securely attach a cargo carrier <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The additional position stabilizing structure provides enhanced benefits, but are not required to be used. The position of the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the top half <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows the bottom of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to rest on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to further stabilize the position of the pouch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The spatula mounting system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> allows the user to conveniently and securely mount the desired type of cargo carrier to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the desired location. The spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> spreads the load of the cargo carrier along the length of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (such as along the length of the seam attaching the spatula to the cargo carrier) to provide better load distribution and load stability. The cargo carrier is thus easily removed or its position adjusted by the user. The spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be used to attach a variety of components to the waist belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As noted above, where a cargo carrier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is relatively long in the dimension to be supported by the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, more than one spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be used to sufficiently support and securely attach the cargo carrier <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. An elongated cargo carrier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which requires the use of two laterally spaced spatulas <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, each having the same structure as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The elongated cargo carrier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is adequately secured to and supported on the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by the two spatula systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>show the application of the spatula mounting system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on a cargo carrier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> having an elongated dimension orthogonal to the length of the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The shotgun shell dispenser has two vertically spaced spatula systems <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> attached to its rear face. If the dispenser is to be carried on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, only one of the spatula systems would be used to attach to the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Where the shell dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is required to be supported securely along its length, such as when it is worn on a vest in a police or military operation, both of the two vertically spaced spatula systems <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be employed. This requires that the support structure, such as the vest, have two vertically spaced mounting tracks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the two vertically spaced spatula systems to be affixed to, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The shell dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the present invention is unique in its storage and mode of dispensing shells. The dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has an elongated, vertically oriented, rectangular body defining an interior cavity. The dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has a front wall <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, a rear wall <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, two opposing sidewalls <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a bottom wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and a pair of overlapping flaps <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> forming the top wall. The dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to have a side-to-side width sufficient to hold a shot gun shell lengthwise, a front-to-back depth sufficient to hold a shotgun shell widthwise, and a top-to-bottom length to hold a plurality of shotgun shells stacked side-by-side on one another. The two overlapping flaps <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the top wall secure to one another, such as by a Velcro&reg; fastener, to allow access to the interior cavity. A dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is formed at the lower end of one of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> defines an aperture having four sides <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, three of which are made of the material of the dispenser, and are relatively fixed in length. The fourth side <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is made of a resilient material that can change dimension and return to its original dimension, such as elastic. The dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is smaller than the outer dimension of the shotgun shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The shells are positioned in the dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> such that the primer end is adjacent the side having the dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the end of the bottom most shell is substantially covered only around its perimeter by three of the four sides <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, of the dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, one of which is the resilient wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. To dispense a shell, the user grasps the opposite end of the bottom-most shell through the front <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and rear dispenser walls <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and pinches the walls to push the shell towards the dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. As the primer end of the shell is pushed through the dispensing port, the resilient wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> stretches to allow the shell to exit the port, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The user then grasps the shell and pulls it the rest of the way out of the dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The resilient wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> then returns to its normal position, such as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The rest of the shells in the dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> shift downwardly to set up the next shell adjacent to the dispensing port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Unless the shell is forced through the dispenser port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to deform the resilient wall <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the resilient wall is sufficiently sturdy to keep the shells from exiting the dispenser port <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The shell dispenser <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is designed to hold a plurality of shells, for instance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is made of nylon webbing which forms a receptacle <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and holds the buttstock of the long gun <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (such as a rifle or shot gun). As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the cradle receptacle includes a support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> attached to the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> forming the backbone of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Two opposing side members <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> extend outwardly and downwardly from the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The two opposing side members <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> curve forwardly and attach together in front of and spaced away from the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> forming a loop <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The opposing side members <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> attach together at a point below where they attach to the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. This allows for easier removal of the buttstock from the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> forms the bottom <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the cradle by extending downwardly and then curving upwardly to meet and attach to the ends of the side members <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> holds the generally wedge-shaped buttstock of the firearm securely. A buttstock can be removed from the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by being moved upwardly. It is very difficult to remove the buttstock from the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in any other direction. Since the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably made of webbing or other such material, it conforms to different sizes and shapes of buttstocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the cradle is attached to the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. For use with the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a ladder lock <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> attached to the top of the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> adjustably engages the ladder lock <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> so as to hang from the ladder lock, and thus from the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The first <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> security straps are attached on the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as described above, as is the Velcro&reg; portion. A protective flap <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is attached to the spatula <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to hang over the ladder lock <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to protect the buttstock from being scratched by the ladder lock <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In attaching the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is inserted between the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as described above with the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the first <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> security straps are fastened together. In use with the gun cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the first <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> security straps do not attach through a loop on the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as the earlier security straps attach through a common loop on the pouch. Nonetheless, the security straps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> securely fix the spatula <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The buttstock is then placed in the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, preferably with the trigger facing forwardly (to the right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The weight of the long gun <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is thus suspended from the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and thus the user&apos;s waist and hips, by the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The lateral position of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is secure when on the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be positioned anywhere along the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to adjust for waist size. The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be moved upwardly or downwardly with respect to the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by extending or retracting the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in the ladder lock <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> on the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This helps adjust the position of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> according to the length of the long gun <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. An additional mounting track <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> can be positioned on the front of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to support another cargo carrier <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (such as a cartridge case) using the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In addition to the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> includes a barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to releasably attach the barrel to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> while the buttstock is in the cradle. See. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> includes an elongated flexible main member <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> with opposing ends. A quick-release cam lock buckle fastener <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is fixed to one end of the main member <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the main member is free. A suitable cam lock buckle fastener <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is the Fix Lock&reg; <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight> by Illinois Toolworks, Inc. of Chicago, Ill. The free end of the main member <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can be releasably secured in the quick-release cam lock fastener <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, and is also adjustable in length to surround differently sized barrels. The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is released by simply grasping the free end of the main member <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and pulling to release the quick-release fastener <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The barrel of the firearm <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is then disconnected from the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and can be grasped by the same or different hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is attached to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by a tail <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> member. The tail <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is affixed to and extends upwardly from the main member <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The top end of the tail <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> has a folded over portion <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> which is sewn to itself, forming a seam. The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is positioned on the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by inserting the tail <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> into the three-bar slider <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> positioned on the mounting track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> attached to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.) The folded over top portion <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> of the tail acts as a mechanical jam member in the three-bar slider <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and thus resists the removal of the tail <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> therefrom. Relatively less up/down force is applied to the three-bar slider <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> because most forces are laterally directed, and as such the three-bar slider <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is not likely to move appreciably up and down the mounting track <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> when the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In using the long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is attached to the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the spatula is attached to the mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the waist belt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, as described above. Preferably, the spatula <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is applied adjacent to or just in front of the hip of the user. The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is attached to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the same side of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be vertically adjusted to accommodate the length of the long gun. The buttstock is inserted into the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with the trigger facing forward. The barrel of the gun is releasably secured to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the long gun is supported from the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and held closely along the user&apos;s body by the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. This allows the user to keep both hands free for climbing, working or any other purpose. The long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> also allows the firearm to remain handy even when using a load supporting system having a shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> like the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The optical sighting device on the firearm, if any, is positioned under the user&apos;s arm in a relatively protected location. The long gun support system allows a user to carry support gear in the day bag on the harness (with shoulder straps) while at the same time carrying a long gun. The system allows all this in a manner that is comfortable, protects the long gun, and keeps the long gun ready for immediate use. The long gun is thus carried more securely, safely and in a more accessible location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The long gun support system also allows the firearm to be quickly removed from the support system and shouldered. The user simply releases the quick-release fastener <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> (left hand per <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and grasps the buttstock with one hand (right hand per <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and then the barrel with the other (left hand per <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The user lifts the rifle slightly upwardly to remove the buttstock from the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and then shoulder&apos;s the firearm. There are different manners by which the firearm can be released from the support system, but each requires the release of the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and slightly lifting the firearm to remove it from the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Other long items that are often carried while hunting, hiking or backpacking can be carried with a similar support structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show structures used for carrying fly rods <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and spinning rods <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a fly rod <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is supported from a spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The only difference between the fly rod <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> system and the long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is that the cradle is replaced by a padded, cylindrical receptacle <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> having adjustable cylindrical sidewalls, an open top and a base. The end of the fly rod, including the reel, is inserted into the receptacle <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The receptacle is sized, using releasable fasteners <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, such as Velcro&reg;, to overlap more or less of the receptacle wall to create the right size (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The end of the rod and reel <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> are securely held in place in the receptacle <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The top end of the rod is held in place by the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as described above with respect to the gun barrel. In this manner the fly rod <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and reel are securely supported on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the harness, and secured along the body of the user by attaching to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which gives the user the same advantages as denoted previously. The rod <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is released from the fly rod support system in the identical manner as noted for the long gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A support system for a spinning rod <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this case, the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is replaced by a cylindrical spin rod receptacle <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> having an open top, a cylindrical sidewall and a base. The end of the spin rod <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the spin rod receptacle <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, with the reel extending outwardly from the pole above the receptacle <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the receptacle <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is frustoconical in shape to guide or even wedge the end of the spin rod <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> therein for a secure fit. The top end of the spinning rod is held in place by the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as described above. In this manner the spinning rod <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is securely supported on the waist belt <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and secured along the body of the user by attaching to the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which gives the user the same advantages as denoted previously. The rod is released from the spin rod support system in the identical manner as noted for the long gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A long gun support system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> was described above for applications on a harness having the required mounting track <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the spatula system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Another embodiment of the instant invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, allows the long gun support system <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, including the gun cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, to be used on backpacks and load bearing systems not including the mounting tracks <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The gun cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is identical to that described earlier. Instead of using a spatula system, however, the gun cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is supported from the padded waist belt <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of a generic backpack by a universal attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> having a ladder lock <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> affixed thereto for securing the support member <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (as discussed above), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The universal attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is a flexible elongated nylon webbing with Velcro&reg; fastener attached to one side, and the opposite Velcro&reg; fastener attached to the opposite side. The strap could be Velcro&reg; alone. The attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the waist belt <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> at the desired location (such as adjacent the user&apos;s hip), and the strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> fastened thereto by the Velcro&reg;, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is attached tightly enough to minimize any lateral, vertical or rotational movement of the attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> along the waist belt <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The length of the attachment strap <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is relatively longer for a padded waist belt <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and relatively shorter for an unpadded waist belt (not shown). The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> thus functions identically to that described above utilizing the spatula system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The barrel fastener <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to that described above, except that instead of a tail extending from the main member, a Velcro&reg; attachment loop <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extends therefrom to secure around a generic shoulder strap <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that does not have the three-bar slider or the mounting track. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The attachment loop <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> fastens around the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at the desired location. Since little vertical load is placed on the barrel fastener <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, the attachment loop <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> does not slide appreciably up or down the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The quick-release fastener <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is again used to releasably secure the gun barrel as described above. The operation to remove the firearm from the embodiment of the long gun support system is identical to that described above. Using this embodiment of the long gun support system in conjunction with any type of backpack tends to stabilize and secure the long gun, especially during any type of brisk movement. The gun is in front of the shoulder, and thus there is relatively no interference with the &ldquo;shoulder lift&rdquo; feature found on some backpacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Similar universal attachment systems can be used to attach the fly rod and spinning rod support systems to a backpack or load bearing system that does not include the mounting track (and thus cannot use the spatula system), all with the same benefit as earlier described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the instant invention includes the use of a semi-rigid multi-purpose panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> extension pivotally attached to the bottom of a backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and supported by tie-straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the top of the backpack. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be oriented to extend substantially orthogonally in front of the pack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for use as a seat. Alternatively, the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be oriented to extend substantially orthogonally behind the pack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for use as a cargo carrier to haul out large objects, such as game. In each orientation, the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is supported by tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> extending to the upper sides of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In the travel mode, or the collapsed position, the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be folded up to lie adjacent to the rear wall of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and secured there by shortening the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is a rectangularly shaped padded flat panel having aluminum stays <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> along its side edges for improved strength and stability. The bottom edge <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the panel is attached at least in two places along its width dimension to the bottom <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The attachment is by a three bar slider/common loop attachment structure <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> that acts as a hinge to allow the panel to flip from extending forwardly to extending rearwardly, and to extending upwardly to lie against the backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> extend from the top of each side of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to the corresponding corner of the free end <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (top end) of the panel. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The upper end of the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be attached to the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> at any location sufficient to provide the proper support to the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are positioned high enough on the pack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to securely hold the panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the collapsed position, discussed below. The top end of the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are respectively attached to the backpack using the three-bar/common loop attachment structure <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Preferably in this case the common loop <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> attached to the backpack is triangular in shape to more securely hold the three-bar slider. The bottom end of each tie strap is secured to the respective corner <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> through a tension lock buckle <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, or any other attachment structure that allows the strap to be fixed in position, yet be adjusted when so required. The tension lock (ladder lock) buckle <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is attached to the panel by a fabric brace <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, preferably offset from the corners. By shortening the tie straps through the tension lock buckle <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, the panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be pulled into the collapsed position to lie against the rear wall of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. By loosening the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the tension lock buckle <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, the panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be positioned to extend orthogonally from the rear of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this position the panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> acts as a freight shelf so that large objects can be supported by the panel when the backpack is being worn. The panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> supports the large items outside of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> so as to not contaminate the contents of the backpack. The panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> could also extend at an angle downwardly or upwardly from the rear of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as desired by adjusting the length of the tie strap <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the tension lock buckle <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The panel can extend from the front of the backpack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) to act as a chair. The panel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is either disconnected from the tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, or the tie straps are lengthened to their maximum length and the panel swung under the pack <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to extend forwardly from the front of the backpack. The tie straps <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> connect the panel to the pack to allow a user to sit on the panel and lean back on the backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the support system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The tie straps are attached at their upper ends to the shoulder straps, and at the bottom ends to the top end of the panel. The bottom end of the panel is pivotably attached to the back of the waist belt in a similar manner to that described above for attaching it to the backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the instant invention is the reversible and removable noise reduction system. Walking through brush or trees can create loud noises as the foliage contacts the backpack material. The application of fabric panels to the major exterior surfaces of the backpack drastically reduces the noise from foliage contact. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>show an embodiment of the fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> applied to the exterior of a backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to obtain the noise reduction benefit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is shown having a main body <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> defining an internal cavity, shoulder straps <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and waist band <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> has a rear surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> having opposing side edges <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and which may include grommets <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> for holding a bungee cord attachment structure. A fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is applied to the rear surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and is attached along its side edges <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> to the corresponding side edges <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the rear surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can be made of any soft, non-snagging fabric, such as Polarfleece&reg; fabric, manufactured by Malden Mills. The panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has finished edges to avoid unraveling or other type of contact damage. The fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is releasably attached along the side edges <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the backpack. One such means to attach the panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is by a sandwich of Velcro&reg; fasteners, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> defines two flaps <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> extending along each vertical side edge <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, with the inner faces of each flap <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> having a hook or loop Velcro&reg; fastener portion attached thereto. The vertical edges <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the rear surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> each have a single flap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> extending therefrom, preferably continuously, with the opposite hook or loop Velcro&reg; fabric fastener portion attached to the opposite sides thereof. The two flaps <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> on either edge <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> engage both sides of the single flap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> on both edges <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to securely position the fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> on the backpack. The panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, so secured, is not difficult to accidentally remove from the backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The fabric panel can have slits <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> formed therein, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to facilitate the positioning of the panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> over the grommets or other features on the rear surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that are desired to be accessible when the fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is multi-functional. It not only reduces noise levels, but also can change the color and thus customize the backpack for different uses. The fabric panels can have different color combinations or designs on either side so that when reversed the panel converts from one desired color to the next. For instance, one side can be blaze orange, and the other camouflage. In addition, the fabric panel can be removed to expose a third color, which is the color of the backpack itself. Thus, the fabric panels both reduce noise generation and provide multi-functional color combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> While an example is provided for attaching the fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to the rear surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the backpack <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, a fabric panel <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can be attached to any other surface of the backpack, including the top, sides, front and bottom, by similar means to obtain similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A fabric panel <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is a valuable noise reduction and color enhancement addition for use with the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as described above. The fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> for use with the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> includes a main body made of the fabric. The main body is shaped the substantially the same as the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and has a beading finish on its peripheral edges. The main body fabric can be one color on one side and an alternative color on the other. A loop member <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is attached at each corner to secure an elastic cord guide <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. An adjustable length elastic cord <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends through each cord guide <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> around the perimeter of the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is applied to the rear surface of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> using unique corner fasteners. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The loop members <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> at each corner of the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> extend over the corresponding corner <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. This anchors and secures the position of the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> on the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. This also positions the cord guides <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> inside the perimeter of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> on the opposite side (front side) of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to which the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is applied. When the elastic cord <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is tightened using the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, the cord guides <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> are biased toward the center of the front side of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and pull the loop members <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> taut around the corners <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to secure the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> in place. To remove the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> from the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the elastic cord <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is loosened, and the loop members <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are removed from the corners <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When the panel extension <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is in the collapsed mode, the fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is facing outwardly away from the backpack. The fabric panel <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> thus applied provides the color variations desired by the user, reduces noise generation cause by foliage contact, and also acts as a seat cushion when the panel extension is positioned to extend forwardly of the backpack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Another accessory for use with the harness described above is a hand warmer pouch suspended between shoulder straps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the harness <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.
