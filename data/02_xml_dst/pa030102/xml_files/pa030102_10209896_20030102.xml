<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Sleeve molding apparatus and methods for making multi-layer injection molded plastic articles in successive mold cavities. In a first molding step, an inner sleeve is molded on a core in a first mold cavity, which may comprise a full body length sleeve or only a partial sleeve, such as an upper neck finish portion. The sleeve and core are withdrawn from the first mold cavity while the sleeve is still warm, and transferred without substantial delay to a second mold cavity for injection molding an outer layer which bonds to the inner sleeve. By transferring the sleeve at an elevated temperature into the second mold cavity, an improved bond is formed between the inner sleeve and outer layer which resists separation during a later reheat stretch blow molding step, and/or in use of the resulting article. In a preferred embodiment, a pasteurizable beer container is provided having a finish-only sleeve of a PEN polymer. In a second embodiment, a returnable and refillable water container is provided having a full-length body sleeve of a PEN polymer. A multi-station injection molding apparatus is provided having a transfer mechanism, such as a rotatable turret or reciprocating shuttle, for cost-effective manufacture of preforms simultaneously in multiple cavity sets. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for making multilayer injection-molded plastic articles such as preforms, wherein the successive molding of an inner sleeve and outer layer enables cost-effective production of multilayer preforms for pasteurizable, hot-fillable, and returnable and refillable beverage containers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,516 to Krishnakumar et al. a method for forming multilayer preforms in a single injection mold cavity. In that method, successive injections of different thermoplastic materials are made into the bottom of the mold cavity. The materials flow upwardly to fill the cavity and form for example a five-layer structure across the sidewall. This five-layer structure can be made with either two materials (i.e., the first and third injected materials are the same) or three materials (i.e., the first and third injected materials are different). Both structures are in widespread commercial use for beverage and other food containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An example of a two-material, five-layer (2M, 5L) structure has inner, outer and core layers of virgin polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and intermediate barrier layers of ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). An example of a three-material, five-layer (3M, 5L) structure has inner and outer layers of virgin PET, intermediate barrier layers of EVOH, and a core layer of recycled or post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PC-PET). Two reasons for the commercial success of these containers are that: (1) the amount of relatively expensive barrier material (e.g., EVOH) can be minimized by providing very thin intermediate layers; and (2) the container resists delamination of the layers without the use of adhesives to bond the dissimilar materials. Also, by utilizing PC-PET in the core layer, the cost of each container can be reduced without a significant change in performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although the above five-layer, and other three-layer (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,723) structures work well for a variety of containers, as additional high-performance and expensive materials become available there is an on-going need for processes which enable close control over the amount of materials used in a given container structure. For example, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) is a desirable polyester for use in blow-molded containers. PEN has an oxygen barrier capability about five times that of PET, and a higher heat stability temperature&mdash;about 250&deg; F. (120&deg; C.) for PEN, compared to about 175&deg; F. (80&deg; C.) for PET. These properties make PEN useful for the storage of oxygen-sensitive products (e.g., food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals), and/or for use in containers subject to high temperatures (e.g., refill or hot-fill containers). However, PEN is substantially more expensive than PET and has different processing requirements: Thus, at present the commercial use of PEN is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another high-temperature application is pasteurization&mdash;a pasteurizable container is filled and sealed at room temperature, and then exposed to an elevated temperature bath for about ten minutes or longer. The pasteurization process initially imposes high temperatures and positive internal pressures, followed by a cooling process which creates a vacuum in the container. Throughout these procedures, the sealed container must resist deformation so as to remain acceptable in appearance, within a designated volume tolerance, and without leakage. In particular, the threaded neck finish must resist deformation which would prevent a complete seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A number of methods have been proposed for strengthening the neck finish. One approach is to add an additional manufacturing step whereby the neck finish, of the preform or container, is exposed to a heating element and thermally crystallized. However, this creates several problems. During crystallization, the polymer density increases, which produces a volume decrease; therefore, in order to obtain a desired neck finish dimension, the as-molded dimension must be larger than the final (crystallized) dimension. It is thus difficult to achieve close dimensional tolerances and, in general, the variability of the critical neck finish dimensions after crystallization are approximately twice that prior to crystallization. Another detriment is the increased cost of the additional processing step, as it requires both time and the application of energy (heat). The cost of producing a container is very important because of competitive pressures and is tightly controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An alternative method of strengthening the neck finish is to crystallize select portions thereof, such as the top sealing surface and flange. Again, this requires an additional heating step. Another alternative is to use a high T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>material in one or more layers of the neck finish. This also involves more complex injection molding procedures and apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be desirable to provide an injection-molded article such as a preform which incorporates certain high-performance materials, and a commercially acceptable method of manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for making a multilayer injection-molded plastic article, such as a preform, which is both cost-effective and enables control over the amounts of materials used in the various layers and/or portions of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a method/embodiment of the invention, an inner sleeve is molded on a first core positioned in a first mold cavity. The inner sleeve is only partially cooled before being transferred while still at an elevated temperature to a second mold cavity where an outer layer is molded over the inner sleeve. By providing the inner sleeve in the second mold cavity at the elevated temperature, bonding between the inner sleeve and outer layer is enabled during the second molding step, such that layer separation is avoided in the final molded article. The inner sleeve may comprise a full-length inner sleeve, extending substantially the full length of the article, or alternatively may comprise only an upper portion of the article, in which case the outer layer comprises a lower portion of the article and there is some intermediate portion in which the outer layer is bonded to the inner sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a first thermoplastic material is used to make an inner sleeve which comprises a neck finish portion of the preform. The first thermoplastic material is preferably a thermal resistant material having a relatively high T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>, and/or forms a crystallized neck finish during the first molding step. In contrast, a lower body portion of the preform is made of a second thermoplastic material having a relatively lower thermal resistance and/or lower crystallization rate compared to the first material, and forms a substantially amorphous body-forming portion of the preform. In one example, by achieving crystallization in the neck finish during the first molding step, the initial and finish dimensions are the same so that the dimensional variations caused by the prior art post-molding crystallization step (and the expense thereof) are eliminated. Also, a higher average level of crystallization can be achieved in the finish, by utilizing the higher melt temperatures and/or elevated pressures of the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a full-length body sleeve is provided made of a high-performance thermoplastic resin, such as PEN homopolymer, copolymer or blend. The PEN inner sleeve provides enhanced thermal stability and reduced flavor absorption, both of which are useful in refill applications. The amount of PEN used is minimized by this process which enables production of a very thin inner sleeve layer, compared to a relatively thick outer layer (made of one or more lower-performance resins). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus for the cost-effective manufacture of such preforms. The apparatus includes at least one set of first and second molding cavities, the first mold cavity being adapted to form the inner sleeve and the second mold cavity adapted to form the outer layer. A transfer mechanism includes at least one set of first and second cores, wherein the cores are successively positionable in the first and second molding cavities. In one cycle, a first core is positioned in a first mold cavity while a first inner sleeve is molded on the first core, while a second core, carrying a previously-molded second inner sleeve, is positioned in a second mold cavity, for molding a second outer layer over the second inner sleeve. By simultaneously molding in two sets of cavities, an efficient process is provided. By molding different portions/layers of the articles separately in different cavities, different temperatures and/or pressures may be used to obtain different molding conditions and thus different properties in the different portions/layers. For example, it is possible to mold the crystallized neck finish portion in a first cavity, while molding a substantially amorphous outer layer in the second cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The resulting injection-molded articles, and/or expanded injection-molded articles, may thus have a layer structure which is not obtainable with prior processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The following chart provides temperature/time/pressure ranges for certain preferred embodiments, which are described in greater detail in the following sections: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D illustrate schematically one method embodiment for making a preform with a full-length body sleeve and a single outer layer; this preform is particularly useful for making a returnable and refillable water bottle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a first core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> positioned in a first mold cavity <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and forming a chamber therebetween in which there is formed an injection-molded inner sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is partially cooled and then the core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> carrying sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removed from the first mold cavity as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. While still warm, the sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on core <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is inserted into a second mold cavity <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which forms an interior molding chamber for forming an outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> over the inner sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. After the second molding step, a preform <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been formed including outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and inner sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>. The inner sleeve includes a top flange <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which will form the top sealing surface of the resulting container (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The first method embodiment will now be described in greater detail in regard to the apparatus shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, and a time sequence of operations illustrated in the time line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, a four-sided rotatable turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is interposed between a fixed platen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a movable platen <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on an injection-molding machine. The turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted on a carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is slidable in the direction of platen motion (shown by arrows A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotatable (shown by arrow A<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) about an axis <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> disposed perpendicular to the direction of platen motion. The turret is rotatable into two operative positions spaced 180&deg; apart. In each of these positions, the two opposing faces <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the turret carrying first and second sets of cores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively, are received in a first set of cavities <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the movable platen <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a second set of cavities <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the fixed platen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. After a core set has been successfully positioned in each of the mold cavities, the finished preforms may be ejected from the cores. Each of the mold cavity and core sets include water passages 15 for heating or cooling of the cavities/cores to achieve a desired temperature during molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The sequence of operations for forming a particular preform will now be described. The preform has a full-body sleeve of a PEN polymer, such as homopolymer PEN, or a PEN/PET copolymer or blend. The preform has a single outer layer made of virgin PET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the movable platen <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> carrying the first set of mold cavities <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carrying the turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, are each moved on guide bars (tie rods) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the left towards the fixed platen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to close the mold (i.e., both cavities). The first set of cores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the left face <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the turret are positioned in the first cavity set <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (first molding station); each first core/cavity pair defines an enclosed chamber for molding an inner sleeve about the first core. The PEN polymer is injected via nozzle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the first mold cavities to form the inner sleeve. Simultaneously, the second core set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (on the second face <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the turret) is positioned in the second cavity set <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (second molding station). Virgin PET is injected via nozzle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the second set of cavities to form a single outer layer about a previously-formed inner sleeve on each of the second cores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Next, the mold is opened as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> by moving both the movable platen <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and carriage <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the left, whereby the first cores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are removed from the first cavity <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are removed from the second cavity <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Now, the finished preforms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the second core set are ejected. The finished preforms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be ejected into a set of robot cooling tubes (not shown) as is well known in the art. Next, the turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotated 180&deg;, whereby the first set of cores <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with the inner sleeves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereon are now on the right side of the turret (and ready for insertion into the second set of cavities), while the second set of (empty) cores <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is now on the left side of the turret (ready for insertion into the first set of mold cavities). Again, the mold is closed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and injection of the polymer materials into the first and second sets of cavities proceeds as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the first and second cores are held at a temperature in a range on the order of 60-70&deg; C., whether they are positioned in the first mold cavities or the second mold cavities. The first mold cavities (for forming the inner sleeve) are held at a temperature on the order of 85-95&deg; C. The melt temperature of the PEN polymer is on the order of 285-295&deg; C. The cycle time in the first mold cavity is on the order of 6-7 seconds, i.e., the time lapse between the first and second injections. This is because, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hold and cool stage is substantially eliminated in the first mold cavities. The outer surface temperature of the sleeve (opposite the inner surface engaging the core) at the start of the second injection is 100-110&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> During the second molding step, the core temperature is again at 60-70&deg; C., but the second mold cavity temperature is 5-10&deg; C. (much lower than the first cavity temperature, to enable quick cooling of the preform). The melt temperature of the virgin PET is on the order of 260 to 275&deg; C.; this is lower than the melt temperature of the PEN polymer, but because the PEN polymer is still warm (at a temperature of 100-110&deg; C.) during the second molding step, there is melt adhesion (including diffusion bonding and chain entanglement) which occurs between the PEN polymer chains and virgin PET polymer chains (inner sleeve and outer layer) respectively. The cycle time for the second molding step is on the order of 35 to 37 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a time line with the cycle time along the x axis (time in seconds), and the sequence of steps in the second cavity set shown above the x axis, and the sequence of steps in the first cavity set shown below the x axis. At t&equals;0, the mold is closed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) and the pressure is built up. At t&equals;1.5 seconds, the second cavity (for forming the outer layer) is filled, the pressure boosted, and then the pressure reduced during the hold and cooling stage; this continues until t&equals;33 seconds in the second cavity. Meanwhile, no action is required at t&equals;1.5 seconds in the first cavity (&ldquo;no action period&rdquo;); rather, it is not until t&equals;31 seconds that the first cavity is filled and the pressure increased and held, until t&equals;33 seconds. This substantial elimination of the hold and cooling stage (in the first cavity) produces an inner sleeve which is still at an elevated temperature when it is subsequently is positioned in the second cavity, and enables melt adhesion between the outer surface of the inner sleeve and outer layer. At t&equals;33 seconds, the mold is opened (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), and the preforms from the second cavity are ejected. Then, at t&equals;35 seconds, the turret <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotated so as to position the still-warm sleeves (just made in the first cavity) in a position to be inserted into the second cavity, while the now-empty core set (previously in the second cavity) is now positioned to be inserted in the first cavity. At t&equals;36 seconds, we are ready to begin the next cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The method and apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be advantageously used to produce multilayer preforms for a great variety of applications, including refill, hot-fill and pasteurizable containers. A number of alternative embodiments are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The preform made according to the method and apparatus of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a full-body inner sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of PEN polymer, and a single outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of virgin PET. The preform is substantially transparent and amorphous and may be reheated and stretch blow-molded to form a 1.5 liter returnable and refillable water bottle, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. The container <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is about 13.2 inches (335 mm) in height and about 3.6 inches (92 mm) in widest diameter. The container body has an open top end with a small diameter neck finish <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having external screw threads for receiving a screw cap (not shown), and a closed bottom end or base <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Between the neck finish <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a substantially vertically-disposed sidewall <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (defined by vertical axis or centerline CL of the bottle), including a substantially cylindrical panel portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a shoulder portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> tapering in diameter from panel <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to neck finish <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is a champagne-style base with a central gate portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and, moving radially outwardly towards the sidewall, an outwardly concave dome <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an inwardly concave chime <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and a radially increasing and arcuate outer base portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for a smooth transition to the sidewall panel <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The chime <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a substantially toroidal-shaped area around a standing ring (chime) on which the bottle rests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows in cross-section the multilayer panel portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which includes an inner sleeve layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (an expanded version of preform sleeve <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), and an outer layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (an expanded version of preform outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). One benefit of the present invention is that the layers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> have bonded and will not separate during reheat stretch blow molding or use of the container, in this case including the intended 20 or more refill cycles. In addition, a flange <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (same as flange <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the preform) forms a top sealing surface of the container with increased strength and thermal resistance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Second Preform Embodiment (Pasteurizable Beer) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D illustrate schematically a second method embodiment for making a finish-only sleeve and a multiple outer layer preform; this preform is adapted for making a pasteurizable beer container. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a core <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> positioned in a first mold cavity <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>; together they form a first molding chamber in which a finish-only sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is injection molded. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows an injection nozzle <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in the mold cavity <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, through which a molten thermoplastic material is injected for forming the sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the formed sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> on the core <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, the sleeve having been removed from first mold cavity <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> while it is still warm. The core <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> carrying the sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is then positioned in a second mold cavity <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. The second mold cavity <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and core <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> form a second molding chamber adapted to form an outer layer <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> over the inner sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. A plurality of different thermoplastic materials are injected through a gate <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the bottom of the second mold cavity <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, to form the multiple outer layers. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, the outer layer <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> extends the full length of the preform. A sequential injection process such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,516 to Krishnakumar et al., may be used to form inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> of virgin PET, core layer <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> of recycled PET (which may include an oxygen scavenging material), and inner and outer intermediate layers <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> of an oxygen barrier material, between the inner/core/outer layers. In this embodiment, only the virgin PET extends up into the neck finish of the preform, forming a single layer <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> over inner sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In the base of the preform, a final injection of virgin PET forms a plug <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> for clearing the nozzle before the next injection cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D illustrate a reciprocating shuttle apparatus, instead of the rotatable turret of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, which comprises a second apparatus embodiment. This second apparatus will now be described with respect to forming the preform of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a time line of the sequence of operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The apparatus (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D) includes first and second parallel guide bars <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on which a platen <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is movably mounted in the direction of arrow A<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The platen <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> carries a platform or shuttle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which is movable in a transverse direction across the platen <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> as shown by arrow A<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. A fixed platen <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at one end of the guide bars holds three injection mold cavity sets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> which are supplied by nozzles <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> respectively. The left (first) and right (third) cavity sets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are used to form neck portions of preforms, while the middle (second) cavity set <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is used for molding body-forming portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows an arbitrarily-designated first step wherein the first core set <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is positioned in left cavity set <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> for forming a first set of preform neck portions (sleeves). Simultaneously, second core set <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is positioned in middle cavity set <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for molding a set of multilayer body-forming portions (over a second set of previously molded neck portions). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the core sets following removal from the cavity sets, with a neck sleeve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> on each core of core set <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and a preform <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> on each core of core set <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The completed preforms <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are then ejected from the core set <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In a second step (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>), the shuttle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is moved to the right such that the first core set <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> with neck sleeves <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are now positioned below middle cavity <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, while second core set <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> with now empty cores <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is positioned below right cavity set <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>.

Again, body-forming portions are formed over the previously formed neck sleeves in middle cavity set <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, while neck sleeves are molded on each of the cores in the core set <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in right cavity set <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The movable platen <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is then retracted to remove the core sets from the cavity sets, the finished preforms on the first core set <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are ejected, and the shuttle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> returns to the left for molding the next set of layers. </paragraph>

First, at t&equals;0, the mold is closed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) and the pressure builds up. Then, at t&equals;1.5 seconds, the second cavity <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is filled (forming the outer layer), the pressure increased, and the pressure held while the preform cools, until t&equals;21 seconds. Meanwhile, no action is required in the first cavity at t&equals;1.5 seconds. at t&equals;20 seconds, the first cavity <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is filled with PEN polymer and the pressure increased and held until t&equals;21 seconds (again the hold and cooling stage has been substantially eliminated in the first cavity set by delaying the filling stage until near the end of the hold and cooling stage for the second cavity set). At t&equals;21 seconds, the mold is opened and the preforms <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are ejected from the second cavities.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this particular embodiment, the first and second core sets <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are held at a temperature on the order of 60-70&deg; C. during both of the first and second molding steps. The first mold cavity (for forming the neck finish sleeve) is on the order of 75-85&deg; C. The PEN polymer has a melt temperature on the order of 275-285&deg; C. The cycle time in the first cavity is on the order of 5-6 seconds; this is the time lapse between the first and second injection steps.

FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B show a multilayer preform <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B show a hot-fill beverage bottle <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> made from the preform of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, a first molded sleeve forms the entire thickness of the neck finish, and is joined at its lower end to a second molded body-forming portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a substantially cylindrical preform <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (defined by vertical centerline <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>) which includes an upper neck portion or finish sleeve <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> bonded to a lower body-forming portion <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The crystallized neck portion is a monolayer of CPET and includes an upper sealing surface <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> which defines the open top end <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> of the preform, and an exterior surface having threads <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> and a lowermost flange <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. CPET, sold by Eastman Chemical, Kingsport, Tenn., is a polyethylene terephthalate polymer with nucleating agents which cause the polymer to crystallize during the injection molding process. Below the neck finish <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is a body-forming portion <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> which includes a flared shoulder-forming section <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>, increasing (radially inwardly) in wall thickness from top to bottom, a cylindrical panel-forming section <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> having a substantially uniform wall thickness, and a base-forming section <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>. Body-forming section <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is substantially amorphous and is made of the following three layers in serial order: outer layer <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of virgin PET; core layer <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> of post-consumer PET; and inner layer <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> of virgin PET. The virgin PET is a low copolymer having 3% comonomers (e.g., cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM) or isophthalic acid (IPA)) by total weight of the copolymer. A last shot of virgin PET (to clean the nozzle) forms a core layer <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight> in the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This particular preform is designed for making a hot-fill beverage container. In this embodiment, the preform has a height of about 96.3 mm, and an outer diameter in the panel-forming section <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of about 26.7 mm. The total wall thickness at the panel-forming section <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is about 4 mm, and the thicknesses of the various layers are: outer layer <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of about 1 mm, core layer <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> of about 2 mm, and inner layer <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> of about 1 mm. The panel-forming section <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> may be stretched at an average planar stretch ratio of about 10:1, as described hereinafter. The planar stretch ratio is the ratio of the average thickness of the preform panel-forming portion <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> to the average thickness of the container panel <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, wherein the &ldquo;average&rdquo; is taken along the length of the respective preform or container portion. For hot-fill beverage bottles of about 0.5 to 2.0 liters in volume and about 0.35 to 0.60 millimeters in panel wall thickness, a preferred planar stretch ratio is about 9 to 12, and more preferably about 10 to 11. The hoop stretch is preferably about 3.3 to 3.8 and the axial stretch about 2.8 to 3.2. This produces a container panel with the desired abuse resistance, and a preform sidewall with the desired visual transparency. The specific panel thickness and stretch ratio selected depend on the dimensions of the bottle, the internal pressure, and the processing characteristics (as determined for example, by the intrinsic viscosity of the particular materials employed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In order to enhance the crystallinity of the neck portion, a high injection mold temperature is used at the first molding station. In this embodiment, CPET resin at a melt temperature of about 280 to 290&deg; C. is injection molded at a mold cavity temperature of about 110 to 120&deg; C. and a core temperature of about 5 to 15&deg; C., and a cycle time of about 6 to 7 seconds. The first core set, carrying the still warm neck portions (outer surface temperature of about 115 to 125&deg; C.), are then transferred to the second station where multiple second polymers are injected to form the multilayer body-forming portions and melt adhesion occurs between the neck and body-forming portions. The core and/or cavity set at the second station are cooled (e.g., 5 to 15&deg; C. core/cavity temperature) in order to solidify the performs and enable removal from the molds (cycle time of about 23 to 25 seconds) with acceptable levels of post-mold shrinkage. The cores and cavities at both the first and second stations include water cooling/heating passages for adjusting the temperature as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;melt adhesion&rdquo; between the inner sleeve and outer layer is meant to include various types of bonding which occur due to the enhanced temperature (at the outer surface of the inner sleeve) and pressure (e.g., typical injection molding on the order of 8,000-15,000 psi) during the second molding step, which may include diffusion, chemical, chain entanglement, hydrogen bonding, etc. Generally, diffusion and/or chain entanglement will be present to form a bond which prevents delamination of the layers in the preform, and in the container when filled with water at room temperature (25&deg; C.) and dropped from a height of eighteen inches onto a thick steel plate. </paragraph>

The container is about 182.0 mm in height and about 71.4 mm in (widest) diameter. This 16-oz. container is intended for use as a hot-fill non-carbonated juice container. The container has an open top end with the same crystallized neck finish <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> as the preform, with external screw threads <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> for receiving a screw-on cap (not shown). Below the neck finish <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is a substantially amorphous and transparent expanded body portion <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The body includes a substantially vertically-disposed sidewall <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> (defined by vertical centerline <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of the bottle) and base <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. The sidewall includes an upper flared shoulder portion <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> increasing in diameter to a substantially cylindrical panel portion <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> has a plurality of vertically-elongated, symmetrically-disposed vacuum panels <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>. The vacuum panels move inwardly to alleviate the vacuum formed during product cooling in the sealed container, and thus prevent permanent, uncontrolled deformation of the container. The base <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> is a champagne-style base having a recessed central gate portion <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> and moving radially outwardly toward the sidewall, an outwardly concave dome <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, an inwardly concave chime <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>, and a radially increasing and arcuate outer base portion <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> for a smooth transition to the sidewall <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Fourth Preform Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A fourth preform embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A multilayer preform <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is made from the method and apparatus of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is adapted to be reheat stretch blow-molded into a refillable carbonated beverage bottle similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but having a thickened base area including the chime for increased resistance to caustic and pressure induced stress cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> there is shown a preform <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which includes a PEN inner sleeve layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and a three-layer outer layer comprising outermost (exterior) virgin PET layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, first intermediate (interior) PC-PET layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and second intermediate (interior) virgin PET layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The inner sleeve layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is continuous, having a body portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> extending the full length of the preform and throughout the base. The sleeve layer further includes an upper flange <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which forms the top sealing surface of the preform. The outer layer similarly extends the full length and throughout the bottom of the preform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The preform <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes an upper neck finish <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a flared shoulder-forming section <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> which increases in thickness from top to bottom, a panel-forming section <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> having a uniform wall thickness, and a thickened base-forming section <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Base section <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> includes an upper cylindrical thickened portion <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> (of greater thickness than the panel section <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>) which forms a thickened chime in the container base, and a tapering lower portion <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of reduced thickness for forming a recessed dome in the container base. A last shot of virgin PET (to clean the nozzle) forms a core layer <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> in the base. A preform having a preferred cross-section for refill applications is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,528 granted Nov. 19, 1991 to Krishnakumar et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> This particular preform is designed for making a refillable carbonated beverage container. The use of an inner sleeve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a PEN homopolymer, copolymer, or blend provides reduced flavor absorption and increased thermal stability for increasing the wash temperature. The inner PEN sleeve can be made relatively thin according to the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The interior PC-PET layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be made relatively thick to reduce the cost of the container, without significantly affecting performance. In this example, the preform has a height of about 7.130 inches (181.1 mm), and an outer diameter in the panel-forming section <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of about 1.260 inches (32.0 mm). At the panel-forming section <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the total wall thickness is about 0.230 inches (5.84 mm), and the thicknesses of the various layers are: inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of about 0.040 inches (1.0 mm), outermost layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of about 0.040 inches (1.0 mm), first intermediate layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of about 0.130 inches (3.30 mm), and second intermediate layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of about 0.020 inches (0.5 mm). The panel-forming section <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be stretched at an average planar stretch ratio of about 10.5:1, as described hereinafter. The planar stretch ratio is the ratio of the average thickness of the preform panel-forming portion <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to the average thickness of the container panel (see for example sidewall <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), wherein the &ldquo;average&rdquo; is taken along the length of the respective preform or container portion. For refillable carbonated beverage bottles of about 0.5 to 2.0 liters in volume and about 0.5 to 0.8 millimeters in panel wall thickness, a preferred planar stretch ratio is about 7.5-10.5, and more preferably about 9.0-10.5. The hoop stretch is preferably about 3.2-3.5 and the axial stretch about 2.3-2.9. This produces a container panel with the desired abuse resistance, and a preform sidewall with the desired visual transparency. The specific panel thickness and stretch ratio selected depend on the dimensions of the bottle, the internal pressure (e.g., 2 atmospheres for beer and 4 atmospheres for soft drinks), and the processing characteristics (as determined for example, by the intrinsic viscosity of the particular materials employed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a thin PEN sleeve layer (e.g. 0.5 to 1.0 mm), a suitable mold cavity temperature would be on the order of 100 to 110&deg; C. and core temperature of about 5 to 15&deg; C., for a PET melt temperature of about 285 to 295&deg; C. and cycle time of about 6 to 7 seconds. The first core set and warm inner layer are then immediately transferred to the second station where the outer layers are injected and bonding occurs between the inner and outer layers (e.g., exterior surface of inner PEN sleeve layer at about 90 to 100&deg; C. and innermost PET layer at about 260 to 275&deg; C.). The first core set and/or second cavity set at the second station are cooled (e.g., about 5 to 15&deg; C.) in order to solidify the perform and enable removal from the mold. The cores and cavities at both the first and second stations include water cooling/heating passages for adjusting the temperature as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the inner sleeve layer 120 is made from a high-PEN copolymer having 90% PEN/10% PET by total weight of the layer, and in the container panel is about 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) thick. The outermost layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is a virgin PET low copolymer having 3% comonomers (e.g., CHDM or IPA), and in the container panel is about 0.004 in (0.10 mm) thick. The first intermediate layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is PC-PET, and in the container panel is about 0.012 in (0.30 mm) thick. The second intermediate layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is the same virgin PET low copolymer as outermost layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and in the container panel is about 0.002 in (0.05 mm) thick. The container shoulder and base (see <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) are stretched less and therefore are thicker and less oriented than the panel (see <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> There are numerous preform and container constructions, and many different injection moldable materials, which may be adapted for a particular food product and/or package, filling, and manufacturing process. Additional representative examples are given below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Thermoplastic polymers useful in the present invention include polyesters, polyamides and polycarbonates. Suitable polyesters include homopolymers, copolymers or blends of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polypropylene terephthalate (PPT), polyethylene napthalate (PEN), and a cyclohexane dimethanol/PET copolymer, known as PETG (available from Eastman Chemical, Kingsport, Tenn.). Suitable polyamides (PA) include PA6, PA6,6, PA6,4, PA6,10, PA11, PA12, etc. Other useful thermoplastic polymers include acrylic/imide, amorphous nylon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polystyrene, crystallizable nylon (MXD-6), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Polyesters based on terephthalic or isophthalic acid are commercially available and convenient. The hydroxy compounds are typically ethylene glycol and 1,4-di-(hydroxy methyl)-cyclohexane. The intrinsic viscosity for phthalate polyesters are typically in the range of 0.6 to 1.2, and more particularly 0.7 to 1.0 (for O-chlorolphenol solvent). 0.6 corresponds approximately to a viscosity average molecular weight of 59,000, and 1.2 to a viscosity average molecular weight of 112,000. In general, the phthalate polyester may include polymer linkages, side chains, and end groups not related to the formal precursors of a simple phthalate polyester previously specified. Conveniently, at least 90 mole percent will be terephthalic acid and at least 90 mole percent an aliphatic glycol or glycols, especially ethylene glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Post-consumer PET (PC-PET) is a type of recycled PET prepared from PET plastic containers and other recyclables that are returned by consumers for a recycling operation, and has now been approved by the FDA for use in certain food containers. PC-PET is known to have a certain level of I.V. (intrinsic viscosity), moisture content, and contaminants. For example, typical PC-PET (having a flake size of one-half inch maximum), has an I.V. average of about 0.66 dl/g, a relative humidity of less than 0.25%, and the following levels of contaminants: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> aluminum: &lt;50 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> olefin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, PP): &lt;500 ppm </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> colored PET: &lt;2000 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> other contaminants: &lt;500 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> PC-PET may be used alone or in one or more layers for reducing the cost or for other benefits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Also useful as a base polymer or as a thermal resistant and/or high-oxygen barrier layer is a packaging material with physical properties similar to PET, namely polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). PEN provides a 3-5&times; improvement in barrier property and enhanced thermal resistance, at some additional expense. Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) is a polyester produced when dimethyl 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate (NDC) is reacted with ethylene glycol. The PEN polymer comprises repeating units of ethylene 2,6 naphthalate. PEN resin is available having an inherent viscosity of 0.67 dl/g and a molecular weight of about 20,000 from Amoco Chemical Company, Chicago, Ill. PEN has a glass transition temperature T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of about 123&deg; C., and a melting temperature T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of about 267&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Oxygen barrier layers include ethylene/vinyl alcohol (EVOH), PEN, polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polyvinyldene chloride (PVDC), nylon 6, crystallizable nylon (MXD-6), LCP (liquid crystal polymer), amorphous nylon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and styrene acrylonitrile (SAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) effects the processability of the resins. Polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.8 is widely used in the carbonated soft drink (CSD) industry. Polyester resins for various applications may range from about 0.55 to about 1.04, and more particularly from about 0.65 to 0.85dl/g. Intrinsic viscosity measurements of polyester resins are made according to the procedure of ASTM D-2857, by employing 0.0050&plusmn;0.0002 g/ml of the polymer in a solvent comprising o-chlorophenol (melting point 0&deg; C.), respectively, at 30&deg; C. Intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) is given by the following formula: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>Soln. </subscript></highlight>is the viscosity of the solution in any units; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>Sol. </subscript></highlight>is the viscosity of the solvent in the same units; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> C is the concentration in grams of polymer per 100 mls of solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The blown container body should be substantially transparent. One measure of transparency is the percent haze for transmitted light through the wall (H<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>) which is given by the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>H</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&lsqb;Y</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>&divide;(<highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;Y</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> where Y<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is the diffuse light transmitted by the specimen, and Y<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is the specular light transmitted by the specimen. The diffuse and specular light transmission values are measured in accordance with ASTM Method D 1003, using any standard color difference meter such as model D25D3P manufactured by Hunterlab, Inc. The container body should have a percent haze (through the panel wall) of less than about 10%, and more preferably less than about 5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The preform body-forming portion should also be substantially amorphous and transparent, having a percent haze across the wall of no more than about 10%, and more preferably no more than about 5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The container will have varying levels of crystallinity at various positions along the height of the bottle from the neck finish to the base. The percent crystallinity may be determined according to ASTM 1505 as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>% crystallinity&equals;&lsqb;(<highlight><italic>ds&minus;da</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>dc&minus;da</italic></highlight>)&rsqb;&times;100 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> where ds&equals;sample density in g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, da&equals;density of an amorphous film of zero percent crystallinity, and dc&equals;density of the crystal calculated from unit cell parameters. The panel portion of the container is stretched the greatest and preferably has an average percent crystallinity in at least the outer layer of at least about 15%, and more preferably at least about 20%. For primarily PET polymers, a 15-25% crystallinity range is useful in refill and hot-fill applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Further increases in crystallinity can be achieved by heat setting to provide a combination of strain-induced and thermal-induced crystallization. Thermal-induced crystallinity is achieved at low temperatures to preserve transparency, e.g., holding the container in contact with a low temperature blow mold. In some applications, a high level of crystallinity at the surface of the sidewall alone is sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As a further alternative embodiment, the preform may include one or more layers of an oxygen scavenging material. Suitable oxygen scavenging materials are described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/355,703 filed Dec. 14, 1994 by Collette et al., entitled &ldquo;Oxygen Scavenging Composition For Multilayer Preform And Container,&rdquo; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As disclosed therein, the oxygen scavenger may be a metal-catalyzed oxidizable organic polymer, such as a polyamide, or an anti-oxidant such as phosphite or phenolic. The oxygen scavenger may be mixed with PC-PET to accelerate activation of the scavenger. The oxygen scavenger may be advantageously combined with other thermoplastic polymers to provide the desired injection molding and stretch blow molding characteristics for making substantially amorphous injection molded preforms and substantially transparent biaxially oriented polyester containers. The oxygen scavenger may be provided as an interior layer to retard migration of the oxygen scavenger or its byproducts, and to prevent premature activation of the scavenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Refillable containers must fulfill several key performance criteria in order to achieve commercial viability, including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> 1. high clarity (transparency) to permit visual on-line inspection; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> 2. dimensional stability over the life of the container; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> 3. resistance to caustic wash induced stress cracking and leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Generally, a refillable plastic bottle must maintain its functional and aesthetic characteristics over a minimum of 10 and preferably 20 cycles or loops to be economically feasible. A cycle is generally comprised of (1) an empty hot caustic wash, (2) contaminant inspection (before and/or after wash) and product filling/capping, (3) warehouse storage, (4) distribution to wholesale and retail locations and (5) purchase, use and empty storage by the consumer, followed by eventual return to the bottler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A test procedure for simulating such a cycle would be as follows. As used in this specification and claims, the ability to withstand a designated number of refill cycles without crack failure and/or with a maximum volume change is determined according to the following test procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Each container is subjected to a typical commercial caustic wash solution prepared with 3.5% sodium hydroxide by weight and tap water. The wash solution is maintained at a designated wash temperature, e.g., 60&deg; C. The bottles are submerged uncapped in the wash for 15 minutes to simulate the time/temperature conditions of a commercial bottle wash system. After removal from the wash solution, the bottles are rinsed in tap water and then filled with a carbonated water solution at 4.0&plusmn;0.2 atmospheres (to simulate the pressure in a carbonated soft drink container), capped and placed in a 38&deg; C. convection oven at 50% relative humidity for 24 hours. This elevated oven temperature is selected to simulate longer commercial storage periods at lower ambient temperatures. Upon removal from the oven, the containers are emptied and again subjected to the same refill cycle, until failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A failure is defined as any crack propagating through the bottle wall which results in leakage and pressure loss. Volume change is determined by comparing the volume of liquid the container will hold at room temperature, both before and after each refill cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A refillable container can preferably withstand at least 20 refill cycles at a wash temperature of 60&deg; C. without failure, and with no more than 1.5% volume change after 20 cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this invention, a higher level of crystallization can be achieved in the neck finish compared to prior art processes which crystallize outside the mold. Thus, the preform neck finish may have a level of crystallinity of at least about 30%. As a further example, a neck finish made of a PET homopolymer can be molded with an average percent crystallinity of at least about 35%, and more preferably at least about 40% To facilitate bonding between the neck portion and body-forming portion of the preform, one may use a thread split cavity, wherein the thread section of the mold is at a temperature above 60&deg; C., and preferably above 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As an additional benefit, a colored neck finish can be produced, while maintaining a transparent container body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The neck portion can be monolayer or multilayer and made of various polymers other than CPET, such as arylate polymers, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polycarbonates, polypropylene, polyimides, polysulfones, acrylonitrile styrene, etc. As a further alternative, the neck portion can be made of a regular bottle-grade homopolymer or low copolymer PET (i.e., having a low crystallization rate), but the temperature or other conditions of the first molding station can be adjusted to crystallize the neck portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Other benefits include the achievement of higher hot-fill temperatures (i.e., above 85&deg; C.) because of the increased thermal resistance of the finish, and higher refill wash temperatures (i.e., above 60&deg; C.). The increased thermal resistance is also particularly useful in pasteurizable containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B illustrate graphically the change in melt temperature and orientation temperature for PET/PEN compositions, as the weight percent of PEN increases from 0 to 100. There are three classes of PET/PEN copolymers or blends: (a) a high-PEN concentration having on the order of 80-100% PEN and 0-20% PET by total weight of the copolymer or blend, which is a strain-hardenable (orientable) and crystallizable material; (b) a mid-PEN. concentration having on the order of 20-80% PEN and 80-20% PET, which is an amorphous non-crystallizable material that will not undergo strain hardening; and (c) a low-PEN concentration having on the order of 1-20% PEN and 80-99% PET, which is a crystallizable and strain-hardenable material. A particular PEN/PET polymer or blend can be selected from FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B based on the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a particular embodiment of a combined infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF) heating system for reheating previously molded and cooled preforms (i.e., for use in a two-stage reheat injection mold and stretch blow process). This system is intended for reheating preforms having layers with substantially different orientation temperatures. For example, in the fourth preform embodiment the high-PEN inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has an orientation temperature much higher than the virgin PET low copolymer and PC-PET outer layers <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. PEN homopolymer has a minimum orientation temperature on the order of 260&deg; F. (127&deg; C.), based on a glass transition temperature on the order of 255&deg; F. (123&deg; C.). PEN homopolymer has a preferred orientation range of about 270-295&deg; F. (132-146&deg; C.). In contrast, PET homopolymer has a glass transition temperature on the order of 175&deg; F. (80&deg; C.). At the minimum orientation temperature of PEN homopolymer, PET homopolymer would begin to crystallize and would no longer undergo strain hardening (orientation), and the resulting container would be opaque and have insufficient strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, this combined reheating apparatus may be used with preforms having a substantial disparity in orientation temperatures between layers. The preforms <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are held at the upper neck finish by a collet <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and travel along an endless chain <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through stations A, B and C in serial order. Station A is a radiant heating oven in which the preforms are rotated while passing by a series of quartz heaters. The heating of each preform is primarily from the exterior surface and heat is transmitted across the wall to the inner layer. The resulting heat or temperature profile is higher at the exterior surface of the preform than at the interior surface. The time and temperature may be adjusted in an attempt to equilibriate the temperature across the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is desired to heat the inner PEN layer at a higher temperature because of PEN&apos;s higher orientation temperature. Thus, the preforms (across the wall) are brought up to an initial temperature of about 160&deg; F. (71&deg; C.) at station A, and are then transferred to station B which utilizes microwave or radio frequency heaters. These high-frequency dielectric heaters provide a reverse temperature profile from that of the quartz heaters, with the interior surface of the preform being heated to a higher temperature than that of the exterior surface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the preforms <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> traveling between electrode plates <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, which are connected to RF generator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and ground respectively. At station B, the inner layer is brought up to a temperature of about 295&deg; F. (146&deg; C.), and the outer layer to a temperature of about 200&deg; F. (93&deg; C.). Finally, the preforms are passed to station C, which is similar to station A. At station C the quartz heaters bring the preforms to a temperature of about 280&deg; F. (138&deg; C.) at the inner layer and about 210&deg; F. (99&deg; C.) at the outer layer. The reheated preforms are then sent to a blow mold for stretch blow molding. A more detailed description of hybrid reheating of polyester preforms including a combination of quartz oven reheating and radio frequency reheating is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,513 to Collette entitled &ldquo;Method Of Reheating Preforms For Forming Blow Molded Hot Fillable Containers,&rdquo; which issued Mar. 15, 1988, and is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, additives may be provided in either or both of the PET and PEN layers to make them more receptive to radio frequency heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In a preferred thin sleeve/thick outer layer embodiment, the thin inner layer sleeve may have a thickness on the order of 0.02 to 0.06 inch (0.5 to 1.5 mm), while the thick outer layer has a wall thickness on the order of 0.10 to 0.25 inch (2.50 to 6.35 mm). The inner layer may comprise on the order of 10-20% by total weight of the preform. This represents an improvement over the prior art single injection cavity process for making multilayer preforms. Also, the weight of one or more outer layers (such as a layer of PC-PET) can be maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> While there have been shown and described several embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appending claims. </paragraph>
