<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a novel method for producing nucleoside derivatives, more precisely to a novel method for producing nucleoside derivatives including 9-(2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro-&bgr;-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)adenine (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;FddA&rdquo;) and its related compounds which are useful as anti-viral agents, to novel intermediates in the method, and to a novel method for producing the intermediates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is reported that 9-(2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro-&bgr;-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)adenine (FddA) has a strong anti-viral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is greatly effective for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (see V. E. Marquetz, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., (36) page 2719, 1987; P. Herdewijn, et al., J. Med. Chem., (30), page 2131, 1987), and many clinical tests using it for the treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related complications (ARC) are being made at present. Recently, in addition, reported are FddA derivatives as modified at the nucleic acid base site to improve their potency (see C. K. Chu, et al., J. Med. Chem., (37), page 821,1994; J. S. Driscoll, et al., J. Med. Chem., (39), page 1619, 1996; C. K. Chu, et al., J. Med. Chem., (39), page 4676, 1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The most direct method for producing FddA and its related compounds comprises substituting a substrate, of which the 3&prime;-position in the saccharide moiety is deoxylated, at its 2&prime;-position (see P. Herdewijn, et al., J. Med. Chem., (30), page 2131, 1987; V. E. Marquez, et al., J. Med. Chem., (33), page 978, 1990; H. Shiragami, et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, (11), page 391, 1992). However, the yield in the conventional methods is extremely low or is not higher than 10% and the reagent, diethylaminosulfer trifuluoride (DAST), is not available in industrial amount, and therefore the methods could not be used for industrial production of FddA and its related compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 1. Problems to be Solved by the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the course of the completion to the present invention, the above and following problems in the related art have been also found by the present inventors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Given the situation as above, it is desired to develop an inexpensive method for producing nucleoside derivatives including 9-(2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro-&bgr;-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)adenine (FddA) and its related compounds, in a simplified manner and at a high yield, in particular, an economical and industrial method for producing those nucleoside derivatives that comprises substituting a substrate, of which the 3&prime;-position of the saccharide moiety is deoxylated, at its 2&prime;-position at a high yield. Accordingly, the subject matter in the art is to provide such an excellent production method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to develop an advantageous method for producing the nucleoside derivatives noted above, especially those having anti-viral activity, and to provide intermediates in the method and also a simple method for producing the intermediates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> We, the present inventors have assiduously studied in order to solve the problems noted above, and, as a result, have found, in a process for producing nucleoside derivatives including 9-(2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro-&bgr;-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)adenine (FddA) and its related compounds, by subjecting a 3&prime;-deoxy derivative of adenine to 2&prime;-deoxylation/substitution with a flurine atom or the like (see P. herdewijn, et al., J. Med. Chem.,(30), page 2131, 1987; V. E. Marquez, et al., J. Med. Chem., (33), page 978, 1990; H. Shiragami, et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, (11), page 391, 1992), the yield thereof is extremely low mainly due to a rearrangement of adenine base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is reported that, by subjecting a derivative of adenine, of which the 3&prime;-position is not deoxylated, to 2&prime;-deoxylation/substitution with a fluorine atom or the like, the same kind of rearrangement has occurred as side reaction and lowered the yield (see K. A. Watanabe, et al., J. Org. Chem., (57), page 553, 1992). Furthermore, it is reported that, by chlorination at the 6-position of the nucleic acid, this kind of rearrangement can be suppressed (see T. Maruyama, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., (44), page 2331, 1996). However, it is not known the case of 3&prime;-deoxy derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, we, the present inventors have produced novel intermediates of a general formula (1) mentioned below, which are derivatives as deoxylated at the 3&prime;-position and substituted by a halogen atom at the 6-position of the nucleic acid. Using those novel intermediates, we have found that even substrates, of which the 3&prime;-position of the nucleic acid is deoxylated, can suppress the troblesome rearrangement completely and can be substituted at the 2&prime;-position at an extremely high yield. On the basis of these findings, we have completed the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Specifically, by subjecting a 3&prime;-deoxy derivative of inosine to 6-halogenation step for halogenating it at the 6-position thereof to give a 6-halide of the derivative, and then subjecting it to 2&prime;-deoxylation/substitution with a fluorine atom or the like, followed by further subjecting it to substitution with an amino group, a hydroxyl group or any other intended substituent at the 6-positioned halogen atom, we have made it possible to produce the intended nucleoside derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> On the basis of our findings noted above, hereinunder illustrated is one embodiment of the production route to give nucleoside derivatives, which covers all the steps in series as concretely demonstrated in Examples to be mentioned hereinafter. All those steps and the compounds as produced therein are usable in the process of producing nucleoside derivatives of the present invention. Naturally, the invention encompasses not only all the steps constituting this production route but also any and every method comprising any one of those steps, novel intermediates as produced in those steps and even the use of those novel intermediates, especially the use thereof for producing various nucleoside derivatives. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Modes of carrying out the invention are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (7) noted above, such as typically 9-(2,5-di-O-acetyl-3-bromo-3-deoxy-&bgr;-D-xylofuranosyl)adenine, which are used in the invention, can be produced with ease in accordance with known methods (for example, see J. G. Moffatt, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., (95), page 4025, 1973). The substituent W is a halogen atom such as bromine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The hydroxyl-protecting group, R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>includes, for example, an acyl group (having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms), such as acetyl or benzoyl; an aralkyl group such as benzyl; and an alkyl group (having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms), such as allyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (4) noted above for use in the invention can be obtained by de-halogenating the compounds of formula (7). To de-halogenate them, employable is any per-se known de-halogenating method, but preferred is a method of reducing the compound (7) with a radical reaction reagent, such as tri-n-butyl tin hydride, tris(trimethylsilyl)silane, diphenylsilane or diphenylmethylsilane in the presence of a radical reaction initiator such as azobisisobutyronitrile; or a method of reducing it with hydrogen in the presence of a reduction catalyst such as palladium-carbon or Raney nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The compounds of formula (4) for use in the invention can also be obtained in any per-se known method (for example, a method for producing them from compounds of formula (7), such as that described by H. Shiragami et al., in Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, (15), page 31, 1996). For example, 3&prime;-deoxyinosine is prepared and any hydroxyl groups of the compound are protected to give the intended compound (4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (5) noted above for use in the invention have a halogen atom (e.g., chlorine) at the 6-position, and these are preferably obtained by halogenating a compound of formula (4) selectively at its 6-position with a halogenating agent. The halogenating agent includes, for example, a chlorinating agent of a combination of phosphorus oxychloride and N,N-dimethylaniline or a combination of sulfuryl chloride and dimethylformamide, and a chlorinating agent of dimethylchloromethyleneammonium chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (6) noted above for use in the invention can be obtained by de-protecting the compounds of formula (5). For the de-protection, preferably used is a mild method that may have no influence on the 6-halogen atom of the compounds (5). For example, compounds of formula (5) wherein X is a chlorine atom and R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is an acyl group, can be easily de-protected with ammonia or sodium methoxide as dissolved in an alcohol, such as methanol, without being influenced at the chlorine atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formulae (5) and (6) noted above for use in the invention may be produced in per-se known methods (for example, see C. K. Chu et al., WO-9709052 (1997); Frederick William Hurry et al., Japanese Patent Kokoku Publication JP-B-42-17903), or that is, by coupling the nucleic acid base moiety and the saccharide moiety. In general, however, the known methods produce mixtures with unnecessary &agr;-anomers, and therefore indispensably require the separation of the intended products from the mixtures. In addition, the yield of the intended products to be produced in the known methods is low. Therefore, the method of the invention that uses compounds (4) is preferred, as being easy and economical in industrial production of the compounds (5) and (6). The invention encompasses those compounds (4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (1) noted above, which the invention encompasses, can be produced by reacting the compound of formula (6) with a reagent capable of selectively protecting the 5&prime;-position of the nucleosides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In formula (1), R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>is a protective group for the hydroxyl group, which may or may not be substituted (for example, with a halogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an alkyloxy group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, etc.), and the protective group includes, for example, an acyl group such as acetyl or benzoyl; an alkyl group such as methoxymethyl or allyl; an aralkyl group such as benzyl or triphenylmethyl; a silyl group such as trimethylsilyl. As the reagent that gives such a protective group, for example, preferably used is any of an acylating agent, an alkylating agent, an aralkylating agent and an organic silylating agent. The acylating agent includes, for example, acid anhydrides such as acetic anhydride and benzoic anhydride, and acid halides such as acyl chloride and benzoyl chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The alkylating agent includes, for example, alkyl halides such as chloromethyl methyl ether and allyl bromide. The aralkylating agent includes, for example, aralkyl halides such as benzyl bromide and triphenylmethyl chloride. The organic silylating agent includes, for example, organic silyl halides such as trimethylsilyl chloride. The reaction of the compound (6) with the protecting reagent is preferably effected in the presence of a base. The base usable in the reaction includes, for example, hydroxylamine, ammonia and their salts; primary to quaternary amines and their salts; metal hydroxides such as barium hydroxide; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and potassium methoxide; lithium-ammonia solution; ion exchange resins; carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate; phosphates such as disodium phosphate; acetates such as sodium acetate; and alkaline solutions of sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Regarding the reaction condition, the two may be reacted in a suitable solvent. As the solvent, preferably used is an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, toluene, methylene chloride or methanol. The reaction solvent may be or may not be dewatered. Anyhow, after the reaction, the base, if used, in the reaction mixture is optionally neutralized, and the product formed can be isolated from the mixture through ordinary extraction using an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, toluene or methylene chloride. Apart from this, the reaction mixture may be directly subjected to the next step without isolating the product therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Compounds of formula (1) wherein R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>are the same, for example, R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&boxH;R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;acetyl or benzoyl, may be obtained by de-protecting the compound of formula (5) selectively at the 2&prime;-protective group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Of compounds of formula (2) noted above, the hydrogen atom in the 2&prime;-hydroxyl group is substituted with a sulfonic acid-type leaving group (SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 400 g (1.49 mols) of inosine was suspended in 800 ml of acetic acid in a 2-liter glass reactor, to which was added 240 ml (1.92 mols) of trimethyl ortho-acetate, and reacted at 35&deg; C. for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure while acetic acid was added thereto, to thereby remove almost all methanol therefrom. The resulting concentrate was dissolved in 900 ml of acetonitrile added thereto, and cooled at 0&deg; C., to which was dropwise and slowly added 280 ml (3.79 mols) of acetyl bromide over a period of about 5 hours. The resulting white slurry was dropwise added to 1.6 liters of a 1/1 mixture of water and acetonitrile that had been prepared separately, while being neutralized with an aqueous solution of 25% sodium hydroxide, whereby the reaction was stopped. The neutralizing rate was so adjusted that the pH value of the system might fall between 6.0 and 7.0 or so. For this neutralization, used was about 1.3 liters of the aqueous solution of 25% sodium hydroxide. To the resulting reaction mixture, added was 800 ml of acetonitrile to separate the organic layer and the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was back-extracted with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined and concentrated to have a desired volume, and then washed with a saturated saline solution and an aqueous saturated solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent was evaporated out from the resulting filtrate, and a syrupy product was obtained. This was analyzed through liquid chromatography. The yield of the entitled compound was 53.8%. </paragraph>
