<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A cooking apparatus includes a container, a spigot, a lid, and a food support. The container has a bottom surface and a side wall that extends upwardly from the bottom surface to a top edge of the side wall. The spigot is attached to the container side wall and has a valve member that is selectively positionable between opened and closed positions. The spigot valve member allows liquid contents of the container to drain from the container when in the opened position, and prevents the contents from draining out of the container when in the closed position. The food support is comprised of a perforated horizontal member with a perforated side wall extending upwardly from the horizontal member. A plurality of vertical members spaced around the periphery of the horizontal member extend upwardly from the horizontal member. The food support is dimensioned to fit within the interior of the container and some of the vertical members have top ends with integral support connectors that are adapted to engage with the side wall top edge to suspend the food support in a spaced relation from the container bottom surface. The lid has a handle and lid connectors that are complementary to and selectively connectable to the support connectors. The lid connectors can selectively connect with the food support and allow the food support to be lifted by the lid and lowered into or removed from the container. The lid shields the user from the hot contents of the container when the food support is lowered into or removed from the container. The lid top and bottom surfaces slant downwardly as the lid top and bottom surfaces extends inwardly from the lid peripheral edge toward the center of the lid. The slanting forms a central depression in the lid which promotes liquid accumulated on the lid bottom surface to drip from the apex of the central depression. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> (i) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to cooking apparatus, and specifically to cooking apparatus designed for deep frying of poultry and other food items and for steaming or boiling food items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (ii) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typical deep frying food cooking apparatus (deep fryers) include a container in which oil is heated and a basket or food support on which food items are placed and then lowered into the heated oil in the container to be cooked. Prior art fryers include large fryers for cooking large items such as turkeys, which often have their own support stand and heat source, and smaller fryers for cooking smaller items that can be used on a kitchen stove top or countertop. When deep frying large food items, such as turkeys or other poultry items, or smaller items such as trench fries, vegetables or fish, the user is exposed to the danger of large amounts of oil at very high temperatures, typically 350&deg; F. or more. When inserting frozen food items or items that contain moisture into deep fryers containing hot oil, the high temperature oil causes the moisture to flash off the food items and thereby creates bubbling and turbulence within the hot oil which causes the hot oil to spatter, potentially burning the user of the fryer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typical prior art deep fryers include baskets with a handle that extends outward from the periphery of the basket so that a user may insert the basket into and remove the basket from the deep fryer with minimal exposure to the dangers of the spattering hot oil. The large prior art turkey or poultry fryers typically utilize a flat plate like food support which do not have the same outwardly extending handle of smaller fryers. Because of the large size of turkeys and poultry items and their associated weight, such a handle would not always provide a secure grip on the food support when inserting or removing the food support into or out of the hot oil. Therefore, the large prior art turkey and poultry fryer food supports typically have a center post that extends upwardly from the center of the food support to a top end of the post that is adapted to be connected to a handle of some type for inserting and removing the food support into and out of the hot oil. Typically, the center post also serves as a skewer upon which the turkey or poultry items are inserted so as to hold the turkey and poultry items in a centered orientation during the cooking process. These handle assemblies of prior art turkey and poultry fryers expose the user to the dangers of the spattering hot oil. Specifically, because the food supports are inserted and removed from the hot oil container by a handle that attaches to the center post of the food support, the user&apos;s hand(s) and arm(s) are exposed to the spattering hot oil when inserting the food into and when removing the food from the deep fryer. Therefore, these prior art fryers require the user to wear protective clothing such as long sleeve shirts and gloves and/or gloves with extended gauntlets to avoid the possibility of being burned by the hot oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typical food steaming or boiling apparatus (food steamers) include a container for heating and boiling water and a basket for supporting food items to be boiled or steamed in the container. The basket typically has a handle that extends across the top of the basket and, like the prior art turkey fryers, exposes the user to hot steam or boiling water when inserting or removing the basket from the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When steaming food or frying turkeys, it is desirable, for proper cooking, to keep the food off of the bottom surface of the container. To accomplish this, prior art turkey and poultry fryers typically utilize a food support that has legs extending downwardly from the bottom of the food support. The legs serve to position the food support and the turkey in a spaced relation from the bottom of the fryer container within which the turkey and the food support are placed. Likewise, prior art food steamers also often provide a basket that has legs extending downwardly from the bottom of the basket. The disadvantage of having legs extending downwardly from the bottom of the food support/basket is that the user may, when inserting or removing the food support/basket from the fryer/steamer, mistakenly believe that the entire food support/basket has cleared the upper most part of the container, when in fact, a leg is still extending into the container or extending outside of the container. This exposes the user to the danger that a leg of the food support may catch on a lip or side wall of the container and cause the food support/basket to tip and possibly spilling its food contents, or worse knock over the container and expose the user to the dangers of the spilled hot liquid of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Prior art fryers and food steamers do not provide a means of draining the liquid contents from the container. To remove the liquid contents from the container, typical prior art fryers and food steamers require the user to pour the liquid contents of the container out of the top of the container, much like pouring water from a bucket. This method of removing the liquid contents of the container exposes the user to the dangers of spilling the contents and, if still hot, burning anyone who comes in contact with the spilled liquid. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of prior art fryers and food steamers by providing a cooking apparatus that minimizes the user&apos;s exposure to the hot contents of the cooking apparatus. The cooking apparatus of the present invention includes a food support that does not have legs extending downwardly from the food support and, therefore, does not expose the user to the potential dangers associated with the support legs protruding below the food support discussed above. Furthermore, the present invention also provides a cooking apparatus container with a spigot that allows the liquid contents to be safely drained without requiring the container to be tipped on its side to pour out the liquid contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a cooking apparatus is provided that is adapted to be utilized with existing cooking containers that are suitable for high temperature heating of the desired cooking medium, such as oil or water. The cooking apparatus is dimensioned so that it may be easily inserted into and removed from the cooking container. The cooking apparatus includes a food support that has a horizontal member which is adapted for receiving and supporting food items placed thereon. Extending upwardly from the horizontal member is at least one vertical member having a top end. The top end has a support connector which is designed to be utilized to suspend the food support in the cooking container. A lid is provided that has a handle and a lid connector. The lid connector is complementary to and selectively connectable to the support connector. The user can selectively engage the lid connector with the support connector and use the lid to lift the food support and suspend the food support from the lid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By utilizing a lid having a lid connector that is selectively connectable to the support connector, the user may insert or remove the food support from the cooking container using the lid. The lid provides protection for the user from the spattering of the hot liquid contents of the cooking container. The cooking apparatus of the invention thereby overcomes disadvantages of prior art fryers and food steamers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a cooking apparatus is provided with both a container and a food support. The container has a bottom surface and a side wall that extends upwardly from the container bottom surface to a top edge of the side wall. The container bottom surface and side wall define an interior of the container which is capable of holding the desired cooking medium, i.e. water or oil. The container is further capable of being heated to a high temperature for the cooking of food. The food support has a horizontal member which is adapted for supporting food items placed thereon. Extending upwardly from the horizontal member is at least one vertical member. The at least one vertical member has a support connector on it. However, in this embodiment, the support connector is designed and adapted to engage with the top edge of the container side wall and the container side wall top edge is adapted to engage with the support connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The at least one vertical member is dimensioned so that when the food support is placed within the container interior, the support connector engages with the side wall top edge and the horizontal member is suspended in a spaced relation from the bottom surface of the container. By having the support connector engage with the side wall top edge in order to suspend the food support in a spaced relation from the container bottom surface, the necessity of having legs extending downwardly below the horizontal member is eliminated. Therefore, the present invention overcomes the previously discussed disadvantages of the prior art fryers and food steamers having food supports with legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This embodiment can also be provided with a lid for the container which has lid connectors on the lid. The lid connectors are adapted to be selectively connectable to the support connectors. This allows the food support to be inserted into and removed from the container interior by the lid, providing all the protective benefits of a lid, as mentioned above. Alternatively, the food support of the cooking apparatus can be raised and lowered by a pair of grab hooks of the type used in the prior art. The grab hooks can be selectively connectable to the support connector engaged over the side wall of the container. This enables the user to lower the food support into or remove the food support from the container interior while with minimal exposure to the hot contents of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the cooking apparatus includes a spigot attached to the container side wall and in communication with the container interior. The spigot has a valve member and a spout. The valve member is selectively positionable between an opened position and a closed position relative to the spigot. The spout is in communication with the spigot when the valve member is in the open position, thereby opening a flow path from the container interior through the spigot and the spout. When the valve member is in the closed position the spout is not in communication with the spigot and the valve member effectively closes the flow path from the container interior through the spigot and the spout. By having a spigot attached to the container side wall communicating with the container interior, the liquid content of the container can be selectively drained from the container interior in a controlled fashion. The use of the spigot overcomes the prior art disadvantage of requiring the contents of the container to be dumped or poured out of the container by tipping the container horizontally, much like pouring water out of a bucket. The spigot thereby reduces the dangers associated with removing hot liquid contents from the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the spigot is provided with a stop which is connected to the spigot and extends outwardly from the spigot around the valve member. The stop is dimensioned and adapted to limit movement of the valve member beyond the opened position, and thereby prevents the valve member from being removed from the spigot which would result in uncontrolled discharge of the hot container contents through the spigot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the cooking apparatus includes a container and a lid. The container has a bottom surface and a side wall that extends upwardly from the container bottom surface to a top edge of the side wall. The container bottom surface and side wall define an interior of the container which is capable of holding the desired cooking medium, i.e. water or oil. The container is further capable of being heated to a high temperature for the cooking of food. The lid is dimension to fit over the container side wall top edge and has a handle. The lid also has a peripheral edge, a vertical central axis and opposite top and bottom surfaces. The top and bottom lid surfaces slant downwardly as the top and bottom lid surfaces extend radially inwardly from the peripheral edge toward the vertical central axis and form a central depression in the lid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By utilizing a lid with a central depression, the lid provides a point for any liquids that accumulate on the lid bottom surface to drip off of the lid. The drip point promotes the removal of liquids from the lid bottom surface and into the container when the lid is on or above the container and minimizes the possibility of uncontrolled liquid dripping off of the lid bottom surface in undesirable locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art fryers and food steamers.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As used herein, words such as &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; and &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; are not intended to be strictly construed in describing the invention. A &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; member could have only a general horizontal configuration and a &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; member could have only a general vertical configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the cooking apparatus, generally indicated as <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of the invention. The cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is basically comprised of a lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, each of the component parts of the apparatus are constructed of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is generally circular and has opposite top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a center projection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a peripheral edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a handle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to fit on the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The lid top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> slant downwardly as the lid top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extend radially inwardly from the peripheral edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward the center projection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The slanting of the lid top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> form a central depression <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The central depression <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the center projection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are adapted to promote liquid on the lid bottom surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to flow by gravity downwardly along the lid bottom surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and toward the center projection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> where the liquid will drip off of the lid bottom surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also has a rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that extends downwardly from the peripheral edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> beyond the lid bottom surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The lid rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends around most of the peripheral edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the lid but is interrupted by a pair of notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the rim on opposite sides of the lid. The notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the lid rim are adapted to accommodate portions of the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a manner yet to be described, while still providing a good fit between the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> also allow steam or vapor to exit the container through the notches while cooking. Although, when using the cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to deep fry poultry, the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is typically not left on the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the poultry is being cooked. The handle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed from a single metal rod. The handle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed in a generally rectangular shape at the middle of the rod and the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed as J-shaped hooks at opposite ends of the rod. The rod is secured to the lid top surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by welding, riveting, or other equivalent means with the handle projecting perpendicularly upward from the lid top surface and the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> projecting downwardly from opposite sides of the lid adjacent ends of the notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the lid rim <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is generally cylindrical in shape and is adapted to support food items placed thereon. However, it is to be understood that the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> could have other configurations such as rectangular, square, or any other shape without departing from the scope of the invention. In the preferred embodiment, the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a colander type construction with a perforated, circular horizontal bottom member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a perforated side wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that extends upwardly from the periphery of the horizontal member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Two vertical members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on diametrically opposite sides of the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extend upwardly from the periphery of the horizontal member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> beyond the perforated side wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to top ends <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that are formed as support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are complementary to and selectively connectable to the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be described. In the preferred embodiment, the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed as inverted U-shaped hooks that extend radially outwardly from opposite sides of the food support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has been described in a specific embodiment, it should be understood that any number of vertical members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may extend upwardly beyond the perforated side wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and each may have top ends <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with integral support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It should also be understood that the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may have a construction of a wire basket often used in deep frying foods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be suspended from the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are connected to the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is suspended from the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the user may insert or remove the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by the handle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this way, the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides a shield that prevents the hot liquid contents of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from spattering onto the user&apos;s hand and arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the preferred embodiment, the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are J-shaped hooks and the food support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are inverted U-shaped hooks that are complementary to the lid connectors. However, it is to be understood that the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be of any complementary shapes that are selectively connectable to each other without departing from the scope of the invention. It is also to be understood that while the preferred embodiment is shown with two support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and two lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, there can be any number of lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is generally cylindrical in shape and has a bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a side wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that extends upwardly from the bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to a top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the side wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The container bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and side wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> define an interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has handles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> attached to opposite sides of the container side wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The side wall top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage with the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to suspend the food support in the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is placed in the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> engage with the side wall top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, to suspend the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a spaced relation from the bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a spigot. A first embodiment of the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and a second spigot embodiment <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; of conventional construction is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a spout <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has first and second ends <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and an interior passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that extends through the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from the spigot first end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has internal screw threads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that extend along a portion of the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> between the spigot first and second ends <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to the container side wall <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the spigot first end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> near the container bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> communicates with the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The spout <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has an interior passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and opposite first and second ends <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The spout passageway at the first end <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> communicates with the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the spout passageway at the second end <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> opens out of the spout <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has internal screw threads <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and opposite first and second ends <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The valve member screw threads <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> mate with the spigot passageway screw threads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and preferably both are fine threads to prevent leakage past the mating threads. A knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is connected to the valve member second end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is threaded into the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with the valve member first end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> positioned in the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the valve member second end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> extending outwardly from the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The engagement of the valve member threads <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> with the spigot passageway threads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> allows the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to be selectively rotated in the passageway and moved in opposite directions between opened and closed positions of the valve member in the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> by turning the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. As set forth above, the valve member threads <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the spigot passageway threads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are preferably finely threaded, however, any thread dimensions that can effectuate a leak tight engagement and prevent the flow of liquid oil or water past the threads is sufficient. The selective rotation of the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> causes the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to move along the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> between the spigot first and second ends <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and between opened and closed positions of the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> relative to the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in the opened position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the valve member first end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is between the spout first end <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, thereby creating a flow path between the spout passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in the closed position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the valve member first end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is between the spout first end <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the spigot first end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, thereby closing the flow path and preventing communication between the spout passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, a valve member stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is connected to the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends outwardly from the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> around the valve member second end <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is dimensioned and adapted to limit the movement of the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> along the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to prevent the valve member first end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from being removed from the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. While the stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is shown as being &ldquo;U&rdquo; shaped and looping around the valve member knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that any configuration of the stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that prevents the valve member first end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from being removed from the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In operation, the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows for the liquid contents of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be selectively drained from the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in the opened position, the spout passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> communicates with the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the liquid contents of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to flow through the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the spout passageway <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. To close the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, when the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in the opened position, the user rotates the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with their thumb and forefinger in a clockwise direction, when looking along the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> toward the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to move along the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> toward the spigot first end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. When the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is sufficiently rotated, the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in its closed position and prevents communication between the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the spout passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. When opening the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the closed position, the user rotates the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in a counter-clockwise direction, when looking along the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> toward the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to move along the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> toward the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. When the knob <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> contacts the stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in the fully opened position and the spout passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> communicates with the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> prevents the continuing movement of the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> toward the spigot second end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the unintentional removal of the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the spigot passageway <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment of the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is of conventional construction and will not be described in detail. Component parts of the second spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&prime; that correspond to parts of the first spigot embodiment are identified by the same reference numbers followed by a prime (&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As set forth earlier, in the preferred embodiment, the cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made out of metal, such as aluminum, carbon steel, or stainless steel and may contain a non-stick coating. However, it should be understood that any material of construction may be used that is safe for cooking food and capable of being heated to the high temperatures necessary for deep frying food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the cooking apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with a food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that has support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that are dimensioned and adapted to engage with the container side wall top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and are selectively connectable with the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In use, the user would fill the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the desired cooking medium, such as water or oil, and then heat the contents of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the desired temperature by a heat source such as a gas burner. The user would then place the food items to be cooked in the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Next the user would take the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and connect the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, lift the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into a position above the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and then lower the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides a shield against spattering hot oil or water coming into contact with the user as the food support is lowered. As the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is being lowered into the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> engage with the side wall top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and suspend the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a spaced relation from the container bottom surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The user may then leave the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, if desired, or remove the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To remove the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, without removing the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the user would, after ensuring the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are fully engaged with and being suspended by the side wall top edge <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, rotate the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a counter-clockwise direction, when viewed from above, to disconnect the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The lengths of the lid rim notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the positions of the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the ends of the notches provide sufficient clearance for the food support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when rotating the lid relative to the food support connectors. The user can then remove the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> without removing the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When it is desired to remove the food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the user would place the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on top of the container <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the food support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> positioned in the notches <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> opposite the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The user then rotates the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> clockwise, when viewed from above, to connect the lid connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the support connectors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The user may then safely lift the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the attached food support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the lid <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> again providing a shield against hot oil or water coming in contact with the user. The user may then empty the contents of the container interior <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by opening the valve member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the spigot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as was discussed above. </paragraph>
