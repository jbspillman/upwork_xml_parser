<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit device. More particularly, the invention relates to technology that can be effectively adapted to a semiconductor integrated circuit device containing two kinds of MISFETs (metal insulator semiconductor field-effect transistors) to which different voltages are applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a memory LSI such as CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) logic LSI (large scale integrated circuit) and SRAM (static random access memory) or DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and in a CMOS logic LSI mounting a memory circuit, the power source voltages may not often be the same between the internal circuit and the input/output circuit. In the CMOS logic LSI, for example, the length (gate length) of the gate electrodes of MISFETs in the internal circuit is set to be shorter than the gate length of MISFETs in the input/output circuit in order to increase the speed. In order to maintain a breakdown voltage of the semiconductor regions constituting the sources and drains of MISFETs in the internal circuit, however, the power-source voltage for the internal circuit is set to be lower than the power-source voltage for the input/output circuit. Here, in order to maintain reliability of the gate-insulating films of MISFETs in the input/output circuit having the high power-source voltage, the thickness of the gate-insulating films is selected to be larger than the thickness of the gate-insulating films of MISFETs in the internal circuit having the low power-source voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Two kinds of gate-insulating films having different thicknesses are formed on a semiconductor substrate of silicon by, first, forming element isolation regions on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate and, then, subjecting the semiconductor substrate to the heat oxidation treatment of the first time to form a silicon oxide film on the surface of the semiconductor substrate. Next, active regions where the thick gate-insulating film will be formed are covered with a photoresist film, the silicon oxide film on the active regions on where the thin gate-insulating film will be formed is removed by wet etching and, then, the photoresist film is removed, followed heat-oxidizing the semiconductor substrate in the second time. That is, the thin gate-insulating film is formed through the heat oxidation of the second time, and the thick gate-insulating film is formed through the heat oxidation of the first time and through the heat oxidation of the second time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Through their study, however, the present inventors have discovered the fact that according to the above-mentioned method of forming two kinds of gate-insulating films of different thicknesses, the active regions on where the thick gate-insulating film is to be formed is covered with the photoresist film at the time of removing, by wet etching, the silicon oxide film from the active regions on where the thin gate-insulating film is to be formed. Therefore, the thin gate-insulating film, thick gate-insulating film or these two gate-insulating films lose breakdown voltage due to contamination caused by the photoresist film and due to any damage in the step of removing the photoresist film and in the subsequent step of washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide technology capable of improving reliability of the semiconductor integrated circuit device containing a plurality of kinds of MISFETs having gate-insulating films of different thicknesses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> That is, the invention is concerned with a process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films, wherein a first insulating film is formed by etching, using a photoresist film as a mask, on a region of a semiconductor substrate on where an insulating film of a first relatively large thickness is to be formed and, then, a second insulating film is formed on the first insulating film in order to prevent the first insulating film from being scraped off in the step of washing which precedes the processing for forming an insulating film of a second relatively small thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, the invention is concerned with a process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films, wherein a first insulating film is formed by etching, using a photoresist film as a mask, on a region of a semiconductor substrate on where an insulating film of a first relatively large thickness is to be formed and, then, a second insulating film that has been formed in advance on the first insulating film is used as an etching stopper in the step of washing which precedes the processing for forming an insulating film of a second relatively small thickness. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> (a) depositing an electrically conducting film for forming the gate electrode on the semiconductor substrate after the insulating film of said first thickness and the insulating film of said second thickness have been formed; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> (e) depositing an electrically conducting film for forming silicide on said semiconductor substrate in a state where the upper surfaces of said gate electrodes and part or whole of the pair of semiconductor regions are exposed; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> (f) heat-treating said semiconductor substrate to form a silicide layer in a contact portion between the electrically conducting film for forming said silicide and the gate electrodes or the pair of semiconductor regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In forming a plurality of kinds of gate insulating films having different thicknesses according to the above-mentioned means, the photoresist pattern is not directly formed on the first insulating film that constitutes a relatively thick gate-insulating film but, instead, the photoresist pattern is formed via the second insulating film or via a reformed layer of the first insulating film. Therefore, contaminants from the photoresist film adhere on the second insulating film or on the reformed layer of the first insulating film. As the first insulating film, there is used a film formed by heat-treating the semiconductor substrate, a film formed by the chemical vapor-phase deposition method, or a film formed by nitriding the film that has been formed by the chemical vapor-phase deposition method. As the second insulating film, there is used a film formed by, for example, the chemical vapor-phase deposition method which is different from the method of forming the first insulating film. This enables the second insulating film in the washing solution to be etched at a rate larger than the rate of etching the first insulating film. By selectively removing the second insulating film by utilizing the difference in the etching rate, therefore, the first insulating film is not affected by the contamination caused the resist and, besides, damage to the first insulating film can be avoided in the step of removing the resist and in the subsequent washing step. By removing the surface portion of the first insulating film within such a degree that no defect develops in the film, further, it is allowed to remove contaminants adhered on the interface between the first insulating film and the second insulating film, contributing to further improving reliability of the gate-insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> According to the above means, further, in effecting the washing prior to forming the insulating film of the relatively small second thickness, the second insulating film prevents the first insulating film from being scraped off on the region on where the insulating film of the relatively large first thickness is formed, so that weak spots in the first insulating film will not be exposed and that fine pores will not be formed. Therefore, the gate-insulating film having the relatively large first thickness is suppressed or prevented from losing breakdown voltage, and the quality of the gate-insulating film can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> According to the above means, further, in effecting the washing prior to forming the insulating film of the relatively small second thickness, the second insulating film formed in advance on the first insulating film on the region on where the insulating film of the relatively large first thickness has been formed, works as an etching stopper so that the first insulating film is not scraped off, weak spots in the first insulating film will not be exposed and that fine pores will not be formed. Therefore, the gate-insulating film having the relatively large first thickness is prevented from losing the breakdown voltage that stems when the first insulating film is scraped off during the washing, and improved quality of the gate-insulating film can be maintained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Prior to describing the embodiment 1, mentioned below are a process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films and the assignment therefor discussed by the present inventors for accomplishing the invention. In the drawings, the left side is a region (thin-film portion) IR forming an MISFET having a thin gate-insulating film and the right side is a region (thick-film portion) CR forming a MISFET having an thick gate-insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a partial sectional view of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a step of manufacture. First, a groove is formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an insulating film of silicon oxide or the like is buried in the groove, and a groove-type isolation portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Then, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is heat-oxidized to form a first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the main surface (active region) of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a photoresist film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is formed in a manner of directly contacted onto the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to cover the thick-film portion CK but permitting the thin-film portion to be exposed, and the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is removed from the thin-film portion IR using the photoresist film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as an etching mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Then, the photoresist film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing to obtain a sectional structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Then, the washing is effected. The washing includes, for example, a first washing treatment (SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and a second washing treatment (SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The first washing treatment (SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is chiefly for removing foreign matter and, for example, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as a washing solution. The second washing treatment (SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is chiefly for removing metals and, for example, HCl/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as a washing solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the whole semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inclusive of the main surface is pre-washed. The pre-washing is an important treatment for reducing or eliminating damage at the time of removing the spontaneously oxidized film or the photoresist film formed on the main surface of, for example, the thin-film portion on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and for reducing or eliminating contamination in the first silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK caused by the photoresist film. According to the study by the present inventors, it was discovered that when it is presumed that the silicon oxide film exists on the thin-film portion IR, the pre-washing is necessary for removing the silicon oxide film by a thickness of, for example, not less than 1 nm and, desirably, by about 2 nm from the standpoint of improving reliability. According to technology discussed by the present inventors, the first washing and the third washing (DHF) are effected in the pre-washing treatment. The third washing (DHF) is for chiefly removing the spontaneously oxidized film and, for example, hydrofluoric acid is used as the washing solution. When the pre-washing is effected, the upper portion of the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the thick-film portion CK is scraped off as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Symbol &Dgr;dox represents the amount of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> scraped off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> After the pre-washing, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is subjected to a second heat-oxidation treatment thereby to form a second silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> on the thin-film portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) and to form the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the thick-film portion CK maintaining a thickness larger than that of the second silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> on the thin-film portion IR. Thereafter, gate electrodea are formed on the first and second silicon oxide films in the same manner as that of forming an ordinary field-effect transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the above process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films, the present inventors have discovered the following assignment based on the experimental results. That is, in conducting the pre-washing, the upper part of the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is scraped off, weak spots considered to be existing in the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are exposed and are further expanded to form very fine pores. When the gate electrode is formed on the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that has been completed, the fine pores are further expanded due to stress produced by the gate electrode. Then, the quality of the first silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that requires a high breakdown voltage is deteriorated, and the breakdown voltage is no longer maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In this invention, therefore, another insulating film is interposed between the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK that requires the large breakdown voltage and the photoresist film for patterning the silicon oxide film in the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films. This makes it possible to greatly decrease the scraping amount of the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK during the pre-washing. Accordingly, weak spots considered to be existing in the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK are suppressed or preventing from being exposed. Further, since the photoresist film does not come into direct contact with the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK, the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK is little contaminated or is not contaminated by the photoresist film. Moreover, another insulating film is formed on the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion CK under the photoresist film. At the time of removing the photoresist film, therefore, the underlying film (silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion) is little damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The technical idea of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) which are sectional views illustrating a major portion of a semiconductor substrate at the same position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Referring, first, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a shallow groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is engraved in a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the like film is buried in the shallow groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to form, for example, a groove-type element isolation region (trench isolation) on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is heat-oxidized to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the main surface (active region) of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed as a protection film in a manner of being directly contacted to the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by, for example, the CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method. Then, a photoresist pattern (masking film, masking pattern) is formed thereon being directly contacted thereto so as to cover the thick-film portion CK but permitting the thin-film portion to be exposed. By using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, further, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the protection film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are removed from the thin film portion IR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Then, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing to obtain a sectional structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). At this moment, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is a protection film has been formed on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> under the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is little damaged. The washing treatment is effected. In washing the back surface, the first washing (SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the second washing (SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are effected. The first washing and the second washing are the same as those employed for the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films discussed by the present inventors, and are not described here again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Next, the whole semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inclusive of the main surface is subjected to the pre-washing (first washing and third washing (DHF)) like in the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films discussed by the present inventors. This makes it possible to reduce or eliminate damage at the time of removing the spontaneously oxidized film or removing the photoresist film formed on the main surface of, for example, the thin-film portion IR of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. According to the technical idea of the invention, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the thick-film portion CK does not come in direct contact with the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is little contaminated or is not contaminated by the photoresist film. In conducting the pre-washing, therefore, much consideration needs not be given to the contamination of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the photoresist film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Upon effecting the pre-washing, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be chiefly removed by etching, since the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is the protection film formed the CVD method is etched at a rate larger than a rate at which the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed by the heat-oxidation is etched. In this pre-washing, too, the upper part of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the thick-film portion CK is scraped off by about &Dgr;dox as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). In this case, however, the scraping amount can be suppressed to be very small so that the weak spots will not be exposed. It is, therefore, made possible to maintain the breakdown voltage of the gate-insulating film on the thick-film portion that requires the large breakdown voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> After the pre-washing, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to the second heat-oxidation treatment to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a relatively large thickness on the thick-film portion CK and to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having a relatively small thickness on the thin-film portion IR as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). The silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are used as gate-insulating films of the field-effect transistor. Then, the gate electrode is formed on the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the same manner as that of forming an ordinary field-effect transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show the measured results of breakdown voltage of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of when there is employed the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films of the technical idea of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For the purpose of comparison, further, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) show the measured results of breakdown voltage of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of when there is employed the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films discussed by the present inventors shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show the results of when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is scraped off by &Dgr;dox&equals;1 nm, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) show the results of when &Dgr;dox&equals;2 nm. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it can be said that the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>exhibits better breakdown voltage when the scraping amount &Dgr;dox of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is small. For the purpose of comparison, further, FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show the measured results of breakdown voltage of the silicon oxide film formed by the process for forming one kind of gate-insulating film. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the abscissas represent the breaking electric field intensity of the silicon oxide film formed on the thick-film portion, and the ordinates represent the count of defects. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), further, the abscissas represent the electric field intensity of the silicon oxide film formed on the thick-film portion and the ordinates represent the gate current flowing between the gate electrode and the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Here, the polycrystalline silicon film and the tungsten silicide film are successively formed on the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a capacitor is so formed by using an exclusive photomask that the areas S of the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are 1 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>each. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a thickness &Dgr;dox of, for example, about 8.9 nm and its scraping amount &Dgr;dox is, for example, about 1 nm. Further, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a thickness dox of, for example, from about 8.2 to 8.3 nm and its scraping amount &Dgr;dox is, for example, from about 1 to 2 nm. The silicon oxide film formed by the process for forming one kind of gate-insulating film has a thickness dox of, for example, about 8.5 nm. As will be understood from FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, by using the technical idea of the invention, the breakdown voltage of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be increased to be nearly equal to that of the silicon oxide film formed by the process for forming one kind of gate-insulating film. That is, when the technical idea of the invention is employed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the scraping amount &Dgr;dox of the thick-film portion can be decreased (to about 0.2 nm) as compared with the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>. According to the technical idea of the invention, therefore, it is allowed to suppress or prevent weak spots in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from being exposed during the pre-washing, and the weak spots are further suppressed or prevented from expanding into fine pores. Thus, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the thick-film portion maintains improved quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the experimental results obtained by the inventors, i.e., showing a relationship between the etching amount (equivalent to washing time) in the direction of thickness of the silicon oxide film on the thin-film portion after the pre-washing (first washing SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the thickness of the silicon oxide film left on the semiconductor substrate. When it is presumed that a silicon oxide film exists on the thin-film portion, it will be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that the above pre-washing must be effected to such a degree as to remove the silicon oxide film by, for example, not less than 1 nm and, preferably, about 2 nm to improve reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate the measured results of a relationship (I-V characteristics) between the gate current and the gate voltage of when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is not left on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (technical idea of the invention) and when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is left on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a relationship between the defect density and the scraping amount of the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion due to etching during the pre-washing. Black circles represent points of measuring the defect density of the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion formed by the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films according to the technical idea of the invention, and an open circle represents a point of measuring the defect density of the silicon oxide film formed by the process for forming one kind of gate-insulating film.

According to the study by the inventors, it is desired that the scraping amount is not larger than 1 nm and, preferably, from about 0.2 to about 0.5 nm. That is, according to the invention, the scraping amount of the silicon oxide film on the thick-film portion can be decreased to be not larger than 1 nm and, hence, to improve reliability of the gate-insulating film on the thick-film portion. </paragraph>

Similarly, the scraping amount is 0.4 nm when the thickness of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is 7.5 nm thick, the scraping amount is 0.2 nm when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is 10 nm thick, and the scraping amount is 0 nm when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is 15 nm thick. </paragraph>

On the other hand, the region B of the thin-film portion on which field-effect transistors are formed having a relatively thin gate-insulting film occupies the peripheral circuit area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> only. In terms of the area, the region A of the thick-film portion is about 30 times wider than the region B of the thin-film portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment as described above, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not formed directly on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> but is formed thereon via the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is the protection film formed by the CVD method at the time of forming two kinds of gate-insulating films of different thicknesses. Therefore, contaminants from the photoresist film adheres on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that is formed by the CVD method. Thereafter, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is selectively removed preventing the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from being contaminated by the photoresist film, avoiding the effect of fixed electric charge in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and further avoiding damage in the step of removing the resist and in the subsequent step of washing. By introducing nitrogen into the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, further, the resistance can be increased against the hot carrier effect. </paragraph>

Here, since the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has been formed on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> under the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is damaged little. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Next, the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is washed. The washing of back surface includes, for example, a first washing and a second washing as described in the embodiment 1 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Then, the whole semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inclusive of the main surface is subjected to the pre-washing in the same manner as in the process for forming two kinds of gate-insulating films studied by the present inventors as described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is a sectional view illustrating a major portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after the pre-washing, wherein &Dgr;dt represents the amount by which the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is scraped. This eliminates the spontaneously oxidized film formed on the main surface of, for example, the thin-film portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to decrease or eliminate damage at the time of removing the photoresist film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> According to the technical idea of the invention, the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not almost etched through the pre-washing (e.g., washing with hydrofluoric acid). This prevents weak spots in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from being exposed during the pre-washing, making it possible to secure the breakdown voltage of the gate-insulating film on the thick-film portion where a high breakdown voltage is required. The insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> works as a stopper during the pre-washing and, hence, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> remains. This contributes to improving precision for setting the thickness of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> According to the technical idea of the invention, too, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the thick-film portion is covered with the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is the protection film and does not come into direct contact with the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> like in the above embodiment 1, making it possible to decrease or prevent the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from being contaminated by the photoresist film. Like in the above embodiment 1, therefore, much attention needs not be given to the contamination of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the photoresist film during the pre-washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> After the pre-washing, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to the second heat oxidation to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that constitutes a relatively thin gate-insulating film on the thin-film portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Here, no film is formed since the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having anti-oxidizing property has been formed on the thick-film portion. Therefore, the relatively thick gate-insulating film on the thick-film portion is constituted by the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and by the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed thereon. Thereafter, a gate electrode is formed on the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the same manner as that of forming an ordinary field-effect transistor. Thus, the technical idea of the invention described above offers the same effect as that of the invention described in the above embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Next, described below is the case where the technical idea of the invention is applied to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit device having, for example, a CMIS (complementary metal insulator semiconductor) circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> First, after the steps same as the steps of manufacturing the semiconductor integrated circuit device explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, an insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed as a protection film on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. The insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is composed of a material having anti-oxidizing property and resistance against the washing, and is, for example, a silicon nitride film. The insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a thickness smaller than that of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, i.e., has a thickness of, for example, from about 0.5 to about 1.0 &mgr;m that is not removed through the pre-washing that will be described later. The insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed by, for example, depositing an insulating film of silicon nitride on the silicon oxide film by the CVD method or JVD method, or by reforming the surface of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the PRN treatment such as plasma-nitriding or radical-nitriding, or by the heat-nitriding. In the case of the reforming (particularly, when the PRN treatment is employed), a very thin insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be formed maintaining a high precision. Further, the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed in a state where nitrogen and the silicon oxide film are bonded together, featuring highly bonded state and large resistance against the etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> same as that of the embodiment 1 is formed on the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is used as an etching mask to successively etch the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from the region B which is the thin-film portion. Thereafter, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is removed followed by the same pre-washing as that of the embodiment 1 to obtain a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>. The insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not almost etched through the pre-washing. Therefore, the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are left on the region A which is the thick-film portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Next, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is heat-oxidized to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the main surface of the region B which is the thin-film portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>. No film is formed on the region A which is the thick-film portion since the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a strong anti-oxidizing property has been formed thereon, and a laminate of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed thereon. Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>, gate electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and on the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the embodiment 1. The subsequent steps are the same as those of the embodiment 1 and are not described. In this embodiment 9, too, the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of silicon nitride is formed on the gate-insulating film on the region A which is the thick-film portion, exhibiting the following effects like those obtained in the above embodiment 4. This makes it easy to form the gate-insulating film on the thick-film portion. It is further allowed to suppress or prevent the flow of a gate current (tunnel current) between the gate electrode and the semiconductor substrate in the thick-film portion of the MISFET. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 10 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The embodiment 10 is a modification from the embodiment 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> First, after the steps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, an insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> having a high dielectric constant is formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference>. Thus, a gate-insulating film which is an insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed on the region B which is the thin-film portion, and a gate-insulating film which is a laminate of the insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is formed on the region A which is the thick-film portion. The insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is, for example, the one of silicon nitride formed by the CVD method, RPN method or JVD method like the insulating film <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or is the one of tantalum oxide (Ta<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>: e.g., Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), titanium oxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>: e.g., TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or SiON. The insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> hay have a thickness required for the gate-insulating film on the region B which is the thin-film portion. In this embodiment 10, the insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a high dielectric constant. Therefore, despite the thickness is not so small, the MISFET exhibits performance comparable to that of when the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>) has a small thickness. It is therefore allowed to form the gate-insulating films maintaining relatively large thicknesses on the region A which is the thick-film portion and on the region B which is the thin-film portion, enabling the film thicknesses to be easily controlled like in the embodiment 4. It is further allowed to suppress or prevent the leakage current between the gate electrode and the semiconductor substrate. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>, gate electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed on the insulating film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on the region A which is the thick-film portion and on the region B which is the thin-film portion like in the embodiment 1. The subsequent steps are the same as those of the embodiment 1 and are not described. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 11 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The embodiment 11 deals with a modification of the gate electrodes of the MISFET, i.e., deals with a method of forming a so-called dual gate-polymetal gate electrode structure, and can be applied to any one of the embodiments 1 to 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> First, after the steps same as those of the embodiment 1 shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is deposited by the CVD method on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is so formed on the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as to expose the region where the n-channel MISFET is to be formed but to cover other regions. By using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> as a mask, impurities such as P (phosphorus) ions are injected into a portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is not covered by the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Thus, the portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the p-type well <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> assumes the n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-type. Then, after the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is removed, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> permitting the p-channel MISFET-forming region to be exposed but covering other regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>. Then, by using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a mask, impurities such as B (boron) ions are injected into a portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is not covered by the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the portion of the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the n-type well assumes the p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>, an electrically conducting film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> such as of tungsten nitride or titanium nitride is deposited by sputtering on the polycrstalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and, then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>, an electrically conducting film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of ,tungsten or the like is deposited thereon by sputtering. Further, an insulating film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for a cap comprising, for example, a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film is deposited thereon by the CVD method. The electrically conducting film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> suppresses the formation of a silicide layer that results from the reaction of tungsten in the electrically conducting film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with silicon in the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Then, the polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the electrically conducting films <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the insulating film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for cap are patterned by the photolithography technology and dry-etching technology, in order to form the gate electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the insulating film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for cap thereon in the same manner as in the embodiment 1. The subsequent steps are the same as those of the embodiment 1 and are not described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> This embodiment 11, too, exhibits the same effect as that of the embodiments 1 to 10. In particular, the following effect is obtained when the gate electrode structure of this embodiment 11 is applied to the above embodiments 5, 9 and 10. That is, in the embodiment 5, the nitride film (nitride layer) is formed on the gate-insulating films of MISFETs in the thick-film portion and in the thin-film portion. In the embodiments 9 and 10, further, the gate-insulating film of the MISFET on the thick-film portion is constituted by a laminate of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on which are deposited insulating films <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of silicon nitride (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 52</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the nitride layers or the insulating films <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> suppress or prevent boron ions having a high diffusion coefficient in the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from being diffused to the side of the silicon oxide film. This makes it possible to improve operation reliability and yield of the p-channel MISFETs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing was concretely described the invention accomplished by the present inventors by way of embodiments. It should, however, be noted that the invention is in no way limited to the above-mentioned embodiments only but can be modified in a variety of other ways without departing from the gist and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The above embodiments 1 to 11 have dealt with the case where the invention was adapted to the semiconductor integrated circuit device having, for example, a CMIS circuit and to the DRAM. Not being limited thereto only, however, the invention can be adapted to a semiconductor device having a memory circuit, such as SRAM (static random access memory) or flush memory (EEPROM: electric erasable programmable read-only memory), to a semiconductor device having a logic circuit, such as microprocessor, and to a hybrid semiconductor device having the memory circuit and the logic circuit formed in the same semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Briefly described below are effects obtained by representative examples of the invention disclosed in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a plurality of kinds of gate-insulating films having dissimilar thicknesses are formed without causing contamination from the resist film, avoiding damage in the step of removing the resist and in the subsequent step of washing and, hence, without deteriorating the breakdown voltage of the gate-insulating films. Further, the interface level is lowered to stabilize the operation characteristics of the MISFET, contributing to improving reliability of the MISFET having a plurality of kinds of gate-insulating films of dissimilar thicknesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, further, the thicknesses of the gate-insulating films are favorably controlled, and the production yields of MISFETs can be enhanced. </paragraph>
