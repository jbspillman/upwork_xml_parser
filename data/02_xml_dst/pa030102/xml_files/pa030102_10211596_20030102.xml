<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to fused abrasive particles and methods of making the same. The fused abrasive particles can be incorporated into a variety of abrasive articles, including bonded abrasives, coated abrasives, nonwoven abrasives, and abrasive brushes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of abrasive particles (e.g., diamond particles, cubic boron nitride particles, fused abrasive particles, and sintered, ceramic abrasive particles (including sol-gel-derived abrasive particles) known in the art. In some abrading applications, the abrasive particles are used in loose form, while in others the particles are incorporated into abrasive products (e.g., coated abrasive products, bonded abrasive products, non-woven abrasive products, and abrasive brushes). Criteria used in selecting abrasive particles used for a particular abrading application include: abrading life, rate of cut, substrate surface finish, grinding efficiency, and product cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> From about 1900 to about the mid-1980&apos;s, the premier abrasive particles for abrading applications such as those utilizing coated and bonded abrasive products were typically fused abrasive particles. There are two general types of fused abrasive particles: (1) fused alpha alumina abrasive particles (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,161,620 (Coulter), 1,192,709 (Tone), 1,247,337 (Saunders et al.), 1,268,533 (Allen), and 2,424,645 (Baumann et al.)) and (2) fused (sometimes also referred to as &ldquo;co-fused&rdquo;) alumina-zirconia abrasive particles (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,891,408 (Rowse et al.), 3,781,172 (Pett et al.), 3,893,826 (Quinan et al.), 4,126,429 (Watson), 4,457,767 (Poon et al.), and 5,143,522 (Gibson et al.))(also see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,212 (Dubots et. al) and 5,336,280 (Dubots et. al) which report the certain fused oxynitride abrasive particles). Fused alumina abrasive particles are typically made by charging a furnace with an alumina source such as aluminum ore or bauxite, as well as other desired additives, heating the material above its melting point, cooling the melt to provide a solidified mass, crushing the solidified mass into particles, and then screening and grading the particles to provide the desired abrasive particle size distribution. Fused alumina-zirconia abrasive particles are typically made in a similar manner, except the furnace is charged with both an alumina source and a zirconia source, and the melt is more rapidly cooled than the melt used to make fused alumina abrasive particles. For fused alumina-zirconia abrasive particles, the amount of alumina source is typically about 50-80 percent by weight, and the amount of zirconia, 50-20 percent by weight zirconia. The processes for making the fused alumina and fused alumina abrasive particles may include removal of impurities from the melt prior to the cooling step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although fused alpha alumina abrasive particles and fused alumina-zirconia abrasive particles are still widely used in abrading applications (including those utilizing coated and bonded abrasive products, the premier abrasive particles for many abrading applications since about the mid-1980&apos;s are sol-gel-derived alpha alumina particles (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,314,827 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,518,397 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,623,364 (Cottringer et al.), 4,744,802 (Schwabel), 4,770,671 (Monroe et al.), 4,881,951 (Wood et al.), 4,960,441 (Pellow et al.), 5,139,978 (Wood), 5,201,916 (Berg et al.), 5,366,523 (Rowenhorst et al.), 5,429,647 (Larmie), 5,547,479 (Conwell et al.), 5,498,269 (Larmie), 5,551,963 (Larmie), and 5,725,162 (Garg et al.)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The sol-gel-derived alpha alumina abrasive particles may have a microstructure made up of very fine alpha alumina crystallites, with or without the presence of secondary phases added. The grinding performance of the sol-gel derived abrasive particles on metal, as measured, for example, by life of abrasive products made with the abrasive particles was dramatically longer than such products made from conventional fused alumina abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typically, the processes for making sol-gel-derived abrasive particles are more complicated and expensive than the processes for making conventional fused abrasive particles. In general, sol-gel-derived abrasive particles are typically made by preparing a dispersion or sol comprising water, alumina monohydrate (boehmite), and optionally peptizing agent (e.g., an acid such as nitric acid), gelling the dispersion, drying the gelled dispersion, crushing the dried dispersion into particles, screening the particles to provide the desired sized particles, calcining the particles to remove volatiles, sintering the calcined particles at a temperature below the melting point of alumina, and screening and grading the particles to provide the desired abrasive particle size distribution. Frequently a metal oxide modifier(s) is incorporated into the sintered abrasive particles to alter or otherwise modify the physical properties and/or microstructure of the sintered abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of abrasive products (also referred to &ldquo;abrasive articles&rdquo;) known in the art. Typically, abrasive products include binder and abrasive particles secured within the abrasive product by the binder. Examples of abrasive products include: coated abrasive products, bonded abrasive products, nonwoven abrasive products, and abrasive brushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Examples of bonded abrasive products include: grinding wheels, cutoff wheels, and honing stones). The main types of bonding systems used to make bonded abrasive products are: resinoid, vitrified, and metal. Resinoid bonded abrasives utilize an organic binder system (e.g., phenolic binder systems) to bond the abrasive particles together to form the shaped mass (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,741,743 (Narayanan et al.), 4,800,685 (Haynes et al.), 5,038,453 (Narayanan et al.), and 5,110,332 (Narayanan et al.)). Another major type are vitrified wheels in which a glass binder system is used to bond the abrasive particles together mass (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,107 (Rue), 4,898,587 (Hay et al.), 4,997,461 (Markhoff-Matheny et al.), and 5,863,308 (Qi et al.)). These glass bonds are usually matured at temperatures between 900&deg; C. to 1300&deg; C. Today vitrified wheels utilize both fused alumina and sol-gel-derived abrasive particles. However, fused alumina-zirconia is generally not incorporated into vitrified wheels due in part to the thermal stability of alumina-zirconia. At the elevated temperatures at which the glass bonds are matured, the physical properties of alumina-zirconia degrade, leading to a significant decrease in their abrading performance. Metal bonded abrasive products typically utilize sintered or plated metal to bond the abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The abrasive industry continues to desire abrasive particles and abrasive products that are easier to make, cheaper to make, and/or provide performance advantage(s) over conventional abrasive particles and products. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Fused Abrasive particles according to the present invention can be made by heating the appropriate metal oxides sources to form a melt, preferably a homogenous melt, and then rapidly cooling the melt to provide a solidified mass. The solidified mass is typically crushed to produce the desired particle size distribution of abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> More specifically, fused abrasive particles according to the present invention can be made by charging a furnace with sources of the appropriate raw materials (e.g., depending on the composition of the fused abrasive particles, materials such as metal oxide(s), metal carbides, metal nitrides, metal oxycaribides, and/or metal oxynitrides), and other optional additives (e.g., other metal carbides, nitrides, oxides, metal borides, and processing aids). The raw materials can be added to the furnace, for example, together and melted, or sequentially and melted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For solidified melt material containing complex metal oxide(s), at least a portion of the metal oxide present in the melted metal oxide sources (i.e., the melt) react to form complex metal oxide(s) during formation process of the solidified material.

In another aspect, however, it is believed that slow, unidirectional solidification of the melt also tends to minimize the number of colonies formed, while multidirectional solidification with relatively higher cooling rates tends to increase the number of colonies formed. The solidification rate (i.e., cooling rate) of the melt and/or multidirectional solidification of the melt tend to affect the type and/or number of microstructural imperfections (e.g., pores) present in the resulting fused abrasive particles. For example, although not wanting to be bound by theory, relatively rapid solidification (i.e., solidification with relatively high cooling rates) and/or multidirectional solidification tend to lead to an increase in the type and/or number of microstructural imperfections (e.g., pores) present in the resulting fused abrasive particles. Relatively slow solidification, however, tends to lead to an increase in the size of the colonies, and/or crystals present in the solidified material; although it may be possible through slow and controlled cooling, for example, to eliminate formation of colonies. Hence, in selecting the cooling rate and/or degree of multidirectional solidification, there may be a need to increase or decrease the cooling rate to obtain the optimal balance of desirable and undesirable microstructural characteristics associated with the various cooling rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Further, for a given composition, the size of the colonies and phases present within the colonies tends to decrease as the cooling rate of the melt increases. Typically, the eutectic colonies in abrasive particles according to the present invention are, on average, less than 100 micrometers, preferably, less than 50 micrometers, wherein such size for a given colony is the average of the two largest dimensions measured from a polished cross-section of the colony, as viewed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Typically, the smallest dimension of the crystalline phases making up the eutectic in a colony, as measured from a polished cross-section of the colony viewed with an SEM, is up to 10 micrometers; preferably, up to 5 micrometers; more preferably, up to 1 micrometer, or even up to 0.5 micrometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Some abrasive particles according to the present invention also include primary crystals of at least one of the metal oxide phases making up the eutectic constituent of the abrasive particle. For example, if the eutectic portion is made up of a LaAlO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>phase and a LaAl<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>18 </subscript></highlight>phase, the microstructure may also include primary crystals of LaAlO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which is believed to occur when the composition of the melt from which the abrasive particles are formed is rich in La<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., the melt contains, on a theoretical oxide basis, an excess of La<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>relative to the eutectic); or if the eutectic is made up of a Yb<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>phase, and Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the microstructure may also include primary crystals of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which is believed to occur when the composition of the melt from which the abrasive particles are formed is rich in Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(i.e., the melt contains, on a theoretical oxide basis, an excess of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>relative to the eutectic). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The formation of the primary crystals is believed to result from a deviation from the particular eutectic proportions. The greater the deviation, the larger the overall fraction of primary crystals. The primary crystals may be found in a variety of shapes, typically ranging from rod-like structures to dendritic-like structures. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the presence and/or formation of a primary crystal(s) adjacent to a colony may affect the resulting microstructure of the colony. In some cases it may be advantageous (e.g., for increased abrading performance) to have primary crystals (e.g., primary Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>crystals) present in the abrasive particles. It is also believed, however, that the abrading performance of an abrasive particle tends to decrease as the size of the primary crystals increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Further, although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that small additions (e.g., less than 5 percent by weight) of metal oxides other than those making up the eutectic may affect colony boundaries, and in turn affect properties (e.g., hardness and toughness) of the abrasive particle. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Commercially available sources of rare earth oxides for making abrasive particles according to the present invention include rare earth oxide powders, rare earth metals, rare earth-containing ores (e.g., bastnasite and monazite), rare earth salts, rare earth nitrates, and rare earth carbonates. The rare earth oxide(s) source may contain, or only provide, rare earth oxide(s).

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Commercially available sources of metal nitrides and metal carbides for making abrasive particles according to the present invention include powders and ores comprised of at least one of metal (e.g., aluminum) carbide or nitride and/or at least one other metal other than Al. Other materials containing carbon (e.g., graphite powder) and/or nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen gas) may also be used as a raw materials for making abrasive particles according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The addition of certain metal oxides may alter the crystalline structure or microstructure of the resulting fused abrasive particles. For example, although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is theorized that certain metal oxides or metal oxide containing compounds (even when used in relatively small amounts, for example, even 0.01 to 5 percent by weight, based on the total metal oxide content of the fused abrasive particle) may be present at the boundaries between the eutectic colonies. The presence of these metal oxides, which may be in the form of reaction products together or with the Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may affect the fracture characteristics and/or microstructure of the fused abrasive particles, and/or may affect the grinding characteristics of the abrasive particles. Certain metal oxides may also act as a processing aid, for example, to increase the density of the fused abrasive particles, by decreasing the size and/or number of pores in the fused abrasive particles. Certain metal oxides may also act as a processing aid, for example, to increase or decrease the effective melting temperature of the melt. Thus certain metal oxides may be added for processing reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Fused abrasive particles according to the present invention typically comprise less than 50 percent by weight (more typically, less than 20 percent by weight; in some cases in the range from 0.01 to5 percent by weight, in other cases from 0.1 to 1 percent by weight) of metals oxides (on a theoretical oxide basis) other than the eutectic forming metal oxides, based on the total metal oxide content of the respective abrasive particle. Sources of the metal oxides other than Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and rare earth oxides are also readily commercially available. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Materials for making abrasive particles according to the present invention also include fused abrasive particles (e.g., fused alumina abrasive particles) or other fused material (e.g., fused alumina material) having the same composition or different composition(s), which together with remaining metal oxide, carbide, and nitride sources, as the case may be, provide the desired composition of the fused abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A reducing agent, such as a carbon source may be added to reduce impurities during the melting process. Examples of carbon sources include: coal, graphite, petroleum coke, or the like. Typically, the amount of carbon included in the charge to the furnace is up 5% by weight of the charge; more typically, up to 3% by weight, and more typically, up to 2% by weight. Iron may also be added to the furnace charge to aid in the removal of impurities. The iron can combine with the impurities to make a material that can be removed magnetically, for example, from the melt or crushed solidified material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It is also within the scope of the present invention to include metal borides, carbides, nitrides, and combinations thereof in the fused, crystalline abrasive particles according to the present invention. Such materials may even be present within (e.g.; as inclusions) the eutectic material. Examples of metal borides, carbides, and nitrides may include titanium diboride, aluminum carbide, aluminum nitride, titanium carbide, titanium nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide, and boron nitride. Such materials are known in the art, and are commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The particular selection of metal oxide sources and other additives for making fused abrasive particles according to the present invention typically takes into account, for example, the desired composition and microstructure of the resulting abrasive particles, the desired physical properties (e.g., hardness or toughness) of the resulting abrasive particles, avoiding or minimizing the presence of undesirable impurities, the desired grinding characteristics of the resulting abrasive particles, and/or the particular process (including equipment and any purification of the raw materials before and/or during fusion and/or solidification) being used to prepare the abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The metal oxide sources and other additives can be in any form suitable to the process and equipment being used to make the abrasive particles. The raw materials can be fused using techniques and equipment known in the art for making conventional fused alumina and alumina-zirconia abrasive particles (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,781,172 (Pett et al.), 3,891,408 (Rowse et al.), 4,035,162 (Brothers et al.), 4,070,796 (Scott), 4,073,096 (Ueltz et al.), 4,126,429 (Watson), 4,457,767 (Poon et al.), 5,143,522 (Gibson et al.), and Re. 31,128 (Walker et al.), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Examples of furnaces for melting the metal oxide sources and other additives include arc furnaces, pig furnaces, arc tapping furnaces, electric furnaces, electric arc furnaces, and gas fired furnaces. Suitable electric furnaces include those in which the electrodes are arranged to create a &ldquo;kissing arc&rdquo;, wherein the lower tip of the electrodes are not in contact within the molten mass, as well as those in which the electrodes are submerged in the molten mass to provide resistance heating via current passing through the melt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The furnace may have a lining (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; or &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo;) that covers the inside of the furnace walls. The lining may be made from a material dissimilar to the fused abrasive particle composition. Typically, however it is preferred that the furnace lining is made from a composition or material similar, sometimes nearly identical or identical to the composition of the fused abrasive particle. Thus during processing, if the outer (exposed) surface of the lining melts, the potential contamination of the melt is reduced or minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> For some metal oxide sources and other additives, it may also be desirable to preheat feed prior to charging it into the furnace, or otherwise combining it with other metal oxide sources and other additives. For example, if carbonate, nitrate or other salts are used as the metal oxide source, it may be desirable to calcine (e.g., by heating them in air at about 400-1000&deg; C.) such materials prior to adding them with the other metal oxide source materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Generally, the metal oxide sources and other additives, if present, are heated to a molten state, and mixed until the melt is homogenous. Typically, the melt is heated to and held at a temperature at least 50&deg; C. (preferably, at least 100&deg; C.) above the melting point of the melt. If the temperature of the melt is too low, the viscosity of the melt may be undesirably too high, making it more difficult to homogenize the various metal oxide sources and other additives making up the melt, or to pour or otherwise transfer the melt from the furnace. If the temperature of the melt is too high temperature, and/or the melt heated for too long, energy will be wasted, and there may be undesirable volatilization of components of the melt as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In some cases, it may be desirable, to mix, or otherwise blend the metal oxide sources and other additives (e.g., volatile components (e.g., water or organic solvent) which may assist in forming a homogenous mixture or blend), if present, together prior to forming the melt. For example, particulate metal oxide sources can be milled (e.g., ball milled) to both mix the materials together, as well as reduce the size of the particulate material. Other techniques for mixing or blending the metal oxide sources and other additives, if present, together prior to forming the melt include high shear mixers, paddle mixers, V-blenders, tumblers, and the like. Milling times may range from several minutes to several hours, or even days. Optionally, fugitive materials such as water and organic solvents may be removed from the mixture or blend of metal oxide sources and other additives, for example, by heating, prior to forming the melt. For ease of handling, the metal oxide sources and other additives may also be agglomerated prior to charging them to the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The atmosphere over the melt may be at atmospheric pressure, a pressure above atmospheric pressure, or a pressure below atmospheric pressure, although a pressure below atmospheric pressure may be preferred in order to reduce the number of pores in the resulting solidified material. The atmosphere over the melt may also be controlled to provide an oxidizing, reducing or inert atmosphere which may affect the melt chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Reducing conditions during melting may aid in purifying the melt. In addition to, or alternatively to, adding a reducing agent to the melt, suitable reducing conditions may be obtained using carbon electrodes with an electric arc melting furnace. Under suitable reducing conditions, some impurities (e.g., silica, iron oxide, and titania) will convert to their respective molten metallic form, leading to a higher specific gravity for the melt. Such free metal(s) impurities would then tend to sink to the bottom of the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, it may be desired to oxidize free metal present in the melt before the melt is cooled (e.g., before pouring the melt from the furnace). For example, an oxygen lance(s) may be inserted into the melt just prior to pouring the melt from the furnace (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 960,712, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The melt can be cooled using any of a variety of techniques known in the art. Typically the furnace containing the melt is capable of being tilted such that the melt can be poured over or into a heat sink. Generally, the resulting solidified material is larger in size than the desired abrasive particles. Examples of heat sinks include metallic balls (e.g., cast iron or carbon steel balls), metallic rods, metallic plates, metallic rolls, and the like. In some instances, these heat sink materials may be internally cooled (e.g., water-cooled or a suitable refrigerant) to achieve fast cooling rates. The heat sink material may also be pieces of pre-fused abrasive particles (having the same or a different composition being solidified) or other refractory material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Further with regard to heat sinks, the melt can be cooled by pouring the melt over and in between a plurality of metallic balls. The balls typically range in diameter from about 1 to 50 cm, more typically 5 to 25 cm. The melt may also be cooled using book molds. Suitable book molds consist of a plurality of thin plates (e.g., metallic or graphite plates) that are spaced relatively close together. The plates are usually spaced less than 10 cm apart, typically less than 5 cm, and preferably less than 1 cm apart. The melt may also be poured into graphite or cast iron molds to form slabs. It is generally preferred that such &ldquo;slabs&rdquo; be relatively thin so as to achieve faster cooling rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The cooling rate is believed to affect the microstructure and physical properties of the solidified material, and thus the fused abrasive particles. Preferably, the melt is rapidly cooled as the size of the crystalline phases of the solidified material generally decreases as the cooling rate increase. Preferred cooling rates are at least 500&deg; C./min.; more preferably, at least 1000&deg; C./min; and even more preferably, at least 1500&deg; C./min. The cooling rate may depend upon several factors including the chemistry of the melt, the melting point of the melt, the type of heat sink, and the heat sink material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Rapid cooling may also be conducted under controlled atmospheres, such as a reducing, neutral or oxidizing environment to maintain and/or influence the desired crystalline phases, oxidation states, etc. during cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Additional details on cooling a melt can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re 31,128 (Walker et al.), 3,781,172 (Pett et al.), 4,070,796 (Scott et al.), 4,194,887 (Ueltz et al.), 4,415,510 (Richmond), 4,439,845 (Richmond), and 5,143,522 (Gibson et al.), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The resulting (solidified) fused material(s) is typically larger in size than that desired for the abrasive particle(s). The fused material can be, and typically is, converted into smaller pieces using crushing and/or comminuting techniques known in the art, including roll crushing, canary milling, jaw crushing, hammer milling, ball milling, jet milling, impact crushing, and the like. In some instances, it is desired to have two or multiple crushing steps. For example after the molten material is solidified, it may be in the form of a relatively large mass structure (e.g., a diameter greater than 5 cm. The first crushing step may involve crushing these relatively large masses or &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; to form smaller pieces. This crushing of these chunks may be accomplished with a hammer mill, impact crusher or jaw crusher. These smaller pieces may then be subsequently crushed to produce the desired particle size distribution. In order to produce the desired particle size distribution (sometimes referred to as grit size or grade), it may be necessary to perform multiple crushing steps. In general the crushing conditions are optimized to achieve the desired particle shape(s) and particle size distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The shape of fused abrasive particles according to the present invention depends, for example, on the composition and/or microstructure of the abrasive particles, the geometry in which it was cooled, and the manner in which the solidified material is crushed (i.e., the crushing technique used). In general, where a &ldquo;blocky&rdquo; shape is preferred, more energy may be employed to achieve this shape. Conversely, where a &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; shape is preferred, less energy may be employed to achieve this shape. The crushing technique may also be changed to achieve different desired shapes. Alternatively, abrasive particles may be directly formed into desired shapes by pouring or forming the melt into a mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The shape of the abrasive particles may be measured by various techniques known in the art, including bulk density and aspect ratio. The larger the abrasive particle size, the higher the bulk density due to the increased mass associated with larger particle sizes. Thus, when comparing bulk densities, the comparison should be made on abrasive particles having essentially the same particle size. In general, the larger the bulk density number, the &ldquo;blockier&rdquo; the abrasive particle is considered to be. Conversely the smaller the bulk density number, the &ldquo;sharper&rdquo; the abrasive particle is considered to be. Another way to measure sharpness is through an aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of a grade 36 for example, may range from about 1:1 to about 3:1, typically about 1.2:1 to about 2:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The bulk density of the abrasive particles can be measured in accordance with ANSI Standard B74.4-1992 (1992), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In general, the bulk density is measured by pouring the abrasive particles sample through a funnel so that the abrasive particles traverses through the funnel in a free flowing manner. Immediately underneath the funnel is a collection device (typically a graduated cylinder). A predetermined volume of abrasive particles arc collected and then weighed. The bulk density is calculated in terms of weight/volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Abrasive particles according to the present invention can be screened and graded using techniques well known in the art, including the use of industry recognized grading standards such as ANSI (American National Standard Institute), FEPA (Federation Europeenne des Fabricants de Products Abrasifs), and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard). Abrasive particles according to the present invention may be used in a wide range of particle sizes, typically ranging in size from about 0.1 to about 5000 micrometers, more typically from about 1 to about 2000 micrometers; preferably from about 5 to about 1500 micrometers, more preferably from about 100 to about 1500 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In a given particle size distribution, there will be a range of particle sizes, from coarse particles fine particles. In the abrasive art this range is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;coarse&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo; and &ldquo;fine&rdquo; fractions. Abrasive particles graded according to industry accepted grading standards specify the particle size distribution for each nominal grade within numerical limits. Such industry accepted grading standards include those known as the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standards, Federation of European Producers of Abrasive Products (FEPA) standards, and Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) standards. ANSI grade designations (i.e., specified nominal grades) include: ANSI 4, ANSI 6, ANSI 8, ANSI 16, ANSI 24, ANSI 36, ANSI 40, ANSI 50, ANSI 60, ANSI 80, ANSI 100, ANSI 120, ANSI 150, ANSI 180, ANSI 220, ANSI 240, ANSI 280, ANSI 320, ANSI 360, ANSI 400, and ANSI 600. Preferred ANSI grades comprising abrasive particles according to the present invention are ANSI 8-220.

Preferred JIS grades comprising abrasive particles according to the present invention are JIS8-220. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After crushing and screening, there will typically be a multitude of different abrasive particle size distributions or grades. These multitudes of grades may not match a manufacturer&apos;s or supplier&apos;s needs at that particular time. To minimize inventory, it is possible to recycle the off demand grades back into the molten mass. This recycling may occur after the crushing step, where the particles are in large chunks or smaller pieces (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;fines&rdquo;) that have not been screened to a particular distribution. A charge to the furnace for making fused abrasive particles according to the present invention may consist of anywhere from 0 to 100% by weight recycled fused abrasive particles, typically between 0 to 50% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Typically, the true density, sometimes referred to as specific gravity, of fused abrasive particles according to the present invention is typically at least 80% of theoretical density, although abrasive particles with a lower true density may also be useful in abrasive applications. Preferably, the true density of fused abrasive particles according to the present invention is at least 85% of theoretical density, more preferably at least 90% of theoretical density, and even more preferably at least 95% of theoretical density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Typically, fused abrasive particles according to the present invention may have an average toughness (i.e., resistance to fracture) of at least 2.0 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>; preferably at least 2.5 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>, more preferably at least 3.0 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>, and even more preferably, at least 3.3 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>, at least 3.5 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>, or even at least 3.8 MPa m<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It is also within the scope of the present invention to provide a surface coating on the fused abrasive particles. Surface coatings are known, for example, to improve the adhesion between the abrasive particles and the binder material in the abrasive article. Such surface coatings are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,910,444 (Nicholson), 3,041,156 (Rowse et al.), 4,997,461 (Markhoff-Matheny et al.), 5,009,675 (Kunz et al.), 5,042,991 (Kunz et al.), and 5,085,671 (Martin et al.), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Further, in some instances, the addition of the coating improves the abrading characteristics of the abrasive particles. Alternatively the surface coating may improve adhesion between the abrasive particle of the invention and the binder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Likewise after the abrasive particles are produced, it may be further heat-treated to improve its physical properties and/or grinding performance. This heat-treating process may occur in an oxidizing atmosphere. Typically this heat-treating process occurs at a temperature between about 1100&deg; C. to 1600&deg; C., usually between 1200&deg; C. to 1400&deg; C. The time may range from about 1 minute to days, usually between about 5 minutes to 1 hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Other suitable preparation techniques for making fused abrasive particles according to the present invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art after reviewing the disclosure herein, as well as, for example, applications having U.S. Ser. Nos. 09,495,978, 09/496,422, 09/496,638, and 09/496,713, each filed on Feb. 2, 2000, and, ______ (Attorney Docket Nos. 55333USA2B, 55763USA3A, 55353USA1B, 55765USA9A, 55764USA1A, 55605USA7A, 55606USA5A, 55607USA3A, 55608USA1A, and 55356USA4B, each filed on the same date as the instant application, the disclosure of which are all incorporated herein by reference </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention are thermally stable at elevated temperatures, as compared to conventional fused alumina-zirconia materials (including alumina-zirconia abrasive particles available from Norton Company, Worcester, Mass. under the trade designation &ldquo;NORZON&rdquo;). When alumina-zirconia eutectic abrasive particles available from Norton Company, Worcester, Mass. under the trade designation &ldquo;NORZON, are heated in air, for example, to at least about 350&deg; C., typically at least a portion of the zirconia undergoes a tetragonal and/or cubic to monoclinic phase transformation. This phase transformation is usually detrimental to the structural integrity of the alumina-zirconia material because it involves volume changes to the zirconia crystalline phases. Further, such phase transformations have been observed to occur preferentially at the boundaries of eutectic colonies, which thereby tend to weaken the boundaries, and which in turn tend to lead to significant degradation of mechanical properties (i.e., hardness, strength, etc.) of the material. In addition, various impurities, which are typically segregated during solidification of the melt into the eutectic colonies boundaries may also undergo volumetric structural changes (e.g., due to oxidation), leading to further degradation of mechanical properties (i.e., hardness, strength, etc.) of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> By contrast, preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention typically do not exhibit phase transformations of the eutectic phases when heated up to 1000&deg; C. (in some cases even up to 1400&deg; C.) in air, and thus are thermally stable. Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that this thermal stability allows such abrasive particle to be incorporated into vitrified bonded abrasives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The thermal stability of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention may be measured or illustrated using a variety of different techniques, including: Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction, hardness measurements, microstructure analysis, color change, and interaction with glass bonds. The thermal stability of the abrasive particles may be dependent, for example, upon the composition, particle chemistry, and processing conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> For example, as disclosed above, the fused abrasive particles according to the present invention have a first average microhardness of at least 11 GPa (preferably, at least 12, 13, or 14 GPa, more preferably, at least 15 GPa, and even more preferably, at least 16 GPa, at least 17 GPa, or even at least 18 GPa), wherein the abrasive particles have a second average microhardness after being heated in air at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4 hours, and wherein the second average microhardness is at least 85% (preferably, at least 90%; more preferably, at least 95%; and even more preferably, about 100%) of the first average microhardness (see Example 3 (below) for a more complete description of the test </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The thermal stability of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention may also be observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), wherein the average microstructure (e.g., porosity, crystal structure, colony size and crystal size (eutectic crystals, and primary crystals, if present) and integrity of the abrasive particles is examined before and after being heated at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4 hours. The microstructure of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention are essentially the same before and after being heated at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Further, the thermal stability of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention may also be illustrated by comparing the color of the abrasive particles before and after they are heated at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4 hours. The microstructure of preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention is essentially the same before and after being heated at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The thermal stability of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention may also be illustrated by comparing powder XRD result of the abrasive particles before and after they are heated at 1000&deg; C. in air for 4 hours. As discussed above, when alumina-zirconia eutectic material is heated in air, typically at least a portion of the zirconia undergoes a tetragonal and/or cubic to monoclinic phase transformation. The effect of this phase transformation is typically significant enough to be observed via powder XRD. By contrast, the eutectic phases of certain preferred abrasive particles according to the present invention do not exhibit such phase transformations when heated to 1000&deg; C. in air, hence no transformation of the eutectic phases will be observed in the XRD results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Fused abrasive particles according to the present invention can be used in conventional abrasive products, such as coated abrasive products, bonded abrasive products (including vitrified, resinoid, and metal bonded grinding wheels, cutoff wheels, mounted points, and honing stones), nonwoven abrasive products, and abrasive brushes. Typically, abrasive products (i.e., abrasive articles) include binder and abrasive particles, at least a portion of which is fused abrasive particles according to the present invention, secured within the abrasive product by the binder. Methods of making such abrasive products and using abrasive products are well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, fused abrasive particles according to the present invention can be used in abrasive applications that utilize abrasive particles, such as slurries of abrading compounds (e.g., polishing compounds), milling media, shot blast media, vibratory mill media, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Coated abrasive products generally include a backing, abrasive particles, and at least one binder to hold the abrasive particles onto the backing. The backing can be any suitable material, including cloth, polymeric film, fibre, nonwoven webs, paper, combinations thereof, and treated versions thereof. The binder can be any suitable binder, including an inorganic or organic binder (including thermally curable resins and radiation curable resins). The abrasive particles can be present in one layer or in two layers of the coated abrasive product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> An example of a coated abrasive product is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to this figure, coated abrasive product <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a backing (substrate) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and abrasive layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Abrasive layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes fused abrasive particles according to the present invention <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> secured to a major surface of backing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by make coat <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and size coat <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In some instances, a supersize coat (not shown) is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Bonded abrasive products typically include a shaped mass of abrasive particles held together by an organic, metallic, or vitrified binder. Such shaped mass can be, for example, in the form of a wheel, such as a grinding wheel or cutoff wheel. The diameter of grinding wheels typically is about 1 cm to over 1 meter; the diameter of cut off wheels about 1 cm to over 80 cm (more typically 3 cm to about 50 cm). The cut off wheel thickness is typically about 0.5 mm to about 5 cm, more typically about 0.5 mm to about 2 cm. The shaped mass can also be in the form, for example, of a honing stone, segment, mounted point, disc (e.g. double disc grinder) or other conventional bonded abrasive shape. Bonded abrasive products typically comprise about 3-50% by volume bond material, about 30-90% by volume abrasive particles (or abrasive particle blends), up to 50% by volume additives (including grinding aids), and up to 70% by volume pores, based on the total volume of the bonded abrasive product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A preferred form is a grinding wheel. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, grinding wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted, which includes fused abrasive particles according to the present invention <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, molded in a wheel and mounted on hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Nonwoven abrasive products typically include an open porous lofty polymer filament structure having fused abrasive particles according to the present invention distributed throughout the structure and adherently bonded therein by an organic binder. Examples of filaments include polyester fibers, polyamide fibers, and polyaramid fibers. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> schematic depiction, enlarged about 100&times;, of a typical nonwoven abrasive product is provided. Such a nonwoven abrasive product comprises fibrous mat <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a substrate, onto which fused abrasive particles according to the present invention <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are adhered by binder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Useful abrasive brushes include those having a plurality of bristles unitary with a backing (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,427,595 (Pihl et al.), 5,443,906 (Pihl et al.), 5,679,067 (Johnson et al.), and 5,903,951 (Ionta et al.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Preferably, such brushes are made by injection molding a mixture of polymer and abrasive particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Suitable organic binders for making abrasive products include thermosetting organic polymers. Examples of suitable thermosetting organic polymers include phenolic resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, urethane resins, acrylate resins, polyester resins, aminoplast resins having pendant &agr;,&bgr;-unsaturated carbonyl groups, epoxy resins, acrylated urethane, acrylated epoxies, and combinations thereof. The binder and/or abrasive product may also include additives such as fibers, lubricants, wetting agents, thixotropic materials, surfactants, pigments, dyes, antistatic agents (e.g., carbon black, vanadium oxide, graphite, etc.), coupling agents (e.g., silanes, titanates, zircoaluminates, etc.), plasticizers, suspending agents, and the like. The amounts of these optional additives are selected to provide the desired properties. The coupling agents can improve adhesion to the abrasive particles and/or filler. The binder chemistry may thermally cured, radiation cured or combinations thereof. Additional details on binder chemistry may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,588,419 (Caul et al.), 4,751,137 (Tumey et al.), and 5,436,063 (Follett et al.), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> More specifically with regard to vitrified bonded abrasives, vitreous bonding materials, which exhibit an amorphous structure and are typically hard, are well known in the art. In some cases, the vitreous bonding material includes crystalline phases. Bonded, vitrified abrasive products according to the present invention may be in the shape of a wheel (including cut off wheels), honing stone, mounted pointed or other conventional bonded abrasive shape. A preferred vitrified bonded abrasive product according to the present invention is a grinding wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Examples of metal oxides that are used to form vitreous bonding materials include: silica, silicates, alumina, soda, calcia, potassia, titania, iron oxide, zinc oxide, lithium oxide, magnesia, boria, aluminum silicate, borosilicate glass, lithium aluminum silicate, combinations thereof, and the like. Typically, vitreous bonding materials can be formed from composition comprising from 10 to 100% glass frit, although more typically the composition comprises 20% to 80% glass frit, or 30% to 70% glass frit. The remaining portion of the vitreous bonding material can be a non-frit material. Alternatively, the vitreous bond may be derived from a non-frit containing composition. Vitreous bonding materials are typically matured at a temperature(s) in the range from about 700&deg; C. to about 1500&deg; C., usually in the range from about 800&deg; C. to about 1300&deg; C., sometimes in the range from about 900&deg; C. to about 1200&deg; C., or even in the range from about 950&deg; C. to about 1100&deg; C. The actual temperature at which the bond is matured depends, for example, on the particular bond chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Preferred vitrified bonding materials may include those comprising silica, alumina (preferably, at least 10 percent by weight alumina), and boria (preferably, at least 10 percent by weight boria). In most cases the vitrified bonding material further comprise alkali metal oxide(s) (e.g., Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) (in some cases at least 10 percent by weight alkali metal oxide(s)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Binder materials may also contain filler materials or grinding aids, typically in the form of a particulate material. Typically, the particulate materials are inorganic materials. Examples of useful fillers for this invention include: metal carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate (e.g., chalk, calcite, marl, travertine, marble and limestone), calcium magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate), silica (e.g., quartz, glass beads, glass bubbles and glass fibers) silicates (e.g., talc, clays, (montmorillonite) feldspar, mica, calcium silicate, calcium metasilicate, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium silicate) metal sulfates (e.g., calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, sodium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate), gypsum, vermiculite, wood flour, aluminum trihydrate, carbon black, metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide (lime), aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide), and metal sulfites (e.g., calcium sulfite). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In general, the addition of a grinding aid increases the useful life of the abrasive product. A grinding aid is a material that has a significant effect on the chemical and physical processes of abrading, which results in improved performance. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that a grinding aid(s) will (a) decrease the friction between the abrasive particles and the workpiece being abraded, (b) prevent the abrasive particles from &ldquo;capping&rdquo; (i.e., prevent metal particles from becoming welded to the tops of the abrasive particles), or at least reduce the tendency of abrasive particles to cap, (c) decrease the interface temperature between the abrasive particles and the workpiece, or (d) decreases the grinding forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Grinding aids encompass a wide variety of different materials and can be inorganic or organic based. Examples of chemical groups of grinding aids include waxes, organic halide compounds, halide salts and metals and their alloys. The organic halide compounds will typically break down during abrading and release a halogen acid or a gaseous halide compound. Examples of such materials include chlorinated waxes like tetrachloronaphtalene, pentachloronaphthalene, and polyvinyl chloride. Examples of halide salts include sodium chloride, potassium cryolite, sodium cryolite, ammonium cryolite, potassium tetrafluoroboate, sodium tetrafluoroborate, silicon fluorides, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride. Examples of metals include, tin, lead, bismuth, cobalt, antimony, cadmium, and iron titanium. Other miscellaneous grinding aids include sulfur, organic sulfur compounds, graphite, and metallic sulfides. It is also within the scope of the present invention to use a combination of different grinding aids, and in some instances this may produce a synergistic effect. The preferred grinding aid is cryolite; the most preferred grinding aid is potassium tetrafluoroborate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Grinding aids can be particularly useful in coated abrasive and bonded abrasive products. In coated abrasive products, grinding aid is typically used in the supersize coat, which is applied over the surface of the abrasive particles. Sometimes, however, the grinding aid is added to the size coat. Typically, the amount of grinding aid incorporated into coated abrasive products are about 50-300 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(preferably, about 80-160 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). In vitrified bonded abrasive products grinding aid is typically impregnated into the pores of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The abrasive products can contain 100% fused abrasive particles according to the present invention, or blends of such abrasive particles with other abrasive particles and/or diluent particles. However, at least about 2% by weight, preferably at least about 5% by weight, and more preferably about 30-100% by weight, of the abrasive particles in the abrasive products should be abrasive particles according to the present invention. In some instances, the abrasive particles according the present invention may be blended with another abrasive particles and/or diluent particles at a ratio between 5 to 75% by weight, about 25 to 75% by weight about 40 to 60% by weight, or about 50% to 50% by weight (i.e., in equal amounts by weight). Examples of suitable conventional abrasive particles include fused aluminum oxide (including white fused alumina, heat-treated aluminum oxide and brown aluminum oxide), silicon carbide, boron carbide, titanium carbide, diamond, cubic boron nitride, garnet, fused alumina-zirconia, and sol-gel-derived abrasive particles, and the like. The sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be seeded or non-seeded. Likewise, the sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be randomly shaped or have a shape associated with them, such as a rod or a triangle. Examples of sol gel abrasive particles include those described U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,314,827 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,518,397 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,623,364 (Cottringer et al.), 4,744,802 (Schwabel), 4,770,671 (Monroe et al.), 4,881,951 (Wood et al.), 5,011,508 (Wald et al.), 5,090,968 (Pellow), 5,139,978 (Wood), 5,201,916 (Berg et al.), 5,227,104 (Bauer), 5,366,523 (Rowenhorst et al.), 5,429,647 (Larmie), 5,498,269 (Larmie), and 5,551,963 (Larmie), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additional details concerning sintered alumina abrasive particles made by using alumina powders as a raw material source can also be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,259,147 (Falz), 5,593,467 (Monroe), and 5,665,127 (Moltgen), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some instances, blends of abrasive particles may result in an abrasive article that exhibits improved grinding performance in comparison with abrasive articles comprising 100% of either type of abrasive particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> If there is a blend of abrasive particles, the abrasive particle types forming the blend may be of the same size. Alternatively, the abrasive particle types may be of different particle sizes. For example, the larger sized abrasive particles may be abrasive particles according to the present invention, with the smaller sized particles being another abrasive particle type. Conversely, for example, the smaller sized abrasive particles may be abrasive particles according to the present invention, with the larger sized particles being another abrasive particle type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable diluent particles include marble, gypsum, flint, silica, iron oxide, aluminum silicate, glass (including glass bubbles and glass beads), alumina bubbles, alumina beads and diluent agglomerates. Fused abrasive particles according to the present invention can also be combined in or with abrasive agglomerates. Abrasive agglomerate particles typically comprise a plurality of abrasive particles, a binder, and optional additives. The binder may be organic and/or inorganic. Abrasive agglomerates may be randomly shape or have a predetermined shape associated with them. The shape may be a block, cylinder, pyramid, coin, square, or the like. Abrasive agglomerate particles typically have particle sizes ranging from about 100 to about 5000 micrometers, typically about 250 to about 2500 micrometers. Additional details regarding abrasive agglomerate particles may be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,311,489 (Kressner), 4,652,275 (Bloecher et al.), 4,799,939 (Bloecher et al.), 5,549,962 (Holmes et al.), and 5,975,988 (Christianson), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The abrasive particles may be uniformly distributed in the abrasive article or concentrated in selected areas or portions of the abrasive article. For example, in a coated abrasive, there may be two layers of abrasive particles. The first layer comprises abrasive particles other than abrasive particles according to the present invention, and the second (outermost) layer comprises abrasive particles according to the present invention. Likewise in a bonded abrasive, there may be two distinct sections of the grinding wheel. The outermost section may comprise abrasive particles according to the present invention, whereas the innermost section does not. Alternatively, abrasive particles according to the present invention may be uniformly distributed throughout the bonded abrasive article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Further details regarding coated abrasive products can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,734,104 (Broberg), 4,737,163 (Larkey), 5,203,884 (Buchanan et al.), 5,152,917 (Pieper et al.), 5,378,251 (Culler et al.), 5,417,726 (Stout et al.), 5,436,063 (Follett et al.), 5,496,386 (Broberg et al.), 5,609,706 (Benedict et al.), 5,520,711 (Helmin), 5,954,844 (Law et al.), 5,961,674 (Gagliardi et al.), and 5,975,988 (Christinason), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Methods for abrading with abrasive particles according to the present invention range from snagging (i.e., high pressure high stock removal) to polishing (e.g., polishing medical implants with coated abrasive belts), wherein the latter is typically done with finer grades (e.g., less ANSI 220 and finer) of abrasive particles. The abrasive particle may also be used in precision abrading applications, such as grinding cam shafts with vitrified bonded wheels. The size of the abrasive particles used for a particular abrading application will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Abrading with abrasive particles according to the present invention may be done dry or wet. For wet abrading, the liquid may be introduced supplied in the form of a light mist to complete flood. Examples of commonly used liquids include: water, water-soluble oil, organic lubricant, and emulsions. The liquid may serve to reduce the heat associated with abrading and/or act as a lubricant. The liquid may contain minor amounts of additives such as bactericide, antifoaming agents, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Abrasive particles according to the present invention may be used to abrade workpieces such as aluminum metal, carbon steels, mild steels, tool steels, stainless steel, hardened steel, titanium, glass, ceramics, wood, wood like materials, paint, painted surfaces, organic coated surfaces and the like. The applied force during abrading typically ranges from about 1 to about 100 kilograms. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> A polyethylene bottle was charged with 187.2 grams of alumina powder (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;APA-0.5&rdquo; from Condea Vista, Tucson, Ariz.), 112.9 grams of yttrium oxide powder (obtained from H. C. Starck, Newton, Mass.), 0.6 gram of a dispersing agent (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;DURAMAX D-30005&rdquo; from Rohm and Haas Company, Dear Park, Tex.), and 100.4 grams of distilled water. The powders were present in amounts to provide 78.6 mole % Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and 21.4 mole % Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. About 450 grams of alumina milling media (10 mm diameter; 99.9% alumina; obtained from Union Process, Akron, Ohio) were added to the bottle, and the mixture was milled for 4 hours to thoroughly mix the ingredients. After the milling, the milling media were removed and the slurry was poured onto a glass (&ldquo;PYREX&rdquo;) pan where it was dried using a heat-gun held approximately 46 cm (18 inches) above the pan. The pan was slowly oscillated while drying to prevent the settling of the powder prior to complete drying. After drying with the heat-gun, the pan was placed in a drying oven for an additional 30 minutes at 90&deg; C. to more completely dry the material. The dried powder bed was then scored with a spatula and scraped from the-pan to form small flakes of material. Each flake weighed about 0.5 to 3 grams. The flakes were calcined in air by heating them to 670&deg; C. at rate of about 1&deg; C./min., and then holding them at 670&deg; C. for 1 hour, after which the power to the furnace power was shut-off, and the furnace allowed to cool back to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Several of the calcined flakes were melted in an arc discharge furnace (Model No. 1-VAMF-20-22-45; from Advanced Vacuum Systems, Ayer, Mass.). About 15 grams of the calcined flakes were placed on the chilled copper plate located inside a furnace chamber. The furnace chamber was evacuated and then backfilled with Argon gas at a 260 torr pressure. An arc was struck between an electrode and a plate. The temperatures generated by the arc discharge were high enough to quickly melt the calcined flakes. After melting was complete, the material was maintained in a molten state for about 30 seconds to homogenize the melt. The resultant melt was rapidly cooled by shutting off the arc and allowing the melt to cool on its own. Rapid cooling was ensured by small mass of a sample and a large heat sinking capability of a chilled copper plate. The fused material was removed from the furnace within one minute after the power to the furnace was turned off. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is estimated that the cooling rate of the melt on the surface of the water chilled copper plate was 1500&deg; C./min. The fused material was white-green in color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrograph of a polished section of fused Example 1 material. The polished section was prepared using conventional mounting and polishing techniques. Polishing was done using a polisher (obtained from Buehler of Lake Bluff, Ill. under the trade designation &ldquo;ECOMET 3 TYPE POLISHER-GRINDER&rdquo;). The sample was polished for about 3 minutes with a diamond wheel, followed by three minutes of polishing with each of 45, 30, 15, 9, and 3 micrometer diamond slurries. The polished sample was coated with a thin layer of gold-palladium and viewed using JEOL SEM (Model JSM 840A). Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the photomicrograph shows a cutectic-derived microstructure comprising a plurality of colonies. The colonies were about 10-40 micrometers in size. Based on powder x-ray diffraction of a portion of Example 1 material, and examination of the polished sample using SEM in the backscattered mode, it is believed that the white portions in the photomicrograph were crystalline Y<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, and the dark portions &agr;-Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The widths of these phases observed in the polished section were up to about 1 micrometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Example 1 fused material was crushed by using a &ldquo;Chipmunk&rdquo; jaw crusher (Type VD, manufactured by BICO Inc., Burbank, Calif.) into (abrasive) particles and graded to retain the &minus;25&plus;30 and &minus;30&plus;35 mesh fractions (USA Standard Testing Sieves). These two mesh fractions were combined to provide a 50/50 blend. Thirty grams of the 50/50 blend of &minus;25&plus;30 and &minus;30&plus;35 mesh fractions were incorporated into a coated abrasive disc. The coated abrasive disc was made according to conventional procedures. The fused abrasive particles were bonded to 17.8 cm diameter, 0.8 mm thick vulcanized fiber backings (having a 2.2 cm diameter center hole) using a conventional calcium carbonate-filled phenolic make resin (48% resole phenolic resin, 52% calcium carbonate, diluted to 81% solids with water and glycol ether) and a conventional cryolite-filled phenolic size resin (32% resole phenolic resin, 2% iron oxide, 66% cryolite, diluted to 78% solids with water and glycol ether). The wet make resin weight was about 185 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Immediately after the make coat was applied, the fused abrasive particles were electrostatically coated. The make resin was precured for 120 minutes at 88&deg; C. Then the cryolite-filled phenolic size coat was coated over the make coat and abrasive particles. The wet size weight was about 850 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The size resin was cured for 12 hours at 99&deg; C. The coated abrasive disc was flexed prior to testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The average microhardnesses of Example 1 abrasive particles were measured by mounting loose abrasive particles (about 10 mesh in size) in mounting resin (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;EPOMET&rdquo; from Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, Ill.). The resulting cylinder of resin was about 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter and about 1.9 cm (0.75 inch) tall. The mounted samples were polished using a conventional grinder/polisher (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;EPOMET&rdquo; from Buehler Ltd.) and conventional diamond slurries with the final polishing step using a 1 micrometer diamond slurry (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;METADI&rdquo; from Buehler Ltd.) to obtain polished cross-sections of the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The microhardness measurements were made using a conventional microhardness tester (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;MITUTOYO MVK-VL&rdquo; from Mitutoyo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a Vickers indenter using a 500-gram indent load. The microhardness measurements were made according to the guidelines stated in ASTM Test Method E384 Test Methods for Microhardness of Materials (1991), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The microhardness values were an average of 20 measurements. The average microhardness was 16.2 GPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Several Example 1 abrasive particles were heated placed in a platinum crucible and heated to 1000&deg; C. at 50&deg; C./hour, held at 1000&deg; C. for 4 hours (in air), and then cooled to room temperature at about 100&deg; C./hour. The color of the abrasive particles after heating was the same as before heating (i.e., white-green). The average microhardness of the abrasive particles after heating was 16.1 GPa. The polished cross-sections prepared for the microhardness measurements were examined using the SEM in the secondary electron mode. The microstructure observed after heating was substantially the same as the microstructure observed before heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Several Example 1 abrasive particles were also heated placed in a platinum crucible and heated to 1000&deg; C. at 50&deg; C./hour, held at 1000&deg; C. for 8 hours (in air), and then cooled to room temperature at about 100C./hour. The color of the abrasive particles after heating was the same as before heating (i.e., white-green). The average microhardness of the abrasive particles after heating was 16.0 GPa. The polished cross-sections prepared for the microhardness measurements were examined using the SEM in the secondary electron mode. The microstructure observed after heating was substantially the same as the microstructure observed before heating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The average microhardness of Comparative Example B abrasive particles was determined, as described above in Example 1, to be 16.0 GPa. The color of the Comparative Example B abrasive particles was gray-navy blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Several Comparative Example B abrasive particles were heated placed in a platinum crucible and heated to 1000&deg; C. at 50&deg; C./hour, held at 1000&deg; C. for 4 hours (in air), and then cooled to room temperature at about 100&deg; C./hour. The color of the abrasive particles after heating was beige. The average microhardness of the abrasive particles after heating was 12.9 GPa. The polished cross-sections prepared for the microhardness measurements were examined using the SEM in the secondary electron mode. An SEM photomicrograph a Comparative Example B abrasive particle before heating is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. An SEM photomicrograph a Comparative Example B abrasive particle after heating is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The microstructure observed after heating was different than that observed before heating. The differences were observed most predominately at the colony boundaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Further powder x-ray diffraction (using a Phillips XRG 3100 x-ray diffractometer with copper K al radiation of 1.54050 Angstrom) was used to qualitatively measure the phases present in Comparative Example B abrasive particles before and after the above described heat-treatment by comparing the peak intensities of 111 of cubic and/or tetragonal reflection at about 2&thgr;&equals;30 degrees, to that of 111 of monoclinic reflection at about 2&thgr;&equals;28 degrees. For reference see &ldquo;Phase Analysis in Zirconia Systems,&rdquo; Garvie, R. C. and Nicholson, P. S., Journal of the American Ceramic Society, vol 55 (6), pp. 303-305, 1972, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The samples were ground and &minus;120 mesh powders used for analysis. The unheat-treated Comparative Example B abrasive particles contained both the monoclinic and cubic and/or tetragonal zirconia phases. For the heat-treated sample, a decrease in the cubic and/or tetragonal phase content with a corresponding increase in monoclinic phase content was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Several Comparative Example B abrasive particles were heated placed in a platinum crucible and heated to 1000&deg; C. at 50&deg; C./hour, held at 1000&deg; C. for 8 hours (in air), and then cooled to room temperature at about 100&deg; C./hour. The color of the abrasive particles after heating was beige. The average microhardness of the abrasive particles after heating was 12.8 GPa. The polished cross-sections prepared for the microhardness measurements were examined using the SEM in the secondary electron mode. An SEM photomicrograph a Comparative Example B abrasive particle after heating is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The microstructure observed after heating was different than that observed before heating.

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The effect of two vitrified bonding materials on Comparative Example B abrasive particles were evaluated as follows. A first vitrified bond material was prepared by charging a plastic jar (4 &frac38; inches (11 .1 cm) in diameter; 4 &frac38; inches (11.1 cm) in height) with 70 parts of a glass frit (37.9% SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 28.5% B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, 15.6% Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, 13.9% Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and 4.1% K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O; obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;FERRO FRIT 3227&rdquo; from Ferro Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio), 27 parts of Kentucky Ball Clay (No 6DC; obtained from Old Hickory Clay Company, Hickory, Ky.), 3.5 parts of Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Company, Ward Hill, Mass.), 3 parts CaSiO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Company), and 625 grams of 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) diameter plastic coated steel media, and then dry milling the contents at 90 rpm for 7 hours. The composition was formulated to provide a vitrified bond material comprising about 45% SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, about 19% Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, about 20% B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, about 10% Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, about 3% K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, about 1.5% Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and about 1.5% CaO. The dry milled material and Comparative Example B abrasive particles were pressed into a 3.2 cm&times;0.6 cm (1.25 inch&times;0.25 inch) pellet. The pellet was heated to 1000&deg; C. at 50&deg; C./hour, held at 1000&deg; C. for 8 hours (in air), and then cooled to room temperature at about 100&deg; C./hour. The pellet was prepared by mixing, in order, 20 parts of Comparative Example B abrasive particles (&minus;20&plus;30 mesh), 0.24 part of hydrolyzed starch (obtained under the trade designation &ldquo;DEXTRIN&rdquo; from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.), 0.02 part glycerine (obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company), 0.72 part water, 3.14 parts of the dry milled material, and 0.4 part of hydrolyzed starch (&ldquo;DEXTRIN&rdquo;). The pellet was pressed under a load of 2273 kilograms (5000 lbs.). The average microhardness of the abrasive particles after heating in the vitrified bonding material was 13.6 GPa, although some of the Comparative Example B abrasive particles exhibit such severe degradation that microhardness measurements could not be effectively made (portions of the particles were too weak). There was variability in the color of the heat-treated abrasive particles, although the majority of the particles were beige. The polished cross-sections prepared for the microhardness measurements were examined using the SEM in the secondary electron mode. An SEM photomicrograph a Comparative Example B abrasive particle after heating is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>.

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, the photomicrograph shows a eutectic-derived microstructure comprising a plurality of colonies. The colonies were about 5-30 micrometers in size. Based on powder x-ray diffraction of a portion of Example 3 material, and examination of the polished sample using SEM in the backscattered mode, it is believed that the white portions in the photomicrograph were crystalline cubic ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the gray portions crystalline Y<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, and the dark portions &agr;-Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The widths of these phases observed in the polished section were up to about 3 micrometers. Eutectic phases making up the colonies were in a lamellar arrangement. The alumina phases were seen as crystals exhibiting a trigonal shape. The orientation of at least a portion of the lamellar (i.e. orientation of eutectic crystallization) was observed to follow the orientation of the alumina in trigonal outline which was evident by an approximately 120 degree angle at which adjacent lamellar run into each other. While not wishing to be bounded by theory, it is believed that during crystallization of the melt of a composition at or near ternary eutectic, primary alumina crystallized first as a seed in a trigonal shape. The consequent coupled growth of eutectic in the form of lamellar followed, at least initially, the orientation of the seed. A eutectic colony then included alumina seeds of the same orientation (or a single seed) together with the eutectic lamellar growth. Further, it was observed that the colony boundaries did not exhibit phase coarsening as was observed in the binary eutectic (manifested by the significant coarsening of crystals of eutectic phases in an immediate vicinity of colony boundary) of Example 1. </paragraph>
