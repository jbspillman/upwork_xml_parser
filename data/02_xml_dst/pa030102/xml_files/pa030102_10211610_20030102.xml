<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In an optical transmission and reception module, a partitioning member separating a light emitting device and a light receiving device from each other includes a partitioning plate having a concave surface, an engaging portion to which the partitioning plate is fixed, a holding portion holding the engaging portion movably, and a leaf spring for pressing the engaging portion against an optical plug. An end surface of an optical fiber is convex and projects from a front end of the optical plug. When the end surface of the optical plug is in contact with an engaging surface of the engaging portion, a gap is generated between the end surface of the optical fiber and a surface opposed thereto. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a bi-directional optical transmission and reception system for executing transmission and reception by using one-core optical fiber. The present invention also relates to an optical transmission and reception module and an optical cable for use in the optical transmission and reception system. In particular, the present invention relates a digital communication system such as IEEE 1394 and USB2 capable of making high-speed transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A plastic optical fiber cable has been hitherto used in optical communication at home. The plastic optical fiber cable is flexible, can be wired easily, and costs low. Therefore, audio digital signals are actually transmitted in domestic networks, such as audiovisual devices and personal computers, through the plastic optical fiber cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> At home, it is expected that various factors such as rearrangement of furniture in a room cause frequent alteration of wiring of the optical fiber cable, accompanied with the removal and installation of an optical plug and/or elongation of the optical fiber cable. It is also expected that a user switches a communication medium, depending on use conditions. That is, in a short-distance low-speed communication, optical spatial transmission will be used, whereas in long-distance high-speed communication, the optical fiber cable will be used. To meet the need, development of optical transmission and reception systems are being made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The protocols (communication methods) in the optical transmission and reception system are classified into a full duplex communication method and a half duplex communication method. The former is capable of accomplishing transmission and reception simultaneously, whereas the latter is incapable of accomplishing reception unless transmission has terminated. It is conceivable that real time transmission of information will be mainly made even at home in the near future. Thus, the construction of the optical transmission and reception system adopting the full duplex communication method is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As an example of a conventional optical transmission and reception module for realizing such an optical transmission and reception system, an optical transmission and reception module proposed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-248429 is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The optical transmission and reception module is intended to be compact and inexpensive by adopting the Foucault prism as an optical branching element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the proposed optical transmission and reception module, transmission light T emitted by a light emitting element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> transmits through a cover glass <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> installed on a package and is divided into halves by a Foucault prism <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. After condensed by a condenser lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a half is coupled to, or incident on, an optical fiber <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> through a rod lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, reception light rays R discharged from an optical fiber <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> having the rod lens <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> disposed at its front end are condensed by the condenser lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, incident on the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and then divided into halves. After they pass through the cover glass <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, only a half is coupled to a light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the disposition relationship between the light emitting element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> forces the light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to be located at a position apart from the condensed point of the reception light R. Accordingly, to detect the diverged reception light R, it is necessary to prepare a large light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the electrostatic capacity of the light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is large. Thus it is difficult to realize a high-speed communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The limitative position of the light receiving element <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be caused by that the light-condensing system consists of the single condenser lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> interposed between the optical fiber <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and that the vertical angle of the Foucault prism is as small as 2-3 degrees, as described in a paragraph denoted by &lsqb;0018&rsqb; of the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-248429. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As another prior art example, there is an optical transmission and reception module proposed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-39181, which module carries out optical transmission and reception through one optical fiber by the half duplex communication method, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the optical transmission and reception module, half of transmission light rays T emitted by a laser diode LD serving as a light emitting element are reflected from a 50%-beam splitter film BS formed on a prism <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> provided on a light receiving element PD, condensed by a lens <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and connected to an optical fiber <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, half of reception light rays R discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> pass through the beam splitter film BS and are connected to the light receiving element PD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This prior art is advantageous in that one optical fiber is used to carry out the optical transmission and reception by the half duplex communication method. However, because light is branched by means of the beam splitter film BS formed on the prism <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the optical amount is reduced to half in each of the transmission and the reception. Thus, the optical transmission and reception module is not suitable for a long-distance transmission and reception of an optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As still another prior art example, there is an optical transmission and reception module proposed in the literature &ldquo;Miniaturized Transceiver using Simplex POF for IEEE 1394 (International POF Conference &apos;99, pages 205-208)&rdquo;. The optical transmission and reception module carries out optical transmission and reception through one optical fiber by the full duplex communication method, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the optical transmission and reception module, transmission light rays T are emitted by an LD serving as the light emitting element, condensed by a cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, reflected from a reflection film <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> (99%) formed on a prism <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and converged. The converged light is connected to, or incident on, an end surface of the optical fiber. On the other hand, reception light rays R are discharged from the optical fiber and are mostly connected to a photodiode PD, although a part of the light rays R is lost by the reflection film <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. According to the method, because the light rays are connected to the optical fiber, with the light rays converged, in principle, Fresnel light on the end surface of the optical fiber is not connected to the photodiode PD. Thus, the full duplex transmission and reception can be accomplished with one optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has merits because it can accomplish transmission and reception by using one optical fiber, has only a small light loss in a transmission time, and the transmission light T and the reception light R can be almost completely separated from each other, i.e., the full duplex optical system can be realized. However, in the prior art, the reflection film <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is formed on the prism, and the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed on the reflection film <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. That is, a large number of processes are required in the stage of preparing the optical branching elements. Consequently, the manufacturing cost is high. Further, because the reception light rays R do not pass through a lens, the light receiving element PD is required to be large. Consequently, the electrostatic capacity of the light receiving element PD is large. That is, the conventional art is unsuitable for high-speed communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Sharp Kabushiki Kaisha has proposed an optical transmission and reception system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> in the Japanese Patent Application No. 11-5872 (filed on Jan. 12, 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception system, it is possible to use a digital audio optical fiber cable which has already spread, and execute two-way communication through one optical cable having one-core optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception system has an optical cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and an optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The optical cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has in its inside a one-core optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> serving as the optical path, and has a plug <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at both ends thereof. The plug <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is connected to the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The holding member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, of the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, having an insertion hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>houses a light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> converting an electrical signal into an optical signal, a light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> converting an optical signal into an electrical signal, a mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> sealing the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, lenses <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and an optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The optical cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are optically connected to each other by inserting the plug <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the optical cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> into the insertion hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> More specifically, transmission light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> transmit through the lens <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, so as to be collimated with one another. Then, the collimated light rays are deflected to the optical-axis direction of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by a microprism formed on the surface of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and are incident on the optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, light rays discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are deflected by the microprism formed on the surface of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, transmit through the lens <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed integrally with the mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as condensed light rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, the optical transmission and reception module and the light transmission and reception system using it have the following problems, which will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 1) Because the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are sealed in the single mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> travels along a path L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the mold package <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to be incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As a result, high crosstalk is generated, and this makes impossible to carry out the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 2) Because the light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the light rays to be received by the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are deflected by the same optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> within the module, the light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are reflected from the optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and are incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> along a path L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, high crosstalk is generated and thus it becomes impossible to carry out the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 3) Because the same optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is used as both the transmission line for the optical signal from the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the transmission line for the optical signal to the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the signal light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are reflected from both end surfaces of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and are incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> along a path L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, high crosstalk is generated, which makes impossible to carry out the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 4) The optical transmission and reception module is optically connected to its counterpart via the optical fiber <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, supposing that the optical transmission and reception module and its counterpart (on the left-hand side of the figure) have the same construction, the light rays emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> will be reflected by an optical branching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the counterpart and then incident on the light receiving element along a path L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As a result, high crosstalk will be generated and thus it will be impossible to carry out the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As a prior art light-branching device, there is one disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 64-45805. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, in the light-branching device, a pair of bare optical fibers <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> are combined with each other with a reflection film <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of a predetermined length disposed therebetween. The end surfaces of the bare optical fibers <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> combined with each other are coaxially disposed in opposition to the end surface of a transmission-line optical fiber <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the case where the light-branching device is used as the light-branching element for an optical transmission and reception module, a problem occurs. The problem is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 1) Each time the optical fiber <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is connected to the light-branching device and disconnected therefrom, the transmission-line optical fiber <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> contacts the bare optical fibers <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the light-branching device at their end surfaces confronting the optical fiber <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the mutually confronting end surfaces of the bare optical fibers <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and transmission-line optical fiber <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> will be damaged. Thus, the transmittances thereof deteriorate. </paragraph>

The reflected light, which is an optical transmission signal emitted by a light emitting element of a counterpart of the pertinent module, will be incident on a light receiving element of the counterpart. In the case where the counterpart has the same construction as that of the pertinent optical transmission and reception module, reflected light is generated also on the end surface of a reflection film of the counterpart, and the reflected light of transmission light emitted by the light emitting element of the pertinent optical transmission and reception module will be incident on the light receiving element of the same. Consequently, crosstalk will be high and it will be impossible to carry out the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In view of the problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical transmission and reception system suppressing crosstalk and allowing optical transmission and reception to be accomplished by a full duplex communication method, as well as providing an optical transmission and reception module and an optical plug for the optical transmission and reception system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> There is provided, according to an aspect of the invention, an optical transmission and reception module for duplex-communication performing optical transmission and reception through an identical optical fiber, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> a light emitting element for emitting transmission light; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> a light receiving element for receiving reception light; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> a transmission optical system disposed in a position that falls between the light emitting element and an end surface of the optical fiber when the optical fiber is in place in the module; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> a reception optical system disposed in a position that falls between the light receiving element and the end surface of the optical fiber when the optical fiber is in place in the module; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> a Foucault prism having: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> a first inclined surface for refracting the transmission light coming from the light emitting element and taken out by the transmission optical system, and coupling the refracted transmission light to the end surface of the optical fiber; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> a second inclined surface for refracting at least part of the reception light discharged from the optical fiber, and coupling the refracted reception light to the light receiving element through the reception optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the transmission light taken out from the light emitting element through the optical system is refracted only by the first inclined surface of the Foucault prism. Thus, in principle, loss of light does not occur on the Foucault prism and thus the transmission light can be efficiently connected or coupled to the optical fiber. Further, most of return light rays including principle light rays generated by Fresnel reflection in connecting the transmission light to the optical fiber return to the first inclined surface of the Foucault prism. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the amount of the transmission light that enters the light receiving element of the module at the transmission end. Accordingly, a highly efficient optical communication can be realized in the optical transmission and reception module to be used for the full duplex communication schemes that carry out optical transmission and reception simultaneously. Further, using the Foucault prism having the above configuration as a branching element can reduce the size of the optical transmission and reception module in the longitudinal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At least one of the light emitting element and the light receiving element may be sealed with a resin, and the resin may form a lens of the transmission optical system or the reception optical system on a straight line connecting a light emitting surface or a light receiving surface to the corresponding inclined surface of the Foucault prism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> For example, the light emitting element and/or the light receiving element can be resin-molded, and in the resin-molding process a lens can be integrally formed so as to be directed toward the corresponding inclined surface (first and/or second inclined surface) of the Foucault prism. By thus doing, transmission efficiency and/or reception efficiency can be improved. Further, if the periphery of the light emitting element is sealed with the resin, the critical angle at a resin-air interface is increased. Thus, the light take-out efficiency can also be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The light emitting element and the light receiving element may be mounted on an identical substrate which is disposed, for example, on a plane almost parallel to the Foucault prism. By thus doing, the mounting process steps for the individual elements can be facilitated. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the number of manufacturing process steps and shorten working period of time, and further facilitate the positioning of the substrate relative to the optical transmission and reception module. Eventually, the mass-production price can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Both the light emitting element and the light receiving element may be sealed with a resin, and the resin may form lenses of each of the transmission optical system and the reception optical system on straight lines connecting each of a light emitting surface and a light receiving surface to the first and second inclined surfaces of the Foucault prism, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For example, the light emitting element and the light receiving element can be resin-molded, and in the resin-molding process lenses can be integrally formed so as to be directed toward their respective associated inclined surfaces of the Foucault prism. By thus doing, both the transmission efficiency and the reception efficiency can be improved. Further, because the periphery of the light emitting element is sealed with the resin, the critical angle at a resin-air interface is increased. Thus, light take-out efficiency is also improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A condenser lens for use in both transmission and reception operations is provided between the Foucault prism and the light emitting and receiving elements. In this case, in a transmission time, the transmission optical system such as a lens is not required to converge light rays coming from the light emitting element. That is, the condenser lens converts light rays, even diffused light rays, coming from the transmission optical system into converged light rays. This arrangement provides against the dislocation of the optical fiber relative to a transmission part of the module. On the other hand, in a reception time, light rays discharged from an end of the optical fiber diffuse or spread at an angle determined by the NA value (numerical aperture) of the optical fiber. Thus, the light rays refracted by the Foucault prism will also diffuse. However, before they diffuse, they are collimated with one another by the condenser lens. Then, they are coupled to the light receiving element with the aide of the reception optical system such as a lens. Accordingly, it is possible to greatly improve efficiency in the reception time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The Foucault prism and the condenser lens may be formed integrally by, for example, injection molding. By thus doing, it is possible to reduce the number of component parts and thus reduce the number of manufacturing process steps and shorten a working time period, which makes it possible to reduce the cost for manufacturing the optical transmission and reception module. It is also possible to suppress Fresnel reflected light which would be generated in the interface between the condenser lens and the Foucault prism if they are provided separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If a partitioning member is interposed between a transmission part and a reception part of the module, it is possible to prevent the transmission light from being directly connected as turbulent light to the light receiving element. Thereby, the S/N ratio at the light receiving element can be improved. Accordingly, a high-quality full duplex communication system can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The partitioning member may, preferably, be movable in a principal axis direction of the optical fiber when the partitioning member comes into contact with or strikes against an end surface of the optical fiber. This arrangement can be achieved by, for example, by providing the partitioning member, such as a partitioning plate, with a jig such as a spring that allows the partitioning plate to move to the depth of the module when the end surface of the optical fiber comes into contact with the partitioning plate. The movable partitioning plate enables to prevent the end surface of the optical fiber from being damaged by the contact with the partitioning plate. Thus, efficiency in optical transmission and reception is prevented from deteriorating due to the damage of the optical fiber end surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The partitioning member may, preferably, have an optical reflecting property. For example, by using a light-tight plate, or light-screening plate, as the partitioning member, having a sufficiently high reflectance or reflectivity of 80% or higher for the transmission light and the reception light, it is possible to effectively utilize as the reception light even such light as would be absorbed in a light reception time if the partitioning member has a surface having a high absorptivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an end surface of the partitioning member confronting the end surface of the optical fiber may have an optical absorbing property. For example, a light-tight plate whose end surface has a sufficiently high absorptivity of 80% or higher for the transmission light and the reception light can be used as the partitioning member. Then, it is possible to reduce a so-called a &ldquo;far-side reflection&rdquo;, namely the reflection of the transmission signal at the side of a counterpart module currently serving as the reception end (in this case the reflection is caused by an end surface of the partitioning member in the counterpart module). Thus, the S/N ratio at the light receiving element can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A curvature of the lens, formed of the sealing resin, of the transmission optical system may be so set that a bundle of convergent light rays falling within a numerical aperture is incident on the end surface of the optical fiber. Alternatively or additionally, a curvature of the condenser lens may be so set that a bundle of convergent light rays falling within a numerical aperture is incident on the end surface of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> By thus making the transmission light incident on the end surface of the optical fiber at an angle such that the transmission light becomes convergent light of a size corresponding to the NA value of the optical fiber or smaller, it is possible to prevent Fresnel reflected light off the near-side end surface of the optical fiber from disadvantageously entering the light receiving element in the module serving now as the transmission end. Thus, the S/N ratio at the light receiving element can be improved. In other words, the utilization efficiency of the transmission light emitted by the light emitting element can be improved to a higher extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> There is also provided, according to another aspect of the invention, An optical transmission and reception module, comprising a light emitting element emitting transmission light and a light receiving element receiving reception light, for transmitting and receiving the light by using an identical one-core optical fiber, further comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> a light-tight partitioning plate touching an end surface of the optical fiber when the optical fiber is in place in the module, and separating an optical path of the transmission light and that of the reception light from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, it is possible to prevent the transmission light emitted by the light emitting element from being reflected by the near-side end surface of the optical fiber (namely, the end surface near this module of the optical fiber) to eventually enter the light receiving element of the same module. Thus, it is possible to suppress crosstalk caused by the influence of the reflection of the transmission light by the near-side end surface of the optical fiber. As a result, optical transmission can be accomplished by the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the partitioning plate is located at a position where the partitioning plate is pressed by the end surface of the optical fiber when the optical fiber is fitted into the module, and the partitioning plate is elastically deformable when pressed by the end surface of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, even though there are variations in installed length of optical fibers because of molding variations, it is possible to absorb the variations by the mounted position and the elastic deformation of the partitioning plate. Thus, the partitioning plate does not fail to be in contact with the near-side end surface of the optical fiber. Accordingly, irrespective of the variations in installed length of optical fibers, crosstalk caused by the influence of the reflection of the transmission light by the near-side end surface of the optical fiber can be suppressed, so that optical transmission can be accomplished by the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The partitioning plate may have a partitioning portion touching the end surface of the optical fiber and an elastically deformable portion that elastically deforms when the partitioning plate is pressed by the end surface of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, even though the end surface of the optical fiber presses the partitioning portion, the partitioning portion is prevented from being slid laterally on the optical fiber end surface or deformed into an arcuate shape. Further, it is possible to prevent the partitioning plate from rubbing against the end surface of the optical fiber or striking a corner of the partitioning plate against the end surface of the optical fiber. Thus, the end surface of the optical fiber is prevented from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a light absorbing layer is formed on a contact surface of the partitioning plate that touches the end surface of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> With the construction, it is possible to prevent transmission light coming from an associated module, which is connected with the pertinent module through the optical fiber, from being reflected by the contact surface of the partitioning plate and entering the light receiving element of the associated module. Consequently, it is possible to suppress crosstalk at the associated module caused by the influence of light reflected from the contact surface of the partitioning plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The partitioning plate may be extended toward the light emitting and receiving elements such that the partitioning plate is interposed between optical elements provided between the end surface of the optical fiber and each of the light emitting and receiving elements, and/or interposed between the light receiving element and the light emitting element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the construction, it is possible to prevent the transmission light emitted by the light emitting element and reflected from the rear surfaces of the optical elements in the module from entering the light receiving element of the same module. Alternatively or additionally, it is possible to cut off the transmission light propagating toward the light receiving element in the same module through, for example, a mold package sealing the light emitting and receiving elements. Thus, such transmission light does not enter the receiving-element in the same module. That is, it is possible to suppress crosstalk caused by the influence of the light reflected by the rear surfaces of the optical elements or the light propagating in the mold package in the module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the partitioning plate may be formed of an electrically conductive material and an electrical potential of the partitioning plate is set to a ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With the construction, it is possible to prevent an inductive coupling between the light emitting element and the light receiving element in the same module and thus suppress crosstalk caused by the influence of the inductive coupling in this module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, optical elements are disposed between the end surface of the optical fiber and each of the light emitting and receiving elements, and an anti-reflection film is formed on an optical-fiber-side surface of each optical element </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> With the construction, it is possible to prevent the transmission light emitted by a light emitting element in an associated module from being reflected by the surfaces of the optical elements to disadvantageously enter a light receiving element of the associated module. That is, it is possible to suppress crosstalk in the associated module caused by the influence of the light reflected by the surfaces of the optical elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Each optical element disposed between the light emitting and receiving elements and the near-side end surface of the optical fiber may comprise an optical deflection element, and the light receiving element and the light emitting element may be inclined relative to optical axes of the optical deflection elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This arrangement prevents the transmission light emitted by a light emitting element of an associated module, or a counterpart of the present module, from being reflected by the light emitting element and the light receiving element of the present module to enter a light receiving element of the associated module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is also provide comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module as described above combined with an optical cable having a one-core optical fiber inside constitutes an optical transmission and reception system. In this system, the optical fiber has inclined end surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this system, it is possible to prevent the transmission light sent from one end surface of the optical fiber from being reflected from the other end surface thereof to enter a light receiving element of a module in which the other end surface of the optical fiber is received. Consequently, it is possible to suppress crosstalk caused by the influence of light reflected by the far-side end surface of the optical fiber (namely, the end surface at the side far from the relevant module). Thus, optical transmission can be accomplished by the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical transmission and reception system in which the partitioning plate is in contact the end surface of the optical fiber, when the optical plug is rotated, with the end surface of the optical fiber in contact with the partitioning plate, there is a possibility that the end surface of the optical fiber and/or the partitioning plate is broken. To avoid this, it is necessary to provide the optical plug and the optical transmission and reception module with an anti-rotation mechanism. The anti-rotation mechanism can be realized by, for example, providing the optical plug with a key while providing the optical transmission and reception module with a keyway. However, unless the anti-rotation key is fitted in the keyway of the optical transmission and reception module, the optical plug cannot be inserted into the optical transmission and reception module. This is an inconvenience to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is another object of the present invention to provide an optical transmission and reception module which uses a light-tight partitioning plate to enable an optical transmission according to the full-duplex communication method, as well as providing an optical cable and an optical transmission and reception system using the module and the optical fiber, in which rotation of an optical plug in the optical transmission and reception module causes damages to neither the end surface of the optical fiber nor the partitioning plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> To achieve this object, there is provided, according to a further aspect of the invention, an optical transmission and reception module, comprising a light emitting element emitting transmission light and a light receiving element receiving reception light, for transmitting and receiving the light by using an identical one-core optical fiber, further comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> a light-tight partitioning member separating an optical path of the transmission light and that of the reception light from each other, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> wherein the partitioning member has an opposed surface to be opposed to an end surface of the optical fiber, with a gap left between the partitioning member and an end surface of the optical fiber, when the optical fiber is in place in the module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With the above construction, when the optical plug accommodating the optical fiber is mounted inside the optical transmission and reception module, there is a gap between the end surface of the optical fiber and the opposed surface of the partitioning member confronting the end surface of the optical fiber. Thus, these mutually confronting surfaces do not contact each other even when the optical plug rotates. Thus, it is possible to prevent these members from being damaged. Therefore, it is unnecessary to provide the optical transmission and reception module and the optical plug with any anti-rotation mechanism. Thus, the user can fit the optical plug in the optical transmission and reception module easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> From the viewpoint of the optical transmission by the full duplex communication method, the gap (G) may be, preferably, in the range of 0 mm&lt;G&lt;0.3 mm, and more preferably about 0.2 mm. When the gap lies in this range, the bit error rate (BER) can be reduced to 1E-12 (i.e., 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>), although depending somewhat on the optical system, and hence it is possible to achieve optical transmission by the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The partitioning member may have a positioning means for, when the optical fiber is placed in position in the module, positioning the opposed surface relative to the end surface of the optical fiber such that the gap is constant. By providing the partitioning member with the positioning means, the dimension of the gap between the end surface of the optical fiber and the opposed surface of the partitioning member is prevented from changing each time the optical plug is inserted in the optical transmission and reception module. Accordingly, it is possible to carry out full duplex communication stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the positioning means comprises an engaging surface to touch an end surface of an optical plug holding the optical fiber therein, and the engaging surface has a fixed positional relationship with the opposed surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the positioning means comprises an engaging surface to touch a portion of the end surface of the optical fiber through which portion light does not pass, and the engaging surface has a fixed positional relationship with the opposed surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to use a slippery material, namely, a material having a low coefficient of sliding friction for the engaging surface. Even though the optical plug is rotated a lot of times, the contact portion is hardly broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The partitioning member may have a spring means urging the engaging surface toward the optical fiber. In this case, the engaging surface is pressed against the end surface of the optical plug or a portion of the end surface of the optical fiber through which light does not pass. Thus, it is possible to prevent the dimension of the gap from being varied while the optical plug is in the module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the partitioning member comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> a partitioning plate disposed between the light emitting element and the light receiving element and having the opposed surface; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> an engaging portion to which the partitioning plate is fixed and which has the engaging surface; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> a holding portion holding the engaging portion such that the engaging portion is movable in a direction of an optical axis of the optical fiber, the holding portion having a spring means for urging the engaging portion to the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, when a comparatively long optical plug is inserted in the module, the engaging portion moves toward the bottom of the module (to the side opposite to a plug insertion hole) from an initial position against the spring force of the spring means, while the engaging portion is being held by the holding portion. As a result, the engaging surface moves toward the bottom of the module from the initial position. Accordingly, by setting a position corresponding to a conceivable shortest length of the optical plug as an initial position of the engaging portion in consideration of variations (tolerance) of the length of optical plugs in a manufacturing stage, the movement of the engaging portion absorbs the variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the engaging portion has a generally truncated-cone-shaped hole and receives a front end of the optical plug having an optical fiber in the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the opposed surface of the partitioning member is complementary in shape to the end surface of the optical fiber, the dimension of the gap can be reliably allowed to be constant over the entire end surface of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention provides an optical cable having a one-core optical fiber passed therethrough, wherein each of end surfaces of the optical fiber is a curved surface rotationally symmetrical about an optical axis of the optical fiber. Use of such an optical cable prevents transmission light sent from one end surface of the optical fiber from being reflected by the other end surface thereof to be back to the one end surface and eventually enter the light receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The rotationally symmetrical curved surface is, for example, a convex surface. Alternatively, it may be a cone-shaped surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A combination of any of the optical transmission and reception modules and the optical cable can provide an optical transmission and reception system which are not subject to damages of the optical fiber and the partitioning member due to the rotation of the optical plug in the module, which reliably accomplishes the full duplex optical communication, and which provides a convenience to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Each end surface of the optical fiber may project from a plug provided at opposite ends of the optical fiber, and a radially outward portion of the end surface of the optical fiber may cover a part of an end surface of the plug. The structure of the end surfaces of the optical fiber may be adopted especially in the embodiment in which the engaging surface of the partitioning member touches a portion of the end surface of the optical fiber through which light does not pass. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of main parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception module, a full duplex communication method is adopted to perform both an optical transmission and an optical reception by using one optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accommodated in an optical plug <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The optical transmission and reception module includes a Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a first inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for refracting transmission light taken out from a laser diode (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;LD&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a light emitting element and making the transmission light incident on an end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> almost perpendicularly thereto, and a second inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for refracting about a half of reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and making the reception light incident on a light receiving photodiode (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;receiving PD&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serving as a light receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sealed with a mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that forms a lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which constitutes a receiving optical system. The LD <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a monitoring photodiode (PD) <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are mounted on a sub-mount <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the sub-mount <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are mounted on a substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> disposed within a plane substantially parallel to the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, no lens is interposed between the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The reception light reaches the second inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>directly from the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, whereas the transmission light reaches the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> directly from the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the optical transmission and reception module does not have a transmitting optical system. This is because the LD <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used as the light emitting element. That is, because light emitted by the LD is not so divergent as light emitted by an LED, it is unnecessary to provide the optical transmission and reception module with the transmitting optical system. In other words, the LD itself has the function of the transmitting optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be shaped by injection molding method or the like. It is desirable to select a weather-resistant material for forming the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For example, ARTON-FX manufactured by JSR Corporation (Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.), ZEONEX manufactured by Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd., and the like can be used as the material of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. From the viewpoint of the moldability of the material in a processing time, it is desirable to form a die with an appropriate tapered angle at a portion corresponding to a peripheral portion of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is sealed with the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a transfer molding method or the like. A weather-resistant material is suitable for forming the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, similarly to the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A material consisting of epoxy resin, for example, CEL-T-2000 manufactured by Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd. is preferably used as the material of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In sealing the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to form the spherical or aspherical lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>above the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> obliquely relative thereto to greatly improve the coupling efficiency of the reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. From the viewpoint of the moldability of the material of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a processing time, it is desirable to form a die with an appropriate tapered angle at a portion corresponding to a peripheral portion of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment, after the transmission light emitted by the LD <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is refracted by the first inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the transmission light is connected to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, about half the reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is refracted by the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and then connected to the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As is obvious from the above, it is possible to accomplish an optical transmission and reception using one optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, namely, full duplex communication by interposing the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having the first and second inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>between the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the LD <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> serving as the light emitting element as well as the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serving as the light receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of main parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The parts, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, same as or similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference numerals as those used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment except that a light emitting diode (LED) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is used as a light emitting element, that both the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are sealed with the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and that the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed with a lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>a constituting a transmission optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is mounted on a sub-mount <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;. The receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the sub-mount <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; are mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> disposed in a plane substantially parallel to the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are sealed with the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the transfer molding method or the like. A weather-resistant material is suitable for forming the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, similarly to the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A material consisting of epoxy resin, for example, CEL-T-2000 of Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd. is preferably used as the material of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In sealing the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, preferably, spherical or aspherical lens portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed obliquely relative to the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to thereby greatly improve the connection or coupling efficiency of the transmission light to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and that of the reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. From the viewpoint of the moldability of the material of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in a processing time, it is desirable to form a die with an appropriate tapered angle in a portion corresponding to a peripheral portion of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment, after the transmission light emitted by the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is refracted first by the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and then by the first inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the transmission light is coupled to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, about half the reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is refracted by the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As is obvious from the above, it is possible to accomplish an optical transmission and reception using one optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, namely, full duplex communication by interposing the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having the first and second inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>between the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; serving as the light emitting element as well as the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serving as the light receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the LED is used as the light emitting element. The LED has a characteristic that the emission of the LED is lower in directivity and spreads in a spatially wider angle than the LD. Thus, even though the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided obliquely relative to the principal light ray of the LED, light emitted by the LED can be efficiently utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> That is, according to the second embodiment, the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is a light source emitting light spatially spreading relatively widely, is used as the light emitting element. Thus, the optical transmission and reception module of this embodiment costs lower than the one using a laser diode. In addition, light rays other than the principal light ray of the light emitting element can be effectively connected to the first inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to thereby improve the transmission efficiency. Further, because it is unnecessary to direct the light emitting element LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; toward the first inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is possible to facilitate a chip-mounting operation to thereby reduce a mass-production price. Optical transmission and reception modules using an LED of other embodiments, which will be described later, have also the advantages of the second embodiment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the third embodiment is similar to that of the second embodiment except that in the third embodiment, the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is not mounted on the sub-mount, but is mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> along with the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> That is, in the third embodiment, the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are mounted on the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> forming the lens portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>covers them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> According to the third embodiment, a printed wiring board or a lead frame is used as the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Because the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are mounted on the same substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is easy to perform mounting works such as a die-bonding work, a wire-bonding work, and the like in mass-production. Further, in the third embodiment, the number of component parts can be reduced. In addition, because it is unnecessary to mount the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on different members, it is expected that the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be positioned with high accuracy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of main or essential parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the fourth embodiment is similar to that of the third embodiment, except that in the fourth embodiment, a condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is placed alongside the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the side of the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and that the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a configuration different from that of the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> That is, in the fourth embodiment, the optical transmission and reception module has the condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed on the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at a position substantially corresponding to the position of boundary between the first and second inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to make the reception part of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> nearer to the condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> than the transmission part thereof. The construction contributes to improvement of the efficiency in the optical transmission and reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be spherical or aspherical. The lens surface may face the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth embodiment, in a light receiving time, the reception light discharged from the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be connected to the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is the light receiving element, without the reception light diffusing. In a light transmitting time, it is unnecessary to connect the transmission light to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with only the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Therefore, light take-out efficiency can be improved by increasing the radius of curvature of the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Fifth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of main parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the fifth embodiment is similar to that of the fourth embodiment, except that in the fifth embodiment, the Foucault prism and the condenser lens are integral with each other to form a lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> That is, in the fifth embodiment, the Foucault prism and the condenser lens are integrally molded out of a resinous material, such as the one mentioned in the first embodiment, by injection molding method or the like to form the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. The lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; has inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>similar to the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first through fourth embodiments, and a lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a function similar to that of the condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment. Instead of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment, the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is disposed in the optical transmission and reception module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> According to the fifth embodiment, because the number of component parts can be reduced, assembly of component parts can be simplified and facilitated. Further, it is possible to suppress Fresnel reflected light which would be generated in the interface between the condenser lens and the Foucault prism in the case where they are provided separately. Thus, it is possible to accomplish a highly efficient optical transmission and reception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Sixth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A, 13B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> schematically show the construction of main or essential parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception module of the sixth embodiment, the curvature of the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and that of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are so set that a convergent bundle of light rays falling within the numerical aperture (NA) value of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is incident on an end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, if light incident on the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is diffused light, the Fresnel reflected light generated on the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will assume a diffused state, and a part of the Fresnel reflected light will be incident on the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a light receiving element. Thus, it is difficult to carry out the full duplex communication method. On the other hand, if light incident on the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is convergent light, the Fresnel reflected light generated on the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> returns to the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; along the outgoing path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an example of various settings for the constituent parts including the radius of curvature of the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and that of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; which have been determined in consideration of the above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the above example, the position of the boundary between the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is coincident with the center of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> According to the result of an optical simulation conducted on the optical transmission and reception module having the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the optical transmission efficiency of the optical system was 14.5%, the light reception efficiency thereof was 34.5%, and the returned light was 0.365%. The percentage of the returned light of the optical transmission and reception module can be reduced to about {fraction (1/3)} of that of the returned light of the prism array-adopted optical transmission and reception module proposed by Sharp Kabushiki Kaisha in the Japanese Patent Application No. 11-201047. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The radius of curvature of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Whether the transmission light is successfully incident on the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> depends on the curvature of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. Thus, the curvature of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; will be discussed, supposing that light rays collimated by the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are incident on the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> To make light incident on the optical fiber and propagate the light through the optical fiber, it is known that there is a relationship (1) between the numerical aperture NA of the optical fiber and the focal length F of a collimating lens: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>NA&equals;</italic></highlight>0.5/<highlight><italic>F </italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The relationship between the focal length F of a plano-convex lens and the radius of curvature R of the spherical portion thereof is expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>F&equals;</italic></highlight>2<highlight><italic>R </italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> From the equations (1) and (2), an equation R&equals;0.25/NA is obtained. Because the NA value of a normally used optical fiber (made of plastic) is 0.3 or less, a satisfactory characteristic can be obtained when the radius of curvature R is 0.84 mm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the radius of curvature R of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably 0.84 mm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> A light ray tracking simulation was conducted on the case where diffused light rays were taken out from the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and collimated by the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. As a result, it was found that converged light could be obtained when the radius of curvature R of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;c of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; was 1.45 mm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> From the above, it is preferable that the radius of curvature R of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is 0.84 mm or more but 1.45 mm or less (0.84 mm&lE;R&lE;1.45 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The radius of curvature R of the lens portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is also applicable to the condenser lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> not integral with the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as in the fourth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> According to the sixth embodiment, it is possible to prevent the returned light from being connected to the light receiving element without deteriorating efficiency in the optical transmission and reception. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the seventh embodiment is similar to that of the fifth embodiment, except that in the seventh embodiment, a partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> serving as a partitioning member is disposed between the transmission part and the reception part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> extends from the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> toward the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is very close to the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is preferable that the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is made of a thin and strong material such as phosphorus-bronze of a thickness of 50 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> According to the seventh embodiment, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> prevents the transmission light from diffusing to the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serving as the light receiving element and contributes to improvement of the S/N ratio of the reception light. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of essential parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the eighth embodiment is similar to that of the seventh embodiment, except that in the eighth embodiment, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is movable substantially in an axial direction of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> touches and presses the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> That is, when the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> touches and presses the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> moves toward the depth of the module (downward as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> As shown in a plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the spring-like partitioning plate (elastic partitioning plate) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be formed by half-etching a phosphorus-bronze plate having a thickness of 50 &mgr;m, cutting it along a cutting line <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and bending the phosphorus-bronze plate along a bending line <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (elastic partitioning plate) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is fixed to the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> into a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> by inserting screws from outside of the substrate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> into screwing holes <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> According to the eighth embodiment, even if the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> touches the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> due to insertion and removal of the optical plug, it is possible to prevent the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from being subjected to damage which otherwise would cause the efficiency of the optical transmission and reception to be deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Ninth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> schematically shows the construction of main parts of an optical transmission and reception module according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the ninth embodiment is similar to the seventh embodiment, except that the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the ninth embodiment has optical reflectiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> As described above, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> greatly reduces the amount of light rays (turbulent light) coupled to the receiving PD (light receiving element) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the interior of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> prevents the transmission light from being radiated toward the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the S/N of the reception light can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Further, by making the reflectance of the surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> high, namely, by using a partitioning plate having a high reflectance as the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, it is possible to effectively utilize, as the reception light, even light components which would be absorbed into the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> at the time of reception if the surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has a high absorptivity, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is allowed to-have the optical reflecting property by, for example, using a substance having a high reflectance, such as aluminum, as the material of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> itself, or coating the side surfaces of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with a thin film of a material such as a metal having a high reflectance by a liquid phase method (e.g., gold plating) or a gaseous or vapor phase method (vacuum deposition, sputtering, or the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the result of a simulation about the change of light reception efficiency when the reflectance of the surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is changed. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> indicates, as the reflectance of the surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> becomes higher, the light reception efficiency increases. For example, there is a difference of about 0.7 dB in the light reception efficiency between the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> whose surface is entirely coated with black paint (reflectance is 0%) and the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> whose surface is evaporated with aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the ninth embodiment, by using the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> having a high reflectance, it is possible to effectively utilize, as the reception light, light components which would be absorbed by the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> when the absorptivity of the surface thereof is high. The use of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> having a high reflectance is particularly effective when the transmission light and the reception light have the same wavelength band. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module according to a tenth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of a region A surrounded with a broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module of the tenth embodiment is similar to the seventh embodiment, except that the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the tenth embodiment has light-absorbing property at an end surface thereof confronting the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> If optical communication is made between the pertinent module and its counterpart, or associated module as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, and if the end surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in each module has a high reflectance and is flat, then a part Lt of transmission light from the pertinent module that has reached the counterpart will be reflected by the end surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in the counterpart module and return to the pertinent module. Therefore, in the pertinent module, even though near-side reflection caused by turbulent light and Fresnel returned light within this module is removed, the amount of light returned from the associated module is large. Thus, it is impossible to improve S/N ratio at the light receiving element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the 10th embodiment, the absorptivity of the end surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is increased by, for example, coating the end surface with black paint to suppress the far-side reflection occurring in the associated module. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> That is, to allow the optical disposition to be more advantageous to the transmission part than to the reception part, namely, to improve the efficiency at the transmission part, the inclination of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be more gentle than that of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as if the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>became parallel to the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference>. Alternatively, to allow the optical disposition to be more advantageous to the reception part than to the transmission part, namely, to improve the efficiency at the reception part, the inclination of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be more gentle than that of the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as if the inclined surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>became parallel to the end surface of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</cross-reference>. Such setting of the inclination is optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In the preceding embodiments, the inclinations of the first inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are almost equal to the inclinations of the second inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, because it is assumed that component parts such as a chip capacitor and the like are interposed between the LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and the receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Regarding the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, for improvement of efficiency of both the optical transmission and reception, it may be advantageous to form the lens portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> directly above the chips (LED <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; and receiving PD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and reduce the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;. To realize the full duplex communication system, however, it is desirable to interpose the partitioning member (partitioning plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) between the transmission side and the reception side to intercept light. Thus, it is impossible to provide the LED chip in a position near the center of the substrate in view of the disposition of the lens portions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the mounting of the chip. Taking the above into consideration, it is preferable to set the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; to 15 degrees or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> When the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; is increased, a light amount that can be utilized as the transmission light is reduced because it is necessary to utilize oblique transmission light emitted from the lens portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mold resin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> To examine this, a simulation was conducted in a predetermined condition. The vertical angle was set to 60 degrees as in the case of the first through tenth embodiments. As a result, the efficiency in the optical transmission and reception was lower by 0.8 dB than the efficiency in the optical transmission in the case where vertical light was utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In the case where the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; was further increased, the efficiency in the optical transmission was much lower. When the vertical angle was set to 75 degrees, the efficiency in the optical transmission was lower by 1.5 dB than the efficiency in the optical transmission in the case where the vertical light was utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> To obtain a satisfactory characteristic in a similar condition, the tolerable reduction of the efficiency in the optical transmission as compared when the vertical light is utilized is maximum about 1.8 dB. Thus, the vertical angle of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; are preferably set to 75 degrees or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> From the above, it is preferable to set the vertical angle &thgr; of the Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that of the lens-integrated Foucault prism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; to between <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> degrees and 75 degrees inclusive (15 degrees&lE;&thgr;&lE;75 degrees). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The first through 11th embodiments can be carried out in an appropriate combination thereof and applied to the half duplex communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> 12th Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the optical transmission and reception module according to a 12th embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is a plan view of the optical transmission and reception module from which an upper lid has been removed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a rear view of the optical transmission and reception module from which a lower lid and a substrate have been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The outline of the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the 12th embodiment will be described below. The optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a receptacle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for holding a plug (described later) accommodating a one-core optical fiber when the plug is inserted into an insertion hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>an optical branching element (optical element) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a sealed optical element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a first shield <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> made of an electrically conductive material and covering the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having a sealed light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a second shield <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of an electrically conductive material and covering the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which touches an end surface of the optical fiber at a center of the end surface such that the end surface of the optical plug is divided into two parts. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> also separates an optical path of transmission light and that of reception light from each other, and is movable in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber. The optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a driving IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a third shield <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> covering the driving IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an amplifying IC <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for amplifying a signal of the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a fourth shield <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> covering the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; a substrate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as a printed wiring board, for providing electrical wiring for the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the driving IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, external input/output terminals <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>; a lower lid <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and an upper lid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. An anti-reflection film is formed on surfaces of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is produced by soldering the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a lead frame consisting of a silver-plated copper plate, using silver paste or indium, to electrically connect the lead frame and the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to each other by wire bonding, and then transfer-molding a semi-finished product composed of the lead frame and the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a die. A lens, namely, an optical element is integrally molded with a mold package at a top surface thereof at the time of the transfer-molding process. The light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is produced in a similar way but by replacing the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> When a transmission signal (electrical signal) is inputted to the optical transmission and reception module through the external input/output terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is driven by the driving IC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and transmission light rays (optical signal) are emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The transmission light rays are substantially collimated by the lens formed on the surface of the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The collimated light rays enter the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, with the optical path of the collimated light deflected, the collimated light gets incident on the optical fiber. In this case, if some of the transmission light rays deviate from the optical path because of dislocation of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, those transmission light rays do not enter the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This is because the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is extended to the position at which the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> crosses a line connecting the light emitting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Also, transmission light rays reflected from an end surface, of the optical fiber, near to the optical transmission and reception module (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;near-side end surface&rdquo;) will not enter the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> either because of the presence of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Further, the transmission light rays which have been transmitted through the optical fiber are partly reflected by an end surface, of the optical fiber, far from the optical transmission and reception module (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;far-side end surface&rdquo;). But such reflected light will disappear without being transmitted back through the optical fiber because the far-side end surface of the optical fiber inclines by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> degrees, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The transmission light rays discharged from the far-side end surface of the optical fiber enter an associated optical transmission and reception module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Supposing that the associated optical transmission and reception module has the same construction as that of the present pertinent optical transmission and reception module (In the figures, same reference numerals are used for both modules.), the transmission light rays reach an inclined contact surface, of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which touches the end surface of the optical fiber. But the transmission light rays are not reflected by the inclined contact surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> because the inclined contact surface is coated with a light-absorbing material (e.g., black paint containing carbon). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Then, the transmission light rays reach the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, at which they are not reflected either because the surface of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is coated with an anti-reflection film. The transmission light rays incident on the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are deflected in their optical paths, condensed by a lens formed on the surface of the light receiving device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and enter the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Light rays incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are partly reflected off. However, because the light rays are obliquely incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, they are reflected obliquely in a direction opposite to the incident direction and thus do not return to the optical branching element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the light rays incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are photoelectrically converted into electrical signals. The electrical signals are amplified by the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and taken out as reception signals to the outside of the optical transmission and reception module through the external input/output terminal <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> To realize the full duplex communication method, it is necessary to minimize the amount of a transmission signal that is mixed with a reception signal in the identical module. For example, to set a bit error rate (BER) to 1E-12 (i.e., 10 to the minus 12th power), 11.5 dB is required in S/N ratio. To this end, it is necessary to reduce both electrical crosstalk and optical crosstalk. A shield plate, which is per se known, is effective for reducing the electrical crosstalk, whereas a partitioning plate is effective for reducing the optical crosstalk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, by contacting the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the end surface of the optical fiber and coating the end surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with optical absorbing paint, in appropriate combination with the measures as described above, such as applying the anti-reflection film to the optical devices, inclining the light receiving element and/or the light emitting element, etc, the value 1E-12 as BER has been accomplished to thereby enable an optical transmission and reception by the full duplex communication method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the 12th embodiment will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing an optical system of the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is in contact with the inclined end surface of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> accommodating the optical fiber. Thereby, the optical fiber disposed within the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are in contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The optical branching elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided at the transmission side and the reception side respectively. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is disposed at the boundary between the optical branching elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Microprisms are formed on the surface of each of the optical branching elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at regular intervals of 200 &mgr;m. The interval between the optical branching elements <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through which the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is inserted is set to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The first shield <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> consisting of a copper plate covers the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> other than the lens portion thereof. The second shield <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> consisting of a copper plate covers the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> other than the lens portion thereof. The first and second shields <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to the ground to reduce electrical crosstalk between the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> while preventing unnecessary incoming and outgoing light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Inductive coupling is generated through holes or openings of the first and second shields <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed at the lens portion of each of the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. To prevent such inductive coupling from occurring, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> not only is extended to the boundary between the light emitting device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the light receiving device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, but also is formed of an electrically conductive material, with the electric potential thereof dropped to the ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The principle of the spring (elastic deformation) structure of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> show an initial state of the contact of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference> show a terminal state of the contact of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 28A</cross-reference> are side views. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27B and 28B</cross-reference> are plan views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> There occur variations in the length of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> accommodating the optical fiber in a producing process. Thus, if the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is fixed to the receptacle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a gap will be generated between the near-side end surface of the optical fiber and the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, depending on the length of the optical plug. If the gap is generated, the transmission light sent from the module is reflected by the near-side end surface of the optical fiber back to the module, and eventually enters the light receiving element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therein. Thus, the optical crosstalk increases. According to the embodiment, no gap is generated irrespective of the length of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by allowing the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber owing to the spring structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</cross-reference> and pressing the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> against the end surface of the optical fiber with a slight force. That is, generation of the gap can be prevented by disposing the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> at a position where the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is pressed by the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (namely, the near-side end surface of the optical fiber) that has a minimum length. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> absorbs the variations in length of the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by its elastic deformation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception system described immediately before, the anti-rotation key <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed on the optical plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A, 31B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>D, the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the system includes a receptacle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> holding an optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> accommodating a one-core optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> when the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is inserted through an insertion hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a; </italic></highlight>a pair of optical branching elements (optical elements) <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> coated with an anti-reflection film, a light emitting device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having a sealed optical element <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a shield (not shown) made of an electrically conductive material and covering the light emitting device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a light receiving device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having a sealed light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a shield (not shown) made of an electrically conductive material and covering the light receiving device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> separating an optical path of transmission light and that of reception light from each other and movable in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber. The optical transmission and reception module also includes a driving IC <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for the light emitting element <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a substrate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as a printed wiring board (PWB), for providing electrical wiring for the driving IC <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a shield <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> covering the driving IC <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, an amplifying IC <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for amplifying a signal of the light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a substrate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> consisting of, for example, a PWB for providing electrical wiring for the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a shield <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> covering the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and external input/output terminals <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. In the shown example, the Foucault prism is used as the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> disposed between the light emitting device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the light receiving device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and between a pair of the optical branching elements <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, an engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to which one end of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is fixed, and a holding portion <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> holding the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and hence, the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> movably in the optical axis direction of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. As is clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33B and 33D</cross-reference>, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has, at its center, an approximately truncated cone-shaped hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for receiving the front end of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> smoothly, and an annular projection <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> formed at the bottom of the hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and projecting radially inwardly. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> consists of a phosphorus-bronze plate or a stainless steel plate about 50 &mgr;m thick and fixed to the bottom of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by insert molding. The partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has a concave surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at a side thereof confronting the hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The concave surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is coated with a light-absorbing material (e.g., black paint containing carbon). As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33C, a</cross-reference> leaf spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> consisting of a phosphorus-bronze plate or a stainless steel plate is fitted to the holding portion <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> by insert molding or press fit. The leaf spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> always urges the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> toward the plug insertion hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>namely, toward the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. The engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is slidably fit in a rectangular hole penetrating the holding portion <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Thus, if a force greater than the spring force of the leaf spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> acts on the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> fixed thereto move to the side opposite to the location of the plug insertion hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and an optical cable shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> constitute an optical transmission and reception system. The optical cable has an optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at both ends thereof (only one end is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>) and an optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> passes through the plugs. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> does not have an anti-rotation mechanism and is thus rotatable. An end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> projects from an end of the optical plug (ferrule). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34, a</cross-reference> radially outward portion of the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>covers a part of an end surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a curved surface which is rotationally symmetrical about the optical axis of the optical fiber. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is a convex. Because a light flux reflected from the curved surface spreads, the reflected light flux is absorbed into a cladding of the optical fiber while the light flux is propagating through the optical fiber. Consequently, the amount of reflected light discharged from the optical fiber is smaller than when the optical fiber has a flat end surface. The concave surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is complementary to the convex surface of the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> in the configurations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> As clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, when the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is inserted into the module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through the plug insertion hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the front end of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> fits in the hole <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and a portion of the plug end surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>not covered with the fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with a surface (engaging surface) <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the projection <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the relative positions of the front end of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and the partitioning plate are determined. At this time, a gap G having a dimension equivalent to the thickness of the projection <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is generated between the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is convex and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is concave to make the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>complementary to each other. Therefore, the dimension of the gap G is constant even in positions off the center of the optical fiber. Although the dimension of the gap G depends on the construction of an optical system, it is favorable to set the dimension of the gap G to less than 0.3 mm (0 mm&lt;G&lt;3 mm). It is favorable to set the dimension of the gap G as small as possible. In the 13th embodiment, the gap G is set to about 0.2 mm. It has been experimentally confirmed that when the gap G is about 0.2 mm, the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can reduce the bit error rate (BER) to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12 </superscript></highlight>and implement the full duplex communication method sufficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Because the leaf spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> urges the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> toward the plug insertion hole <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>namely, toward the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the engaging surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is always pressed against the plug end surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a slight force. Furthermore, the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is curved and rotationally symmetrical about the axis of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> rotates, the configuration of the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not change relative to the opposed concave surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>From these features, the dimension of the gap G is kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> containing the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> has variations in its length due to the manufacturing process. Thus, if the position of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is fixed by, for example, fixing the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the receptacle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the dimension of the gap G between the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the opposed concave surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may be larger than a preset dimension, depending on the length of the optical plug. For example, supposing that the optical plug is formed as a circular type in conformity to the standard EIAJ-RC5720B, the length of the optical plug is in the range of 14.7-15 mm due to variations caused by the manufacturing process. Supposing that the gap G is set to 0.2 mm, and that the position of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is fixed in conformity to a longest optical plug, the gap may assume a value of 0.5 mm for some optical plugs. However, in the 13th embodiment, a position corresponding to a conceivable shortest length of the optical plug is set as an initial position of the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (more specifically, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>), the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is movable in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and the leaf spring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> always presses the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against the end surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> with a slight force. Therefore, irrespective of the length of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the dimension of the gap G is kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Owing to the rotation of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the end surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical plug <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> slides on the engaging surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thus, it is preferable to compose the engaging surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a material having a low coefficient of sliding friction and a high resistance to abrasion, such as fluoroplastic or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The operation of the optical transmission and reception system having the above construction will be described below. When a transmission signal (an electrical signal) is supplied from outside to the optical transmission and reception module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through the input/output terminals <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the light emitting element <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is driven by the driving IC <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and transmission light (an optical signal) is emitted by the light emitting element <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The transmission light rays are substantially collimated by a lens <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> formed at a top surface of the light emitting device <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The collimated light enters the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As a result, with the path of the collimated light deflected, the collimated light enters the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Transmission light rays reflected by the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, near the optical transmission and reception module (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;near-side end surface&rdquo;) pass through the gap G between the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and enter the light receiving device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. At this time, because the gap G is as small as 0.2 mm, the amount of the incident light rays is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The transmission light rays which have been transmitted through the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are partly reflected from the other end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, far from the optical transmission and reception module (hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;far-side end surface&rdquo;). But, because the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is convex, the light flux reflected therefrom tends to spread, so that the reflected light flux is absorbed into the cladding of the optical fiber while the light flux is propagating through the fiber. Consequently, the amount of reflected light discharged from the near-side end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the transmission light rays discharged from the optical fiber far-side end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enter an associated optical transmission and reception module which is currently a receiving end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Supposing that the associated optical transmission and reception module of the currently receiving side has the same construction as that of the pertinent optical transmission and reception module (In the figures, same reference numerals are used for both modules.), the transmission light rays first reach the opposed surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the associated module. But the transmission light rays are not reflected by the opposed surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>because it is coated with a light-absorbing material (e.g., black paint containing carbon). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Then, the transmission light rays reach the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at which there occurs no reflection because the surface of the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is coated with an anti-reflection film. The transmission light incident on the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is deflected, and then condensed by a lens <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed at the surface of the light receiving device <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and finally enters the light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Light rays incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are partly reflected off. However, because the light rays are obliquely incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, they are reflected obliquely in a direction opposite to the incident direction and thus do not return to the optical branching element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the light rays incident on the light receiving element <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> are photoelectrically converted into electrical signals. The electrical signals are amplified by the amplifying IC <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and taken out as reception signals to the outside of the optical transmission and reception module through the external input/output terminals <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception system, generation of the electrical crosstalk is suppressed by using the shielding plate. In addition, the optical crosstalk is suppressed by using the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having the partitioning plate that confronts the end surface of the optical fiber with a very slight gap therebetween. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the optical transmission and reception by the full duplex communication method. Further, because the gap is provided between the partitioning plate and the end surface of the optical fiber, the optical fiber end surface and the partitioning plate are not damaged by the rotation of the optical plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In the optical transmission and reception system, the optical fiber end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is convex and the opposed surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is concave to allow the dimension of the gap G to be constant even in positions off the center of the optical fiber. However, a large gap is allowed, depending on the construction of an optical system. In such a case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the opposed surface of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may be a non-curved surface <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> The front end of the optical fiber may have a surface <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a conic shape, instead of the convex shape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, to keep the dimension of the gap G constant even in the positions off the center of the optical fiber, an opposed surface <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the partitioning plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has a shape complementary to the conic surface <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>As far as the end surface of the optical fiber is rotationally symmetrical about the axis of rotation of the plug, the amount of light reflected by this end surface is smaller than that of light reflected by a flat surface. Thus, the dimensions of the gap may be set according to the shape of the end of the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the optical transmission and reception system described above, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the partitioning member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> touches the end surface of the plug. Alternatively, the projection <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be made longer than the projection <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> so that the projection <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> touches the end surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber. In this case, the contact position of the optical fiber is limited to a region through which light does not pass. More specifically, in the case of an optical fiber whose cladding is 1 mm in diameter, the contact position on the optical fiber should be radially outward from the center of the optical fiber by more than 0.5 mm. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the gap G is adjusted to the same dimension as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> by making the thickness of the projection <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> smaller than that of the projection <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
