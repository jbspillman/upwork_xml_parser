<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A window assembly for garage doors with hingedly mounted panels. The assembly includes resilient male and female frame members that are brought towards each other to sandwich the borders of the door panel defining the window opening and the cooperatively dimensioned transparent panel. The male frame member includes, adjacent to its peripheral inner end, a peripherally extending leg member that is lockingly received within a cooperative channel notch on the transparent panel. The engagement of the leg member to the channel member permits certain deformation to be transmitter to the resilient male and female frame members. Fastening members are used to keep the male and female frame members securely against each other. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a window assembly, and more particularly, to a keyed window assembly for garage doors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many designs for window assemblies for garage doors have been designed in the past. None of them, however, include the features claimed herein that permit the present invention to withstand high winds and flying objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Garage doors typically include a number of hingedly connected panels that are moved from a vertical position to a horizontal overhead position over tracks. The window assemblies are typically positioned on the uppermost panels. They are designed to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the door while permitting daylight through. However, the window assemblies used in conventional garage doors include frames that cannot withstand high winds, such as those that develop in certain areas, such as South Florida. Local construction codes include wind tests that require reinforcements of these window assemblies and many times these added structures detract from the aesthetics of the window design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the present invention, as it will be more fully explained in the following paragraphs, provides for a simple window assembly that includes frame members that can be readily installed around the edges of the aperture defining the window. The claimed window assembly includes a transparent panel with a peripheral groove that cooperatively receives the edge of the male frame member. The assembly is thus capable of retaining the transparent panel while absorbing the impact energy of high winds and flying objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has been found that prior art window assemblies are typically rigid and the impact energy exposes its components to stress and shear forces that cause them to break. The present invention partially absorbs the impact energy through the limited deformation of its components. The transparent panel of the window, however, is still kept in place thereby preventing any wind or objects to come inside the protected premises or a breakaway situation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is one of the main objects of the present invention to provide a window assembly for garage door panels that is capable of withstanding high winds and flying objects by in part resiliently deforming its structure to absorb the impact energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a window assembly for garage door panels that is volumetrically efficient and does not detract from its aesthetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of this invention to provide such a device that is inexpensive to manufacture and maintain while retaining its effectiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further objects of the invention will be brought out in the following part of the specification, wherein detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the invention without placing limitations thereon.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, where the present invention is generally referred to with numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it can be observed that it basically includes garage door panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, male (interior) frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, female (exterior) frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, transparent panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and fastening member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Male and female members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are brought towards each other to sandwich panels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> along their respective and cooperative border areas. The engagement of resilient frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> permits the absorption of the impact energy generated by wind and flying objects through the partial deformation of panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference>; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, male frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has resilient characteristics and inner and outer longitudinal ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, respectively, and both extend peripherally around member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. End <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal protuberance <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> extending inwardly towards the interior of the protected dwelling. Protuberance <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is intended to enhance the structural integrity of male frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and it is formed on the inner surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime; of member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Opposite to protuberance <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and engaged to longitudinal peripheral edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, there is a longitudinally extending leg <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from outer surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Adjacent to end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, at predetermined positions, there are through openings <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> that permit self taping fastening members <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to go through. Peripheral channel <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extends adjacent to end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and co-acts with peripheral raised portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to sandwich panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> biting it with fastening members <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Female frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also has resilient characteristics and inner and outer longitudinal ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively. End <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a peripheral notch <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on inner surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; extending longitudinally at a predetermined distance and parallel to end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Outer longitudinal end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> coincides substantially with end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Outer surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&Prime; may include ornamentary designs. Peripheral notch <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> extends longitudinal inside raised portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and it is designed to receive sealant <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Transparent panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has cooperative dimensions, larger than aperture <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, that extend beyond inner ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> but stay within outer ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference>; <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Peripheral groove <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extends parallel to peripheral edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of panel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Groove <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> cooperatively and lockingly receives leg <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Upon the application of impact and wind forces on panels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, they are allowed to deform resilient male and female frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while maintaining the engagement of leg <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This mechanism has been the key to bear the extreme force applied at wind and impact testing laboratories. Upon release of these forces, the energy stored in members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also released bringing the structure back to its at rest configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description conveys the best understanding of the objectives and advantages of the present invention. Different embodiments may be made of the inventive concept of this invention. It is to be understood that all matter disclosed herein is to be interpreted merely as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
