<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an air-conditioning system that can be operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for a vehicle, having a high-pressure section which is connected to the output of a compressor and contains a gas cooler, having a low-pressure section which is connected to the suction side of the compressor and contains an evaporator, and having an expansion member connecting the high-pressure section and the low-pressure section. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve an optimum cooling performance and an optimum performance figure in air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(refrigerant R744), the known air-conditioning systems are provided with complicated controllers that control not only the compressor, but also the high pressure by means of an adjustable, expensive expansion valve, for which a high-pressure sensor is also needed. The high-pressure controller is considered to be necessary by those skilled in the art since the required cooling performance, which depends on the temperature of the external environment and on the desired cooling, can be implemented with an optimum performance figure at optimum high pressures associated with these performance figures. By means of the controlled expansion valve, it is desired to operate the air-conditioning system under any operating conditions at the high pressure at which the optimum of the cooling performance and the optimum of the performance figure (COP) is located. This achieves a situation where the air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are of equal value to or, to some extent are even superior to air-conditioning systems that are operated with other refrigerants, for example the refrigerant R134a. Although the air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are recognized to be more environmentally friendly than the air-conditioning systems operated with other refrigerants, considerably increased production costs oppose their practical implementation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on the object of providing an air-conditioning system of the type described above whose production costs are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved in that the expansion member provided is a fixed restrictor whose throttle opening is matched in terms of length and diameter to the system in such a way that under all operating conditions the pressure in the high-pressure section is limited to values of less than 14 MPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, it has been found that an air-conditioning system having a fixed restrictor designed in this way can be operated in the vicinity of the optima of cooling performance and performance figure, so that it is possible to dispense with an expensive expansion valve and its control. As a result, a considerable reduction in price can be implemented without noticeable penalties in relation to cooling performance and performance figure having to be tolerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a further refinement of the invention, a pressure limiting valve connected in parallel with the fixed restrictor is provided. The pressure limiting valve ensures that the maximum pressure occurring is limited to a value which lies somewhat above the pressure value set by the fixed restrictor, for example at 16 MPa. In an advantageous embodiment, provision is made for the pressure limiting valve and the fixed restrictor to be designed as one structural unit. This permits a relatively simple and correspondingly cost-effective expansion member to be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a further refinement of the invention, provision is made for the fixed restrictor to contain a switchable throttling element having at least two different throttle openings. The switchable throttling element may be adjusted, for example, as a function of the pressure and/or the temperature, so that in each case use is made of a suitable throttle opening having a predefined throttle cross section. It is therefore possible, by means of a simple controller to improve the air-conditioning system a little further in relation to the optima of cooling performance and performance figure. The same effect may be achieved if provision is made for two or more fixed restrictors connected in parallel which can be brought into use by means of an associated valve. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(carbon dioxide) has a relatively low critical temperature (31.1&deg; C.), so that an air-conditioning system operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>necessitates a process management which is modified by comparison with air-conditioning systems operated with other refrigerants, even when at first glance the air-conditioning system as such appears to be constructed very similarly. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an air-conditioning system contains a controllable compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The control of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is carried out by switching on and off, or by an internal controller or by an external adjustment of the compressor stroke. The compressor should have an isentropic efficiency of at least 0.6 and a volumetric efficiency of at least 0.6. An output of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to a high-pressure section, which contains a gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured such that it has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.7. The high-pressure section also contains an internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that receives the refrigerant from the gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and having a first output from which the refrigerant passes to an expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain effective operation of the air-conditioning system, high pressures up to 12 MPa and, if appropriate, up to 14 MPa are necessary in the high-pressure section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> By means of the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the refrigerant is expanded to pressures between 3.5 MPa and 5 MPa and then passes into a low-pressure section. This low-pressure section contains an evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is connected via an accumulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a suction side of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.7. The accumulator has a volume of more than 40 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, through whose first branch the refrigerant under high pressure flows and through whose second branch expanded refrigerant flows, has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.4. The lines that connect the individual elements to one another have an internal diameter of 2 mm to about 8 mm in the high-pressure section. The lines of the low-pressure section have a greater internal diameter, that is to say an internal diameter of about 3 mm to 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The circuit of the air-conditioning system is controlled by means of an electronic control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, into which a sensor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> inputs the temperature of the output air that has flowed through the evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged in the low-pressure line between the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the suction connection of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such sensor registering the level of the suction pressure and passing it on to the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. On the basis of these sensed values and of inputs of the ambient temperature and the desired cooling, control of the circuit is carried out by controlling the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a fixed restrictor that has a throttle opening with a predefined cross section and predetermined length. The length of the throttle opening and the cross section of the throttle opening are matched to the system in such a way that the maximum high pressure occurring under all operating conditions is limited to a maximum of 14 MPa in the high-pressure section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It has been found that, using a fixed restrictor designed in this way, it is possible to operate the air-conditioning system in the region of the optima for cooling performance and performance figure, which is completely adequate for the practical operation of an air-conditioning system for a motor vehicle. It is therefore sufficient for this air-conditioning system if only the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is controlled, so that a significant saving in costs is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The throttling action of the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designed as a fixed restrictor is determined by the length and the cross section of the throttle opening. For an air-conditioning system having an output of about 7 kW, a throttle opening with a length of about 10 mm and a cross section of about 1.0 mm is suitable. At higher outputs, the length and/or the cross section of the throttle opening must be adapted appropriately. This adaptation can be carried out empirically by means of trials following a rough calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the air-conditioning system according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is provided with a blower <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that, for example, is driven by an electric motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that can be operated in a number of output stages from the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To a restricted extent, adjustment or control of the high pressure is possible by means of appropriately changing the output of the blower <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and/or the flow delivered by the blower <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> through the gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the alternate embodiment according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> pressure limiting valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which limits the maximum pressure of the high-pressure section, is connected in parallel with the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designed as a fixed restrictor. The pressure limiting valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designed such that it opens at such pressures that lie somewhat above the pressures to which the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designed as a fixed restrictor limits the high pressure. For example an opening pressure of 16 MPa is provided for the pressure limiting valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designed as a fixed restrictor may be combined in a simple way with the pressure limiting valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to form one integral structural unit. An axially displaceable throttling member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is arranged in a housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is pressed against a seat <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by means of a compression spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The throttling member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided with a throttle opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> whose cross section and length are designed such that the high pressure occurring under all operating conditions is less than 14 MPa. The compression spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is biased or prestressed, by means of a setting screw or setting nut <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, such that as soon as an increased high pressure occurs, the throttling member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> lifts off the seat <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and opens a correspondingly large cross section and therefore limits the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a second alternate embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an expansion member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> contains a switchable throttling element, which is provided with a number of throttle openings that can each be brought alternatively into use, and are designed for different high pressures. For example, three throttle openings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are shown each having an outlet connected to an outlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the expansion member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Although three throttle openings are shown, two or four or more can be provided as desired. An inlet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the expansion member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected to an inlet of each of three valves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> respectively having an outlet connected to an inlet of an associated one of the throttle openings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The action of switching over the throttling element to the respectively suitable throttle opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is controlled by means of the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connected to the valves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, by which means different high-pressure ranges can be predefined. This action of switching over to one of the throttle openings is carried out on the basis of the pressure in the high-pressure section or else in the low-pressure section and/or the ambient temperature. In this way, it is possible to perform a certain degree of adaptation of the high pressure in the high-pressure section to the ambient temperature without complicated control of the throttle cross sections by means of an expansion valve, in order in this way to improve the cooling performance and the performance figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another alternate embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, two or more fixed restrictors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which, for example, are combined with a pressure limiting valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, are connected in parallel. Each of the fixed restrictors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with a different throttle opening, these being designed for different high pressures. These fixed restrictors are assigned one or more shut-off valves, that can be actuated by the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in such a way that in each case one or more of the fixed restrictors is activated and opened, which define a high-pressure range which is suitable for the required cooling performance with an approximately optimum performance figure. As shown, a switchable valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a single inlet with multiple outlets each connected to an inlet of one of the restrictors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> such that the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines to which of the valve outlets the flow through the valve will be directed. Of course, the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> could be three individual valves each associated with one of the restrictors similar to the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the present invention has been described in what is considered to represent its preferred embodiment. However, it should be noted that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described without departing from its spirit or scope. </paragraph>
