<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for semiconductor processing and more specifically, to an improved substrate cleaning apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As used herein, semiconductor substrate processing includes but is not limited to the processing of carriers, sliders, wafers, disk heads, disks, squares, rounds, reticles and flat panel displays. At one or more stages of processing a semiconductor substrate, as indicated above, it is often necessary to clean the substrate, and various machines for cleaning substrates are known in which the substrates are cleaned by ultrasonic, megasonic or gigasonic energy, low, medium or high pressure water at various temperatures, brushes, either fixed or rotating, or other means. Further, the substrate is supported in either a vertical or horizontal orientation during the cleaning process. The cleaning process may be implemented while the substrate is either at a fixed position or moving with respect to one or more cleaning devices. If at a fixed position, the substrate is either stationary or rotating, and cleaning devices, for example; brushes, are most often rotating although nonrotating brushes may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Of particular importance in maintaining the integrity of the cleaning process is providing a desired pressure or force between the brush and the substrate during the cleaning process. If there is too little brush pressure or force, an inferior cleaning action is produced; and the quality of the cleaning process is poor. However, with too great a brush force on the substrate, the brush medium, for example, bristles, may bend or deflect to such an extent that the brush action is less effective or can cause substrate damage, thereby providing a lower quality cleaning process. In other situations, the brush medium may be deflected into the core of the brush and release contaminants onto the substrate. That action is obviously counterproductive to a high quality substrate cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a consistent substrate cleaning process, several devices are known for providing a proper brush force. With one device, a drive, for example, a pneumatic cylinder, moves a brush assembly downward into contact with the substrate until the brush assembly contacts a positive stop. Thus, with the brush assembly at a known and repeatable position with each substrate, a consistent brush force is applied to each substrate. This device does not provide a particularly constant brush force and is not sensitive to changing conditions that affect brush force, such as brush wear, substrate thickness, brush medium diameter differences, stop wear, or brush core diameters. Further, such a device is difficult to accurately readjust with different size brushes and substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With another device a rotating, horizontally oriented brush is mounted on a vertical slide. A counterweight is used to balance the brush assembly at a desired height such that the brush is immediately above or just touching the substrate. A cylinder is then used to move the brush assembly downward, and air pressure in the cylinder is used to provide a desired brush force onto the substrate. A device of this nature is very complex and is very difficult to maintain in a calibrated balanced condition. Further, the device is also difficult to adjust to accommodate different size substrates and different brushes. Further, this other device requires a relatively large number of components to implement and thus, is very expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are other cleaning devices in which the brush is moved through precise increments of motion and into contact with the substrate against the action of a mechanical spring. The force of the brush against the substrate is a function of the extent to which the spring is compressed. While this system is simpler than some other systems, it is also difficult to adjust for different size substrates and is also subject to inconsistencies caused by variations in the spring constant of the spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another system, a substrate is supported vertically and a brush extending over a diameter of the substrate is suspended at its upper end from one end of a horizontally extending drive arm. The opposite end of the drive arm is connected to a cylinder which reciprocates the drive arm and the brush in a horizontal direction into and out of contact with the wafer. A force transducer is located at the opposite end of the drive arm and is used to control the force that the cylinder applies to the opposite end of the drive arm, thereby controlling the force that the brush applies to the substrate. This system has an advantage over prior systems in that a force used to move the brush into contact with the substrate is measured and fed back to a control, thereby providing a real time control over the force applied by the cylinder during the cleaning process. Thus, the system has the advantage of being able to provide a more consistent force during the cleaning process than the prior systems. Further, the desired or target brush cleaning force is more easily changed to accommodate different size substrates and brushes than was possible with other systems described above. However, such a system has several disadvantages. First, while the force being measured is directly related to the force being applied to the substrate, it is not a measure of the force being experienced by the substrate. The substrate is vertically suspended as are the brushes and both are subject to some deflection over their length as is the drive arm. Thus, the force on the substrate is subject to some variation over that measured at the opposite end of the drive arm. Further, the device has a further complexity in that the motion of both the substrate and the brushes must be precisely controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for an improved substrate cleaning machine that has the ability to precisely control the force being applied by a cleaning brush and also be of a reliable and cost efficient design. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a substrate cleaning apparatus having a more efficient and reliable cleaning process. The cleaning apparatus of the present invention further provides a more consistent, reliable and higher quality substrate cleaning process that has a relatively simple and inexpensive structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention and the described embodiments, the substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention includes a vertically extending spindle having a substrate supported on its upper end. A brush extends generally horizontally over the substrate, and a force measuring gage is mounted to the spindle for detecting forces applied to the substrate. A spindle control is electrically connected to the force measuring gage and mechanically coupled to the spindle and causes the spindle to move as a function of the forces being applied to the substrate by the brush. The substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention has the advantage of providing the user with a relatively simple and less expensive apparatus that provides a consistent high quality substrate cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention includes a method of cleaning a substrate supported on an upper end of a spindle by first positioning a brush at a fixed elevation over the substrate. Next, the spindle is moved upward to bring the substrate into contact with the brush. Thereafter, a cleaning force on the substrate caused by the brush is measured, and the spindle is moved in response to the measured cleaning force on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the substrate is first moved into contact with the brush; and thereafter, the substrate is moved upward through an incremental displacement into a cleaning contact with the brush. In another aspect of the invention, a user provides a cleaning force value and a tolerance bandwidth around that value, thereby defining a range of acceptable cleaning forces the spindle is moved to maintain the cleaning force on the substrate within the range of acceptable cleaning forces. In a still further aspect of the invention, an acceptable cleaning force value is provided, the spindle is moved to maintain the cleaning force on the substrate substantially equal to the cleaning force value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Various additional advantages, objects and features of the invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> substrate cleaning system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a substrate cleaning station <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having an enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a generally cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is rigidly connected to an enclosure bottom <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be capped with a removable top or cover (not shown). Centrally located within the enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> rigidly connected to a bottom wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a spindle tube <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rigidly connected to an upper wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted within the spindle tube <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, for example, by bearings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, for example, a vacuum chuck, is mounted to the upper, distal end <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is oriented generally vertically with respect to the enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and extends through a center hole <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the enclosure bottom <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that the axis of rotation of the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is substantially colinear with the centerline of the cylindrical side wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is secured to the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> upon the chuck being activated in a known manner. The lower, proximal end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to one side of a flexible coupling <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The opposite side of a flexible coupling <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to an output shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the spindle rotation motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected, for example, by fasteners <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, to a slide <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, for example, a ball nut. The slide <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted with respect to a drive screw <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, for example, a ball screw. The ball screw is rotatably mounted at its upper end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to an enclosure support plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The lower end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the ball screw <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to a drive pully <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that, in turn, is connected via a toothed belt <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to an output shaft of a spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, for example, a stepping motor, located behind the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is comprised of a generally vertical brush support assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> having a brush arm assembly <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extending generally radially from the upper distal end of the support assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The arm assembly <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes a drive shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted by bearings <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> within a generally cylindrical brush arm <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The outer distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected to one end of a brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> having a cleaning medium <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, for example, bristles, PVA, mohair, etc., for cleaning the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and medium <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are partially enclosed by a cover or shield <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The proximal end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to a pulley <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A drive belt <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is mounted at one end around the pulley <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, extends through the interior of the brush support <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and is mounted at its lower end around drive pulley <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Drive pulley <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is connected to an output shaft <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of a brush rotation motor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Thus, energizing the brush rotation motor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> causes the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The brush support assembly <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes a generally cylindrical hollow support tube <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that extends through an opening <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> within the bottom <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The support arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted within a bushing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> made of a low friction material, for example, a &ldquo;TEFLON&rdquo; material. The TEFLON bushing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is mounted within a bushing collar <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is rigidly secured to the bottom <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for example, by fasteners <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The support arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further has a drive collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rigidly connected thereto, for example, by welding or being integral therewith. The drive collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is mounted on a gasket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that is made from a low friction material, for example, a &ldquo;TEFLON&rdquo; material. The collar <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further includes a drive arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is rotatably mounted to a distal end of a rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extending from a brush pivot motor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, for example, a fluid powered cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is rigidly mounted to the enclosure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by means of a bracket <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Extension of the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> moves the drive arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the entire brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through an angular displacement, for example, a clockwise angular displacement (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Similarly, upon the cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> retracting the rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is angularly rotated in the opposite direction, for example, a counterclockwise direction. Therefore, for example, when the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is fully retracted, the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located in a default, rest position in which the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, medium <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> are out of contact with the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as shown by the solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Thus, the brush arm assembly <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is at a location or position that does not interfere with the loading or unloading of the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> onto or from the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. However, when the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is fully extended, the brush assembly is rotated to an operating or cleaning position in which the brush arm <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is normally oriented generally diametrically across the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, the mechanical interface between the medium <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is very critical to achieving the highest quality cleaning process. Therefore, it is desirable that the force or pressure imposed by the medium <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> onto the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> be controllable and accurately maintained during the cleaning process. To obtain the desired force control, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A, a strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to the motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> includes a strain gage transducer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> mechanically coupled to, for example, in contact with, a floating plate <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The floating plate <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is free to move or slide vertically with respect to the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A thrust bearing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is in mechanical communication, for example, in contact with, an upper surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the floating plate <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The thrust bearing has a thrust washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> on its upper side and a snap ring <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is mounted within a groove (not shown) of the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, any force, whether from gravity or externally applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> onto the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, is transferred through the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and into the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. That force is then transferred from the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the strain gage transducer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by the snap ring <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the thrust washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the thrust bearing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the floating plate <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the spindle rotation motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the brush rotation motor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the brush pivot motor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives an input on signal line <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> from the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and is operative to control the operation of the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> such that a desired force is constantly maintained on the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, before the strain gage can be used to provide force measurements, the strain gage measuring system must be initially calibrated. In other words, the control must determine an existing preload on the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is, forces detected by the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that are not caused by contact between the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this process, the output signal from the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is sampled by the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> then produces a force reading or value representing the spindle preload force. A force reading or value from samples of the output signal of the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is determined by using known processes, for example, a force reading may consist of an average of sixty samples of the output signal of the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> taken over 1 second. The calibration process permits the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to discriminate the forces applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from preexisting forces on the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Often the calibration process is done as part of a machine setup procedure but alternatively, may be done at some other point in the cycle of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In use, as part of the substrate or semiconductor wafer processing, a wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is loaded by known robotic means onto the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. During that loading process, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is retracted within the cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located at its default or rest position. The rest position is a position within the enclosure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> where the brush does not interfere with the loading, unloading of the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Further, at this time, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has provided a command signal to turn on the brush rotation motor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to rotate at a desired angular velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a substrate cleaning cycle is executed having the process steps generally illustrated in the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. First, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines at <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, that the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is at its rest position and that the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is rotating. If either of those conditions is not met, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> activates at <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, an error indicator, for example, an LED or screen display, identifying which of the conditions is not met. If the brush is at the rest position and rotating, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> then determines at <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, whether the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is loaded onto the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. If, for example, the chuck is a vacuum chuck, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> checks whether the vacuum solenoid feeding the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has been activated. Alternatively, although not shown, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can, in a known manner, monitor a pressure transducer in a pressure measuring relationship with the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to determine that the wafer is loaded. If the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines that the wafer is not properly loaded onto the chuck <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, it sets at <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, an error indicator representing the detected error condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is properly loaded, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> then at <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> provides a command signal to turn on the spindle rotation motor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to rotate at a desired angular velocity. Next, at <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, the control starts an internal cleaning cycle timer. Thereafter, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, provides a command signal to activate the brush pivot motor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated example, control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes fluid to be ported into the cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, extending the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> therefrom, thereby pivoting the arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the brush cleaning position illustrated in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Normally, in the cleaning position, the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is located diametrically across the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Further, cleaning fluids are dispensed either through the brush or externally onto the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in a known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, at <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> executes a subroutine to move the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in a vertically upward direction into contact with the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. There are many different processes that may be implemented in moving the wafer into contact with the brush, and several of those processes will be described. As part of each of the processes, a check is made for the expiration of the cleaning cycle timer. Upon detecting the expiration of the cleaning cycle timer, the control <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, at A<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, provides a command signal to the motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to lower the spindle <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby moving the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> away from and out of contact with the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Normally, the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will be lowered to the vertical positions at which they started the cycle at step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. Next the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, provides a command signal that operates the brush pivot cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to retract the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, thereby pivoting the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> back to its default, rest position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A first method for moving the wafer into contact with the brush is a two-step process in which the wafer is first moved to a desired elevation at which it initially contacts the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is moved a fixed increment in the vertically upward direction into the brush. That two-step process is implemented using the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. At <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> first reads a previously stored contact force setpoint value. The contact force setpoint is the minimum value of force between the wafer and the brush that is detectable by the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. That contact force value can be determined by any number of methods and is normally determined in a preprocessing calibration cycle. Once that contact force value is determined, it is stored within the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and is read at <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> as a contact force setpoint or reference value CNF<highlight><subscript>SP</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, provides a command signal to start the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotating in a direction that causes the ball nut <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to move upward toward the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the control at <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is monitoring or sampling the output signal from the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and at <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, determines whether the force being applied by the rotating brush against the spindle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is equal to the force reference or setpoint value. In the illustrated method, the force being applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is equal to the gross force measured by the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> less the previously determined preload force. That difference is then compared to the contact force setpoint. Upon detecting an equality, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> then provides a command signal at <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, to turn the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After achieving the brush contact position, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, operates the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to raise the wafer a predetermined fixed distance. In some applications, once the contact position is accurately determined, the brush force may be adequately controlled by simply incrementing the wafer into the brush over a fixed distance. The applicability of this method to a particular cleaning process will depend on the application variables. The brush stays in contact with the wafer until the cleaning cycle timer expires as detected by the controller <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the controller causes the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to be lowered out of contact with the brush, at <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; and thereafter, the brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is pivoted back to its original position, at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. a second method for moving the wafer into contact with the brush is to maintain the force between the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> within a force range. The controller <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> reads a cleaning force setpoint from memory. The cleaning force setpoint may be determined by any one of several methods including a preprocessing experimental cleaning cycle in which wafers are cleaned at different forces. By observing and testing the cleaned wafers, a desired cleaning force is thus determined and input to the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as a cleaning force setpoint CLF<highlight><subscript>SP </subscript></highlight>utilizing known input devices. Next, at <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the controller calculates a force range in accordance with a tolerance that is entered into the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by the user. If the tolerance is, for example, 10%, the cleaning force bandwidth or range, CLF<highlight><subscript>BW</subscript></highlight>, would have a lower limit of 0.9&times;CLF<highlight><subscript>SP </subscript></highlight>and an upper limit of <highlight><bold>1.1&times;CLF</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>SP</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> After determining the range of acceptable forces between the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, proceeds to sample force measurements of the strain gage in a manner as previously described. Thereafter, the control, at <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, determines whether the measured force is above, within or below the acceptable force range or bandwidth. If the force reading is above the acceptable range, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, then checks whether the cleaning cycle timer has expired. If it has not, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, then provides a command signal to start the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotating in a direction causes the ball nut <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to move downward away from the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The downward motion is a fixed incremental displacement determined by the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> counting a fixed number of pulses to the stepping motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> then, at <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, again samples a strain gage and, at <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, determines whether the force measurement is above, within or below the bandwidth. If the force reading is within the cleaning force bandwidth, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, checks the state of the cleaning cycle timer; and if it has not expired, again samples the strain gage at <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. If at <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines the force measurement is below the cleaning force range, at <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> provides command signal to start the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotating in a direction that causes the ball nut <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, motor mount <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and spindle assembly to move upward toward the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The upward motion is again a fixed incremental motion that is normally determined by the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> counting a number of pulses to the stepping motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, at <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>, the control again checks the state of the cleaning cycle timer and the above process continues for the duration of the cleaning cycle. The above process is effective to maintain a cleaning force within a predetermined tolerance of the cleaning force setpoint as determined by the user. Upon the cleaning cycle timer expiring, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to be lowered as provided at <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; and thereafter, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes the brush to pivot back to its rest position as provided at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> third method for moving the wafer into contact with the brush is to maintain the force between the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> at a cleaning force setpoint value. The control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> reads a cleaning force setpoint from memory. Thereafter, the control at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, samples the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and at <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, determines whether the forces being applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> onto the substrate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are equal to the cleaning force setpoint. The cleaning forces exerted by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be determined by subtracting the contact force setpoint from the gross force measured by the strain gage <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> If the brush force is equal to the cleaning force setpoint, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, stops the operation of the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. If the force being applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> does not equal the cleaning force setpoint, the control at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, detects whether the brush force is less than the cleaning force setpoint. If so, at <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> provides command signals to the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to move the wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> closer to the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In the current example, the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is operated to raise the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. If the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> detects that the applied force of the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is greater than the cleaning force setpoint value, the spindle elevation motor is operated by the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, to move the wafer away from the rotating brush. In the current example, the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is operated to move the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After operating the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> as described above, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, then checks whether the cleaning cycle timer has expired. If not, the subroutine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> causes the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to iterate the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, beginning with the sampling of the force signal at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. By repeating the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes the elevation of the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and wafer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to be continuously adjusted, so that the cleaning force applied by the rotating brush <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> remains substantially constant and equal to the cleaning force setpoint. When the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> determines at <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, that the cleaning cycle timer has expired, the subroutine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> ends. Thereafter, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> first, at <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, provides a command signal that operates the motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to lower the spindle assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and substrate; and thereafter, the control <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, at <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, provides a command causing the brush pivot cylinder <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to retract the cylinder rod <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby pivoting the brush assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> back to its default, rest position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Thus, the substrate cleaning apparatus of the present invention has the advantage of providing the user with a relatively simple and less expensive apparatus that provides a consistent high quality substrate cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in considerable detail in order to describe the best mode of practicing the invention, it is not the intention of Applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, while the spindle elevation motor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is described as a stepping motor, as will be appreciated, other motors or drive systems may be used to move the spindle assembly and substrate. Further, while the described embodiment utilizes a strain gage to detect the brush cleaning forces, other devices and methods of accurately detecting brush cleaning forces may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the invention in its broadest aspects is not limited to the specific detail shown and described. Consequently, departures may be made from the details described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims which follow. </paragraph>
