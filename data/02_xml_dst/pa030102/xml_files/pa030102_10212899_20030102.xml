<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Field of the Invention: The invention relates to a semiconductor wafer mode controlling assembly and, more particularly, to such an assembly in which modes of circuitry of dice (ICs) on the wafer are controlled through alternating signals applied to the dice through probe pads on the wafers. The invention also includes methods for constructing and operating such wafers and the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> State of the Art: Typically, finished integrated circuit chip assemblies include a die or dice attached to a lead frame and encapsuled with an encapsulant. Numerous expensive and time consuming steps are involved in producing such chip assemblies. These steps may include the following: (1) forming dice on a wafer substrate, (2) testing the dice, (3) cutting dice from the wafer, (4) connecting a die or dice to a lead frame, (5) encapsulating the die or dice, lead frame, connecting wires, and any auxiliary circuitry, (6) performing burn-in and providing other stresses to the dice, and (7) testing the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Defects in a finished chip assembly can prevent it from operating as intended. In spite of painstaking attention to detail, defects may be introduced at various levels of production. For example, manufacturing defects in the die may cause a failure. It has been found, however, that some defects are manifest immediately, while other defects are manifest only after the die has been operated for some period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Reliability curves are used to express a hazard rate or instantaneous failure rate h(t) over time t, and often have a &ldquo;bath tub&rdquo; shape. The reliability curves for many, if not all, ICs are generally like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The reliability curve in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be divided into three regions: (1) an infant mortality region, (2) a random failures region, and (3) a wearout region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The infant mortality region begins at time to, which occurs upon completion of the manufacturing process and initial electrical test. Some ICs, of course, fail the initial electrical test. Inherent manufacturing defects are generally expected in a small percentage of ICs, even though the ICs are functional at time to. Because of these inherent manufacturing defects (that may be caused by contamination and/or process variability), these ICs have shorter lifetimes than the remaining population. Typically known as ICs suffering &ldquo;infant mortalities,&rdquo; while the ICs may constitute a small fraction of the total population, they are the largest contributor to early-life failure rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Once ICs subject to infant mortality failure rates have been removed from the IC population, the remaining ICs have a very low and stable field failure rate. The relatively flat, bottom portion of the bathtub curve, referred to as the random failure region, represents stable field-failure rates which occur after the IC failures due to infant mortalities have been removed and before IC wearout occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Eventually, as wearout occurs, the failure rate of the ICs begins to increase rapidly. However, the average lifetime of an IC is not clearly understood, because most lab tests simulate only a few years of normal IC operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Burn-in&rdquo; refers to the process of accelerating failures that occur during the infant mortality phase of component life in order to remove the inherently weaker ICs. The process has been regarded as critical for product reliability since the semiconductor industry began. There have been two basic types of burn-in. During the process known as &ldquo;static&rdquo; burn-in, temperatures are increased (or sometimes decreased) while only some of the pins on a test IC are biased. No data is written to the IC, nor is the IC exercised under stress during static burn-in. During &ldquo;un-monitored dynamic&rdquo; burn-in, temperatures are increased while the pins on the test IC are biased. The IC is cycled under stress, and data patterns are written to the IC but not read. Hence, there is no way of knowing whether the data written is retained by the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In recent years, as memory systems have grown in complexity, the need for more and more reliable components has escalated. This need has been met in two ways. First, manufacturing process technology has reached a level of maturity and stability where inherent manufacturing defects, caused by contamination and process variation, have been reduced. As a result, latent failures have been significantly reduced, resulting in lower field failure rates. Secondly, more sophisticated methods of screening infant mortalities have been developed. As IC manufacturing practices have become more consistent, it has become clear that burn-in systems that simply provide stress stimuli in the form of high temperature and VCC (power) to the IC under test may be inadequate in two areas: (1) such burn-in systems cannot detect and screen infant mortality failure rates measured in small fractions of a percent; (2) such burn-in systems are unable to confirm random failure rates that are claimed to be significantly lower than 100 FITs (i.e., fewer than 100 failures per billion IC hours) at normal system operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To address these issues, an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; burn-in approach can be utilized. The term &ldquo;intelligent burn-in,&rdquo; as used in this discussion, refers to the ability to combine functional, programmable testing with the traditional burn-in cycling of the IC under test in the same chamber. Advantages to this approach include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (1) The ability to identify when a failure occurs and, thereby, compute infant mortality rates as a function of burn-in time. As a result, an optimal burn-in time for each product family can be established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (2) The ability to correlate burn-in failure rates with life test data typically obtained by IC manufacturers to determine the field failure rates of their products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (3) The ability to incorporate into the burn-in process certain tests traditionally performed using automatic test equipment (ATE) systems, thereby reducing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Some ICs have internal test modes not accessible during normal operation. These test modes may be invoked on ATE by applying a high voltage to a single pin. The IC is then addressed in a manner so as to specify the operating mode of interest. Operating modes such as data compression, grounded substrate, and cell plate biasing can be enabled, thus allowing evaluation of IC sensitivities and help in isolating possible failure mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The electrical characterization data gathered from these tests is used to identify which part of the circuit appears to be malfunctioning, the possible location(s) on the IC, and the probable type or nature of the defect. To facilitate discussion and reporting, failures are often classified according to their electrical characteristics, referred to as the failure mode. Typical classification of these modes includes the following: single cell defect, adjacent cell defect, row failure, column failure, address failure, open pin, supply leakage, pin leakage, standby current leakage, and entire array failure (all dead cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In anticipation that some ICs will have defects, many ICs are designed with redundancies. In such ICs, a defective section of the IC may be shut off and a redundant but properly operating section activated and used in place of the defective section. For example, typical integrated memory circuits include arrays of memory cells arranged in rows and columns. In many such integrated memory arrays, several redundant rows and columns are provided to be used as substitutes for defective rows or columns of memory. When a defective row or column is identified, rather than treating the entire array as defective, a redundant row or column is substituted for the defective row or column. This substitution is performed by assigning the address of the defective row or column to the redundant row or column such that, when an address signal corresponding to the defective row or column is received, the redundant row or column is addressed instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To make substitution of the redundant row or column substantially transparent to a system employing the memory circuit, the memory circuit may include an address detection circuit. The address detection circuit monitors the row and column addresses and, when the address of a defective row or column is received, enables the redundant row or column instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One type of address detection circuit is a fuse-bank address detection circuit. Fuse-bank address detection circuits employ a bank of sense lines where each sense line corresponds to a bit of an address. The sense lines are programmed by blowing fuses in the sense lines in a pattern corresponding to the address of the defective row or column. Addresses are then detected by first applying a test voltage across the bank of sense lines. Then, bits of the address are applied to the sense lines. If the pattern of blown fuses corresponds exactly to the pattern of address bits, the sense lines all block current and the voltage across the bank remains high. Otherwise, at least one sense line conducts and the voltage falls. A high voltage thus indicates the programmed address has been detected. A low voltage indicates a different address has been applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Antifuses have been used in place of conventional fuses. Antifuses are capacitive-type structures that, in their unblown states, form open circuits. Antifuses may be &ldquo;blown&rdquo; by applying a high voltage across the antifuse. The high voltage causes the capacitive-type structure to break down, forming a conductive path through the antifuse. Various flash devices may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Typically, ICs have numerous contacts that provide interfaces between the circuits within the die and the outside world. The contacts are used for bond pads to which bond wires are connected. The bond wires are also connected to the lead frame. The contacts (bond pads) may be used for various signals including those for addressing, data (DQ), VCC (power), VSS (ground), and control. However, physically, the contacts are extremely small or tiny. As such, it is impractical and expensive to provide direct connections between each of the contacts and probes used in, for example, testing, stressing, or repairing the IC. Probe pads that are much larger than die contacts have been placed on, for example, the edge of the wafer. However, the sheer volume of contacts limits the number of contacts to which probe pads may be practically connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If there is a defect in an IC, it is desirable to discover the defect as early as possible in the manufacturing process for a finished chip assembly. In that case, if it is determined that the defect cannot be repaired, the time and expense of completing a chip assembly will not be expended. Further, some repairs may be less expensive to repair at an earlier stage of production of the chip assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be desirable to test, stress, and, if necessary, attempt to repair ICs while they are still on a wafer, rather than in a packaged chip assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,369 to Dasse et al. describes an apparatus for performing wafer level testing of integrated circuit dice. Burn-in is described as being performed while the dice are still connected to the wafer. Conductors are connected between wafer contact pads and contacts (bonding pads) on dice. In a preferred embodiment, the conductors supply six voltage signals: power supply high voltage level signal, data signal, reset signal, clock signal, power supply memory programming voltage level signal, and ground voltage level signal. For the following reasons, connecting six conductors to each die has a considerable effect in terms of wafer real estate and/or processing steps. There are a large number of dice on the wafer. Current requirements dictate using numerous wafer contact pads and conductors to supply signals to the dice. Included extra conductors for redundancies increase the number by at least a factor of two. Further, the conductors are positioned on top of the dice and/or in the dicing lanes (streets or street area of the wafer). Placing all six conductors in the dicing lanes requires either stacking the conductors one on top of the other in a dicing lane, and/or widening the dicing lane (which may reduce the number of dice of the wafer). Placing several conductors over the dice requires additional processing steps. The processing steps may be further increased where conductors run both vertically and horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for an assembly in which a variety of signals may be supplied to dice in wafer form through a small number of contacts and conductive paths. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer having dice that include circuitry that is placed into a mode when the circuitry receives an alternating signal having certain characteristics. The alternating signal may be supplied from a system controller through a probe, probe pad, and conductive path on the wafer. In a preferred embodiment, the conductive path simultaneously carries a VCC power signal and the alternating signal to the circuitry. However, the alternating signal may be carried on a conductive path different from the one carrying the VCC signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A great deal of information may be conveyed through the alternating signal, making other signals unnecessary in controlling, testing, stressing, and repairing dice on the wafer. For example, clocking information may be conveyed through the alternating signal. The circuitry may be placed in different modes in response to different characteristics of the alternating signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The alternating signal and a VCC power signal are received through a single contact on each die. There may be redundant contacts, conductive paths, and probe pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The dice may include additional circuitry that produces a signal indicating a particular event (e.g., a test is completed) has occurred. A fuse may be blown at the occurrence of the event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor wafer mode controlling system includes a system controller to control application of the alternating signals and other signals to the dice on the wafer. The semiconductor wafer mode controlling system may also control a probe positioning controller including an array of probes that selectively brings the probes into contact with the probe pads, whereby the alternating signal having the certain characteristics is transmitted from the probe to the circuitry through the probe pad and conductive path and the circuitry of each of the dice is placed into the mode. Each die on the wafer may be identical or there may be differences in the dice. Where there are differences, the system controller may supply alternating signals having different characteristics as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The circuitry in the dice includes a local oscillator. A local oscillator may be off the die and on the wafer or in the system controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the dice are cut from the wafers and packaged or otherwise used in commercial applications, the circuitry may continue to be enabled or may be disabled before a chip assembly containing one or more such dice is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A wafer according to the present invention may be used in connection with a wide variety of semiconductor devices including memories (e.g., DRAM or SRAM), microprocessors, control circuits, and ASICs. The wafer may be used in computer systems and in a wide variety of other electronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention includes a method of constructing wafers and wafer mode controlling systems that have the above described characteristics.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A. Wafer Overview </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto which numerous dice are formed through etching, deposition, or other well known techniques. Since there are many dice on a wafer, for clarity of illustration, only dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C (collectively &ldquo;dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (collectively &ldquo;probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) are formed on substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Because the size of dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is exaggerated with respect to the size of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the optimal placement of probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not shown. However, probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> should be positioned such that the total number of dice on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is either not reduced at all or reduced only by a minimum due to the presence of probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Such placement may be along the edge of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where there is unused space caused by the round shape of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the non-round shape of the dice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Conductive paths, which may be conductive traces, are connected between probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and contacts on dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, a conductive path <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which includes branches <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B, is positioned between probe pad <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a first contact on dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C. A conductive path <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which includes branches <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B, is positioned between probe pad <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a second contact on dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C. A conductive path <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which includes branches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B, is positioned between probe pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a third contact on dice <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, a conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected between probe pad <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and particular contacts on a first contact of dice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. A conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected between probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a second contact of dice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. A conductive path <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is connected between probe pad <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a third contact on dice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The conductive paths may run between dice in dicing lanes or &ldquo;streets&rdquo;, or run over dice. (A conductive path may also run in a street and over a dice.) For example, conductive paths <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> run along a street <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> between dice <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C and dice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. As an example of different possibilities, conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> runs over dice <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C. An insulating coating, such as a borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) glass coating, may separate a die from a conductive path. Further, to keep the streets narrow, conductive paths may be stacked on top of each other. A via or other connection may be made from a conductive path through the coating to a contact on die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. Coatings may also be useful to the extent conductive paths overlap. An advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that the number of conductive paths is reduced, thereby reducing processing steps in insulating conductive paths from each other and other components on the wafer and, if necessary, in removing insulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, probe pads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected to two sets of dice (i.e., <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C). Probe pads <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, however, are connected to only one set of dice (i.e., <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C). This difference illustrates that the invention is not limited to a particular number of dice being connected to a probe. In practice, the controlling software may be simpler if each probe pad is connected to the same number of dice, but that is not required. Further, the controlling software will be simpler if each die on a wafer is identical. However, the invention is not limited to the dice on a wafer being identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, conductive paths are shown running in only horizontal directions. However, the conductive paths may run in both horizontal and vertical directions, although doing so may add additional processing steps. The conductive paths may run in only the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is an alternative embodiment, which is the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> except that all the dice on the wafer are connected to a single probe pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through conductor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected to conductors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>C, etc. Probe pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be connected to VSS. As still another alternative embodiment, substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be connected to VSS, eliminating another probe pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> B. Die Circuitry and Alternating Signal Examples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> provides an example of circuitry in die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is schematic in that the components are not necessarily to scale or in the only relative position. Various other circuitry may also be employed in addition to or in place of the circuitry illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> connects probe pad <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (near an edge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) to a contact or bond pad <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A on die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. In ordinary operation of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A carry a VCC signal to internal circuitry of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. To control modes of the circuitry of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, an alternating signal may be applied simultaneously with the VCC signal to conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A. The alternating signal may be a continuous or discontinuous digital signal, a continuous or discontinuous analog signal, or some combination of them. The alternating signal may employ a modulation scheme, such as frequency modulation (FM), amplitude modulation (AM), phase shift keying modulation (PSK), pulse width modulation (PWM), quadrature phase shift keying modulation (QPSK), and others. The alternating signal may be applied to a contact other than the VCC contact. It is not necessary that the alternating signal be applied to a conductive path that also carries another signal; however, doing so may reduce the number of conductive paths, probe pads, and probes required. A contact <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>A may provide a VSS signal between die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and probe pad <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Various examples of alternating signals are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, an alternating signal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is superimposed on a VCC signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. As used herein, &ldquo;superimposed&rdquo; means there is a voltage overlap between alternating signal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and VCC signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Digital circuitry often includes input buffers (such as input buffer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that, for example, block signals between voltages V<highlight><subscript>IL </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>IH</subscript></highlight>. In such a case, it is desirable for the alternating signal to be above or below the range of V<highlight><subscript>IL </subscript></highlight>to V<highlight><subscript>IH </subscript></highlight>so that the alternating signal will be invisible to the buffers. Digital circuitry may also include isolation circuitry (such as low electrostatic discharge (ESD) latching circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that blocks very high voltages, e.g., 13 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> To illustrate some possibilities, from time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, alternating signal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is a square wave signal having a frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. From time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, alternating signal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is greater than f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In practice, the number of cycles at a particular frequency may be more or less than is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. From time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, alternating signal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> employs a frequency modulation scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows an alternating signal <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at voltages greater than V<highlight><subscript>IH </subscript></highlight>and a sinusoidal alternating signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at voltages less than V<highlight><subscript>IL</subscript></highlight>. Of course, the present invention is not limited to dice that include circuitry that blocks signals between V<highlight><subscript>IH </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>IL</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Types of alternating signals include control alternating signals and data alternating signals. A control alternating signal conveys control information to circuitry. A clock signal may be an example of a control alternating signal. A data alternating signal conveys data to be written into storage or operated upon. For example, a microprocessor may operate on a data that is written into a register by adding it to data written in another register. Some alternating signals include both a control alternating signal and a data alternating signal, because they contain both control and data information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, signals passing through input buffer <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are applied to a VCC power bus <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. VCC power bus <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> carries both the VCC signal and the alternating signal(s). Except for those circuits designed to pass the alternating signals, circuits connected to VCC power bus <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> block the alternating signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In operation, demodulator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> determines one or more characteristics of the alternating signal. Information is conveyed through the alternating signal to die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A by the characteristics. The alternating signals may have various characteristics including, but not limited to, peak-to-peak amplitudes, average amplitudes, frequency, change in frequency, duration or number of cycles at a particular frequency or voltage, and relationship between average or peak-to-peak voltage and VCC or zero volts or ground. Data may be transmitted through high and low voltages within the peaks of a square wave. It is noted that the alternating signal does not have to be periodic, or if it is periodic, it does not have to be over a large number of cycles. The characteristics of the alternating signal may change with time (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) to add further information to control die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A great deal of information may be provided into an alternating signal. For example, upon demodulation, an alternating signal may provide circuitry with control information and clocking information, as well as pass data to be written into memory or operated on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Clock signals used in die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may be generated through at least the following means: (1) the clock signals are generated completely inside die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A with no control from signals outside die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A; (2) the clock signals are generated inside die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, but under at least some control from the alternating signal supplied from outside die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A; (3) clock information is encoded in the alternating signal and then extracted from the alternating signal by demodulator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>; or (4) the clock signal is generated completely outside die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and supplied to die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A through the alternating signal or some other signal. Depending on how it is implemented, means (2) may be an example of means (3). Use of the alternating signal in originating or controlling a clock signal(s) can help synchronize dice to each other and external circuitry. Clock signals may be used for timing tests and/or to provide general timing control and information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As an example of means (2), a clocking device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (which may be a local oscillator) may be controlled by a lock signal from demodulator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> based on clocking information from the alternating signal on conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and VCC power bus <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> By providing an oscillation signal through conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A, it is not necessary to use a dedicated contact and probe pad for the clock signal. Accordingly, one less probe pad is needed. Of course, another conductive path may be used to provide clock signals or information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Under some embodiments of the invention, a contact is used to provide data between a die and a probe pad. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> signal may pass from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A to probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and/or from probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A to die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. Contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may be, but is not required to be, a DQ contact. Contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may be a contact that is used only while die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A is on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or it may continue to be used in ordinary operation of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A after it is packaged. Examples of uses for contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A include the following. First, a signal from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may indicate information about the results of tests or other occurrences in die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A to off-wafer circuitry through probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As an example, a fuse or antifuse may be activated upon completion of a test allowing a particular signal to pass through contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A to probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The fuse may be blown in response to completion of a test or other event, the occurrence of which may be read then or later. The signal to activate the fuse or antifuse may come from contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A, or some other contact. A signal through contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may be as simple as a single bit (e.g., indicating a test was positive), or more extensive or complicated to provide diagnostic information. The signal from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may be a stream of data providing, for example, data read from array <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or some other component in die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. There may be more than one contact, such as contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A, used to transmit or receive data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A potential problem in providing output signals to a probe pad from multiple dice is contention on the conductive path to the probe pad. One possible solution is to have a different conductive path for each die output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A second solution is to have only one output conductive path shared by several dice, and to design the dice to not provide output signals to the probe pad until being instructed to do so by the alternating signal on conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The system controller (which may be off wafer as described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) may instruct each die in order (e.g., first die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, then die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B, then die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C, etc.) to respond to a particular test. If a die had not responded after a certain period of time, the system controller may assume the die was defective in some regard and instruct the next die to respond through its contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, one way in which dice may be instructed in order by the alternating signal is to place buffers <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>C etc. on conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Just prior to the time at which the dice are to respond, the alternating signal may instruct each die to place its respective buffer in high impedance mode. For example, die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may place buffer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>A in high impedance mode by sending a signal through conductor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A. Die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B may place buffer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>B in high impedance mode by sending a signal through conductor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B, etc. Then, upon sending a signal through contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A to conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may take buffer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>A out of high impedance mode by sending a signal through conductor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A. The alternating signal may then instruct die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B to send a signal through contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B to conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Buffers <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>C may have circuitry to respond to an override by the alternating signal. Such an override may be used if the system controller has not receive a signal on conductor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> after a certain amount of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Another way in which the dice may respond in order would be for each die to have its own identification code. A particular die would respond when a code on the alternating signal matched the identification code on the die. The codes may be placed on the dice through a photo process or through the alternating signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A third solution is to place buffers along conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which are enabled by, for example, a signal on conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, a</cross-reference> buffer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B may be enabled by a signal from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A or some other contact on die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, allowing the signal from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B to pass through buffer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B to probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then the signal from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>B (or from some other contact on die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B) may enable buffer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>C. Depending on the design, a buffer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A (not shown) between contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A and probe pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> would not be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, there are three probe pads connected to each die. There may be a greater or lesser number of probes connected to each die. There are numerous combinations of contacts on the dice to which the probe pads may be connected through conductive paths. The following are some of the possibilities:

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> C. System Level Examples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of a wafer mode controlling system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supported by a support <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, which may be part of a vacuum handler. A probe positioning controller <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> includes an array of probes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (including probes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>B, . . . <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>N) held by a probe support <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Probe positioning controller <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> may lower or raise probes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> as a group. Alternatively, individual ones of probes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be lowered or raised by, for example, solenoids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A system controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> controls probe positioning controller <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> through a conductor(s) <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. System controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> also sends signals to and perhaps receives signals from one or more of probes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> through conductors <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Logic <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> (which may include one or more microprocessors and dedicated hardware) provides signals to and may receive signals from conductors <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. A signal generator <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> may be used to create signals. Alternatively, logic <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> may generate all signals needed. In a preferred embodiment, the alternating signals that are conducted over conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> originate in system controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Signals may also be generated from circuitry on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Memory <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> may be used to store data used by logic <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and perhaps signal generator <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. System controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may include both digital and analog circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be housed in a heating chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (such as a burn-in oven), which may be an autoclave. Heat may be generated by heat strips placed on, for example, support <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, an embodiment of the invention includes heating chamber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which accommodates more than one wafer (e.g., wafers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D) at a time, which may be simultaneously tested by or otherwise controlled by system controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. (The wafers may be stacked, one above the other.) One or more probe positioning controllers (which may be like controller <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>) may be used in heating chamber <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Whether or not a heating chamber is used, more than one wafer may be simultaneously controlled by system controller <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The relatively small number of probes needed to control the wafer reduces the space required in heating chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> D. Modes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may enter, modify, operate within, or exit certain modes based on the characteristics of the alternating signal obtained through demodulator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and associated circuitry. Data may be transmitted through the alternating signal in a mode. The following are examples of the various modes within which die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may enter, modify, operate within, or exit in response to reception of information from the alternating signal: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> 1. Testing Modes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In various testing modes, die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may perform self-tests to determine whether certain portions of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A perform according to specification. These tests may include functional and/or parametric tests. Merely as an example, test circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may write data to locations in an array <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and then read from the locations in array <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to determine if the data was properly stored. Errors may be identified through error block <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and logic block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Other components of die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A (such as periphery <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>) may be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Test patterns and addressing information may be provided on the alternating signal on, for example, conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. For example, a first portion of the alternating signal may specify a particular test to be performed. A second portion of the alternating signal may provide the data to be written and the addressing information. A third portion of the alternating signal may indicate the conclusion of the test mode, or initiate another event such as a self-repair mode. Alternatively, test patterns and other information can be stored in memory on die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, or in a chip on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, data may be passed from contact <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A through conductive path <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to probe pad <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Such data may indicate that a test was successful or a test was not successful, or other diagnostic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> 2. Stressing Modes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As noted above, certain defects in a die will only appear after the die has been operated over a period of time under various conditions. These conditions may be accelerated in a self-stressing mode. An alternating signal with certain characteristics may initiate and control self-stressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> 3. Repair Modes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In various self-repair modes, die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A may repair various components through, for example, activating redundant circuits. The self-repair modes, including back-end repair, may be activated by different alternating signals. An alternating signal on conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may indicate which fuse or anti-fuse should be activated. Because complicated tests may be done while the die is on the wafer, repairs may be done before stressing including burn-in, prior to the completion of stressing, or after stressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Time and resources are saved if a repair is made before burn-in or other stressing. Time and resources are also saved it is determined before burn-in or other stressing that a repair is not available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> E. Additional Examples, Explanations, and Variations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Various input circuits may be used in die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> first alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A includes a regulator <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a clock extractor <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows an alternating signal (or a portion of one) received at contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows the regulator output at a conductor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference> shows a clock output at a conductor <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> second alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A includes a standard input buffer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> in parallel with a data buffer <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The alternating signal is received on a contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A (which may act as a row address strobe signal (RAS) contact pad). As an example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the alternating signal includes signals in the low level range <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> or alternative low level range <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> at, for example, low or radio frequencies. The data input levels are invisible to standard input buffer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> if above V<highlight><subscript>IH </subscript></highlight>or below V<highlight><subscript>IL</subscript></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, an input signal <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> at contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A in unmodulated form within range <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is received at a contact. Input buffer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> passes VCC (or the RAS signal), and data buffer <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> passes the data-in signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> third alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is similar to circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, except that circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> includes a second contact <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> that receives a reference level signal (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). A standard buffer <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> passes VCC and a buffer <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> passes the data-in signal from the alternating signal. Using contact <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> to pass a reference signal allows more information to be held off chip, but at a cost of an extra probe pad and conductive path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> fourth alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in which the data from contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and data from contact <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is fed into a differential buffer <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> such that a reference voltage is not needed. Buffers <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> produce individual control and/or data streams, as does differential buffer <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> through summing the signals at contacts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the input signal to contacts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> may be modulated with amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulse modulation (PM), or any other acceptable format at, for example, low frequency or radio frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> fifth alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> receives the VCC and data-in signals at contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A. A standard buffer <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> passes VCC. A demodulator <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> includes a filter <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and a detector <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> that extract the data-in signal, which is passed through buffer <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. Detector <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> may be, for example, an FM/PM discriminator or an AM detector. The detector design will vary with the method of modulation selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> sixth alternative input circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> receives the VCC and data-in signal from contact <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and a reference local oscillator signal on a contact <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The VCC signal is passed by standard buffer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. A detector <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> provides the data-in signal to buffer <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> based on signals from filters <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Again, supply of the reference signal from off chip makes the detector design easier. However, a carrier frequency local oscillator may be on or off the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Note that there is not necessarily any significance in providing different reference numerals for contacts <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. For simplicity, the input circuits of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> do not necessarily include all well known circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> There are various data formats of the alternating signal. An exemplary format may include a header, data packet, addressing, or a parity bit. Supplying an external clock via an additional contact tends to greatly simplify the circuit design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be used in connection with supervoltage test means and miscellaneous programming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is expected that the greatest utility for the present invention will be for dice at the wafer stage. In most cases, it is expected that the alternating signal will not be applied to a die after it is packaged and used in ordinary operation. However, the alternating signal may be applied and the die placed in modes or data communicated to the die after the die has been packaged and used in ordinary operation. Alternatively, the circuitry that responds to the alternating signals may be disabled prior to shipping the die for commercial use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In any event, a chip assembly having a die constructed according to the present invention may be used in a computer system or other system. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates a computer system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that includes a computer chassis <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, a key board <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, and a display monitor <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. Computer chassis <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> includes various electronic components including at least one chip assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Chip assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> includes a die constructed according to the present invention (i.e., a chip assembly that includes a die having circuitry designed to receive an alternating signal). Once packaged, or otherwise prepared for commercial use, die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A would be part of such a chip assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates an electronic device <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> that includes various electronic components including a chip assembly <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> (which may be the same as chip assembly <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>). Chip assembly <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> includes a die constructed according to the present invention. Electronic device <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may be any electronic device that includes dice, including, without limitation, memory devices, printers, displays, keyboards, computers (such as computer system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>), oscilloscopes, medical diagnostic equipment, and automobile control systems, to name only a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed of a variety of materials including silicon and gallium-arsenide. Wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to any particular shape or size, although currently 6&Prime;and 8&Prime; diameter wafers are popular. The dice are not limited to any particular type of dice. For example, the dice may be formed of various materials including silicon and gallium-arsenide. The dice may be such as are used with any of various memory chips, microprocessors, or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Factors to consider in determining the number of probe pads include limits to the amount of current passing through a single pad, expense, space available for probe pads, and avoiding complexity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As used in the claims, the terms &ldquo;connect,&rdquo; &ldquo;connectable,&rdquo; or &ldquo;connected&rdquo; are not necessarily limited to a direct connection. For example, probe pad <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, although indirectly through conductive path <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Further, there may be intermediated electronic components along or in the conductive paths, for example, buffers or amplifiers. In such a case, probe pad <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> would still be connected to die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, although indirectly. However, as used herein, the word &ldquo;connected&rdquo; refers to an operational connection and not a mere indirect connection. For example, every portion of the wafer is directly or indirectly connected with every other portion, but not every portion is operationally connected to another portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The materials mentioned herein, such as probe pads, contacts, conductive paths, and portions of the die and system, may be constructed according to various well known techniques from various well known materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> There may be various standard, well known circuits on the wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, other than the dice. Also, there may be additional buffers or amplifiers on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> separate from the dice. Further, there may be reductant probe pads, conductive paths, and contacts under the design of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Having thus described in detail preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention defined by the appended claims is not to be limited by particular details set forth in the above description as many apparent variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. </paragraph>
