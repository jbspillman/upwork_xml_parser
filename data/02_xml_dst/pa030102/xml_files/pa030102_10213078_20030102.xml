<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of delivering two or more mutually-reactive reaction gases when a predetermined film is deposited on a substrate, and a shower head used in the gas delivery method, function to increase the film deposition rate while preventing formation of contaminating particles. In this method, one reaction gas is delivered toward the edge of the substrate, and the other reaction gases are delivered toward the central portion of the substrate, each of the reaction gases being delivered via an independent gas outlet to prevent the reaction gases from being mixed. In the shower head, separate passages are provided to prevent the first reaction gas from mixing with the other reaction gases by delivering the first reaction gas from outlets formed around the edge of the bottom surface of the shower head. The other reaction gases are delivered from outlets formed in the central portion of the bottom surface of the shower head. Accordingly, one of the mutually-reactive gases is delivered toward the central portion of the substrate, and the others are delivered toward the edge of the substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of delivering reaction gases during deposition of a predetermined layer onto a substrate with two or more mutually-reactive reaction gases, and a shower head used to introduce the reaction gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Physical vapor deposition (PVD, also referred to as &ldquo;sputtering&rdquo;), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and pulsed CVD (PCVD, the details of which will be described later) can be used to form a predetermined layer by depositing a vapor material on a substrate. When a predetermined layer is formed by conventional vapor deposition methods, source gases (reaction gas) are generally provided by a shower head installed at the upper portion of a reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a mixing-type shower head. Here, first and second reaction gases enter into a shower head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the same time or at different times, according to the opening or closing action of valves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, via intakes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively. The first and second reaction gases are mixed in the shower head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, exit through outlets <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of the shower head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and are deposited on a substrate (not shown) loaded in a reaction chamber. However, in the mixing-type shower head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having such a configuration, the first and second reaction gases, particularly if they are mutually reactive, react with each other and form particles, which are deposited within the shower head <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the shower head is easily contaminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show a separative type shower head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for separately providing first and second reaction gases, to solve the above problem. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, different passages are provided to prevent the first and second reaction gases from reacting with each other within the shower head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such that the first and second reaction gases are discharged respectively via separate sets of interspersed outlets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. However, when PCVD is performed using the separative type shower head <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the first reaction gas and other reactants remaining within the reaction chamber flow backward and into the passage for the second reaction gas, because there is no downward flow at that point coming from the passage for the second reaction gas. Then, when the second reaction gas is delivered, it reacts with the first gas and other reactants, thereby producing contaminating particles. Likewise, the same thing occurs in the passage for the first reaction gas, which becomes contaminated with the second reaction gas when only the second reaction gas is flowing. evident that setting the flow rate of purge gas to over about 500 sccm prevents contaminating particles from being produced. However, it can be seen that setting the flow rate of the purge gas to over 500 sccm greatly reduces the speed of growth of the TiN film. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of delivering gas whereby problems of both an increase in contaminating particles and a reduction in deposition rate can be solved, and to provide a shower head appropriate for the gas delivery method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to achieve the first object, the present invention provides a gas delivery method in which a first reaction gas is delivered toward the edge of the substrate, and the other reaction gases are delivered toward the central portion of the substrate, each of the reaction gases being delivered via independent gas outlets to prevent the reaction gases from being mixed. Here, the predetermined film can be deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) or pulsed chemical vapor deposition (PCVD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The other reaction gases include second and third reaction gases each reactive to the first reaction gas, and the second and third reaction gases can be delivered simultaneously with the first reaction gas. The second and third reaction gases can be simultaneously delivered via the same gas outlet to be mixed with each other or alternately delivered via the same gas outlet at different times to prevent the two reaction gases from being mixed. Alternatively, the second and third reaction gases can be delivered via independent gas outlets, respectively, to prevent the two reaction gases from being mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a gas delivery method including: delivering the first reaction gas toward the edge of the substrate for a designated period of time; purging the reaction gas remaining within the reaction chamber while blocking the inflow of the first reaction gas; delivering the second reaction gas toward the central portion of the substrate for a designated period of time; and purging the reaction gas remaining within the reaction chamber while blocking the inflow of the second reaction gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the steps of delivering the first reaction gas and the second reaction gas, each of the first and second reaction gases is delivered together with a carrier gas in order to smoothly supply the first and second reaction gases. The reaction chamber is purged by continuously delivering only the carrier gas while blocking the first and second reaction gases during each of the purging steps. Also, the first reaction gas delivering step, the purging step, the second reaction gas delivering step, and the purging step can be repeated to deposit the material to a desired thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The shower head appropriate for carrying out the above method is installed at the upper portion of a reaction chamber in which a substrate is seated on the lower portion. The shower head has a gas supply line formed on the upper surface of the shower head for receiving a first reaction gas from a supply source of the first reaction gas; gas supply lines formed on the upper surface of the shower head for receiving other reaction gases from a supply source of the other reaction gases; a plurality of outlets for the first reaction gas formed along the edge of the lower surface of the shower head for discharging the first reaction gas; a plurality of outlets for each of the other reaction gases formed on the central portion of the lower surface of the shower head, for discharging the other reaction gases; a gas passage formed within the body of the shower head, for connecting the gas supply line for the first reaction gas to the plurality of outlets for the first reaction gas; and gas passages formed independently of the gas passage for the first reaction gas within the body of the shower head, for connecting the supply lines for the other reaction gases to the plurality of outlets for each of the other reaction gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Here, the plurality of outlets for the first reaction gas can be extended further downward toward the substrate than the plurality of outlets for each of the other reaction gases such that the plurality of outlets for the first reaction gas are closer to the substrate installed in the chamber than the plurality of outlets for each of the other reaction gases when the shower head is installed in the upper portion of the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, one of the mutually-reactive reaction gases is delivered toward the edges of a substrate, and the others are delivered independently toward the center of the substrate. Thus, generation of contaminating particles within a shower head and a reaction chamber can be prevented, and a high deposition rate can be obtained.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described referring to the attached drawings. First, the structure of a shower head appropriate for a gas delivery method according to the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show the configuration of a shower head according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, gas supply lines <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, for first and second reaction gases, and respective valves <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are installed over a shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment. Supply lines <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for a purge gas (carrier gas) transfer the first and second reaction gases and purge the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a reaction chamber (not shown). Supply lines <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are equipped with valves <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The interior of the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has passages for first and second reaction gases to prevent the first and second reaction gases from being mixed. In particular, one reaction gas is allowed to be discharged to outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed around the outer edge of the bottom surface of the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the other reaction gas is allowed to be discharged to outlets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed in a central portion of the bottom surface of the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the bottom surface of the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which are spaced apart from each other along the edge, and a plurality of second reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which are spaced apart from each other in the central portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In particular, instead of being interspersed across the bottom surface of the conventional shower head as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are grouped around the outside edge of the bottom surface of the shower head, and the second reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are grouped in the central portion of the bottom surface of the shower head. Therefore, when delivering the first reaction gas from the first gas outlets grouped along the outside edge of the bottom surface of the shower head, there is less backward flow of the first reaction gas into the gas outlets for the second reaction gas than there would be in the conventional interspersed shower head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A third reaction gas which is reactive to the first reaction gas can be supplied together with the second reaction gas through the second reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Here, if the second and third reaction gases do not react with each other or weakly react with each other, they can be supplied simultaneously. On the other hand, if they are reactive, they can be alternately supplied at different times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show the configuration of a shower head according to another embodiment of the present invention. The shower head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> is obtained by further adding a third reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and third reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to the shower head shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. Here, third reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are independent of first and second reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Third reaction gas passages for connecting the third reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to each of the third reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are separate from the first and second reaction gas passages, such that the three reaction gases can be delivered independently of one another. Third reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is also provided with a purge gas line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and valve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In any of the shower heads of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 9</cross-reference>, the first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be extended farther downward than the second/third reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, so that the first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are closer to a substrate loaded in a reaction chamber. This is illustrated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. This downward extension of the first reaction gas outlets further assists in preventing backward flow of the first reaction gas into the second (or third) reaction gas outlets. It is also preferable that the first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> face the edge of a substrate or are located beyond the outside of the substrate, so that the diameter of the shower head is greater than or equal to that of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A method of delivering gas according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference> conceptually illustrate processes for delivering gases according to embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> first reaction gas and a carrier gas come out of outlets <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> formed on the edge of a shower head and flow toward the edge of a substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> loaded on a substrate holder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrows B. A second reaction gas and a carrier gas come out of outlets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> formed in the central portion of the shower head and flow toward the central portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrow A. In this way, a direct purging effect of a purge gas (carrier gas) on a substrate is reduced, so that a reduction in the deposition rate is prevented despite an increase in the flow rate of the purge gas. In addition, since the outlets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are segregated from each other, the first and second reaction gases cannot easily flow backward into outlets for the second and first reaction gases respectively, so that contamination of the interior of the shower head and gas lines is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Here, it is preferable that the first reaction gas outlets <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> face the outside edge of the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or are located beyond the edge of the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in order to prevent excessive purging of the second reaction gas adsorbed on the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This is easily accomplished by using a shower head whose diameter is greater than or equal to the diameter of the substrate, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> conceptually shows a process for delivering a gas according to another embodiment of the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, only the second reaction gas is delivered from a shower head as indicated by arrow A, and the first reaction gas is delivered upward from gas outlets <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> located at the edge of the lower portion of the reaction chamber as indicated by arrows E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The first and second reaction gases in the above-described embodiments can be delivered in a PCVD method. PCVD is more fully described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/156,724 filed on Sep. 18, 1998 by a common Assignee, entitled &ldquo;Method of Forming Metal Nitride Film by Chemical Vapor Deposition and Method of Forming Metal Contact of Semiconductor Device Using the Same&rdquo;, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/156,724, PCVD is a type of CVD where reaction gases and purge gases are alternately introduced for a predetermined amount of time in a sequence of a first reaction gas, a purge gas, a second reaction gas, and the purge gas. PCVD is similar to ALD, but PCVD significantly increases the deposition rate with both chemically-adsorbed and physically-adsorbed reaction gases remaining on a substrate, while only the chemically-adsorbed reaction gas remains on the substrate in the ALD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The embodiment according to the present invention applied to the PCVD will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> First, a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or a wafer boat (not shown) on which a plurality of substrates are loaded is loaded into a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> structured as shown in any of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference>. The temperature and pressure within the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are set to predetermined levels and stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, a valve installed on the first reaction gas supply line is opened, and a first reaction gas is thus delivered for a predetermined period of time as indicated by arrow B, C, D or E. The first reaction gas delivered toward the edge of the wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is physically or chemically adsorbed on the wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Here, a carrier gas together with the first reaction gas can be delivered for a smooth supply of the first reaction gas. An inert gas is used as the carrier gas, and can be delivered via the supply line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for a purge gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The valve installed on the first reaction gas supply line is closed to block the supply of the first reaction gas, and the purge gas is delivered for a predetermined period of time to purge reaction gases remaining within the shower head or the reaction chamber without being adsorbed on the wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Here, when the carrier gas is delivered together with the first reaction gas, purging is performed by blocking only the first reaction gas and continuously delivering the carrier gas, without the need to deliver a special purge gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A second reaction gas is delivered for a predetermined period of time as indicated by the arrows A. The second reaction gas delivered toward the central portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> reacts with the first reaction gas adsorbed on the wafer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to form a desired material film. Here, an inert carrier gas can be delivered together with the second reaction gas to achieve a smooth supply of the second reaction gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A purge gas is delivered for a predetermined period of time while blocking the supply of the second reaction gas, thereby purging reaction gases or contaminating particles remaining within the shower head and the reaction chamber. Here, when a carrier gas is delivered together with the second reaction gas, the carrier gas is continuously delivered while only the second reaction gas is blocked, thereby performing a purging operation without the need to deliver a special purge gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Such a cycle of delivering the first reaction gas, purging, delivering the second reaction gas, and purging can be repeated until a material film having a desired thickness is formed. Also, the order of the first and second reaction gases to be delivered can be changed according to the property of a film desired to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> An experimental example is provided below, wherein a material film is deposited on a substrate by a PCVD method using a gas delivery method according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the present experimental example, a TiN film is formed on a substrate using each of the shower heads shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference> to compare the effect of a conventional gas delivery method with that of a gas delivery method according to the present invention. NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are used as first and second reaction gases, respectively, and Ar is used as both a carrier gas and a purge gas.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from Table 1, although the two methods have similar deposition rates, they differ widely from each other in the number of contaminating particles formed on a substrate. That is, more than 8000 contaminating particles are observed in the conventional method, but less than 50 contaminating particles are observed in the method according to the present invention. As described above, when the flow rate of the carrier and purge gas (Ar) is increased in the conventional method, the number of contaminating particles is reduced. If the flow rate of Ar is increased to 600 sccm without a change in the other conditions in the conventional method having the above-described described conditions, the number of contaminating particles is reduced, but the deposition rate is decreased to 8 &angst;/min or less. This low deposition rate impedes the use of the conventional method in a mass-production method of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also, it is evident that the method according to the present invention can obtain superior results compared to the conventional method not only in the deposition rate and the number of contaminating particles, but also in the surface resistance and the uniformity of the surface resistance. That is, it is preferable that a deposited TiN film in the present experimental example has a surface resistance as low as possible since it is generally used as a barrier metal layer. As can be seen from Table 1, the method according to the present invention obtains a smaller surface resistance than the surface resistance of the conventional method, and also obtains excellent results in the uniformity of the surface resistance. Here, the surface resistance was measured at 49 different places on a substrate by a four-point probe method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments according to the present invention and experimental example of a method of delivering mutually-reactive first and second reaction gases have been disclosed above. The gas delivery method according to the present invention is applicable not only to a deposition process using two reaction gases but also to a deposition process using three reaction gases or more such as BST ((Ba,Sr)TiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) or the like. In such a deposition process using three reaction gases, reaction gases can be delivered via the shower head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Here, the reaction gas which most easily flows backward is supplied to the edge of the substrate via the first reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the remaining reaction gases are supplied to the central portion of the substrate via the second and third reaction gas supply lines <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In a case when the second and third reaction gases do not mutually react with each other or weakly react with each other, the shower head <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> or a gas delivery system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference> can be used. That is, one reaction gas having a strong reactivity is delivered toward the edge of the substrate via the first reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (or as indicated by arrow B, C, D or E) while the remaining second and third reaction gases are delivered toward the central portion of the substrate via the second reaction gas supply line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (or as indicated by arrow A). Here, the second and third reaction gases can be delivered simultaneously, or can be delivered alternately at different times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to the gas delivery method and the shower head according to the present invention as described above, in which mutually-reactive reaction gases are delivered to a substrate, one of the mutually-reactive gases is delivered toward the edge of the substrate, and the others are delivered toward the central portion of the substrate. Therefore, the deposition rate can be increased, and contaminating particles can be prevented from being produced within the shower head and a reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth above, and it is clearly understood that many variations may be made within the scope of the present invention by anyone of skill in the art. </paragraph>
