<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to tableware and, more particularly, to tableware pieces each having a question or command printed thereon for generating discussion among dining partners. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tableware, such as glasses, dishes, napkin rings, napkins, placemats, eating utensils, table decorations, party favors, and the like, are commonly used as service pieces for entertaining guests, such as at dinner parties and other social gatherings. Traditionally, each table setting includes multiple tableware pieces sufficient to serve multiple courses of a meal, such as an appetizer, a salad, soup, an entree, and a desert. However, such tableware may also be used in less formal situations for entertaining smaller groups of people. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While entertaining, it is common for hosts to attempt to facilitate conversation among their guests. However, this frequently develops into semi-private conversations among small sub-groups of individuals. These conversations often become superficial in nature. It is sometimes preferable to attempt to engage all guests in a group discussion to facilitate conversation among new acquaintances and/or promote the developments of new relationships. By way of non-limiting example, it is preferable to facilitate group discussion among guests during social picnics, dinner parties, brunches, or on retreats or cruises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a method of facilitating, generating, or promoting conversation and discussion among dining partners. Furthermore, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide tableware that is capable of facilitating such conversation among dining partners. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the broad teachings of this invention, tableware capable of facilitating conversation or discussion among guests and a method of using the same is provided. The method includes: a) providing a set of open-ended questions or commands each being separately printed on a surface of a dining-piece; b) distributing one or more of the dining-pieces to each dining partner; c) having each dining partner read aloud the open-ended question or comment printed on-their dining-piece; d) having one of the dining partners answer the open-ended question; and e) engaging all of the dining partners in open discussion of alternate answers to the question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the, art from this detailed description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For example, the present invention may be used during any meal, such as breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, supper, a picnic, or at any time a conversation or a discussion between dining partners is encouraged. Moreover, the present invention may find utility in various applications such as residential, commercial, corporate, cruise, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For purposes of this description, the term &ldquo;tableware,&rdquo; &ldquo;tableware piece,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dining-piece&rdquo; shall each include any plate, saucer, charger, bowl, cup, glass, goblet, napkin holder, napkin, placemat, table utensil, table decoration, party favor, and/or any other piece or item used in setting a table for a meal, such as breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, supper, a picnic, and the like. The terms &ldquo;tableware,&rdquo; &ldquo;tableware piece,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dining-piece&rdquo; may be used interchangeably. This tableware shall be made of conventional materials, such as china, earthenware, stoneware, porcelain, plastic, glass, silver, gold, steel, paper, expanded rigid polystyrene plastic such as STYROFOAM&trade;, or any other material or composition commonly used in manufacturing formal, everyday, or disposable tableware products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a conversation-generating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes at least one tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defining a top or exposed surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a bottom or unexposed surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Exposed surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally exposed to the view of the user when tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed on a table and, in terms of a plate, would be the side in which food or other tableware is placed. On the other hand, unexposed surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is generally concealed from the view of the user when tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed on a table and, again in terms of a plate, would be the non-food side that is placed downwardly. It is anticipated that conversation-generating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include any number of tableware or dining pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Each tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> printed on a surface thereof or otherwise affixed thereto. In the interest of brevity, open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be referred to as open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> unless otherwise noted. However, it should be appreciated that a command that instructs a guest to describe an experience, situation, opinion, or the like is within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is printed on unexposed surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to prevent a user from reading the question or command prior to a discussion or conversation. However, open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may also be printed on exposed surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be preferably covered by food or other tableware. It is anticipated that open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is printed on or affixed to tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a known manner, such as by forming the lettering under a coating applied to the tableware piece either during or after the manufacturing process. This printing method would allow, for a smooth, unobstructed, durable finish on the surface thereof. Such printing of open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in this manner also prevents the lettering from contaminating any food items placed on or in tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated that any printing or affixing method known to one skilled in the art may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is generally defined as a question or command that-allows for a spontaneous, unstructured response that typically has no right or wrong answer. Open-ended questions or commands commonly allow a respondent to elaborate on their own personal thoughts, opinions, feelings, or experience relating to a specific topic. Preferably, open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is chosen from topics relating to politics, history, movies, theatre, sports, children, marriage, dating, religion, famous people, television, education, alma maters, space, general matters, personal experiences, festive occasions, and the like. It should be noted that open-ended, question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be any question which allows for a spontaneous, unstructured response. By way of non-limiting example, the following open-ended questions represent, a varied cross-section of possible alternatives that are believed to elicit a spontaneous, unstructured response:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each guest receives at least one tableware piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This tableware piece would include a unique open-ended question <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is unlike any of the remaining open-ended questions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The use of conversation-generating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described in further detail. As set forth above, the present invention may be used for a variety of entertaining situations. However, in the interest of brevity, the use of conversation generating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to a dinner party environment or other formal occasion. Place settings for formal dinner parties typically include the largest number of individual tableware pieces, such as plates, saucers, chargers, bowls, cups, glasses, goblets, napkin holders, napkins, placemats, table utensils, table decorations, party favors, and the like and, thus, provide the opportunity for the most complete description of the preferred embodiment. However, this detailed description shall not be interpreted to limit this application in that this invention may be used with a single tableware piece with a single open-ended question or command printed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To use conversation-generating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, each guest or dining partner randomly receives a complete set of tableware defining a single place setting. Preferably, each piece of tableware <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> printed on unexposed surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The printing of open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on unexposed surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> prevents each guest from knowing his/her questions. This prevents each guest from knowing and preparing a response to the open-ended question beforehand. Consequently, the intent of eliciting spontaneous, unstructured answers and opinions, is maintained. However, it is anticipated that in the alternative, open-ended question or command <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be printed on exposed surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of tableware <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When these questions or commands are printed on exposed surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, they may be obscured from view by food or beverage or may be revealed to the guest upon sitting at the table. The specific time at which the open-ended questions or commands are revealed to the guest may be determined by the host and may be tailored to suite the desired atmosphere of the social gathering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> At a time to be determined by the host, each guest or dining partner is asked to uncover, if necessary, the open-ended question or command that is printed on a specific piece of tableware and read it aloud to the remaining dining partners. This is preferably done prior to the serving of the next course. The guest then answers the open-ended question or command aloud, thereby sharing with the remaining dining partners their own thoughts, opinions, feelings, and/or experiences relating to the topic. The remaining dining partners are then engaged in a group discussion relating to the open-ended question or command and/or the answer(s) provided by their fellow dining partner(s). Once the group discussion is substantially exhausted or at a time determined by the host, another guest is asked to read aloud and answer aloud the open-ended question or command printed on one of their specific pieces of tableware and the process is repeated for each guest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, one guest may read, the open-ended question or command, while another guest-responds to the question, or command. It is important to note that there may be variations to this method that are within the scope of this application which still provide for eliciting a spontaneous, unstructured response to facilitate conversation among guests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By providing each guest with multiple tableware pieces having a different open-ended question or command printed thereon, each guest may have multiple turns of reading aloud and answering aloud their specific questions or command. It is also anticipated that the present invention may be used by two or more dining partners. For example, the present invention may be particularly useful in quickly getting to know the personal opinions and/or experiences of someone that one is dating or seeking to employ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways, such as with some editions centered on a certain theme and/or limits on production volumes. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. Such variations or modifications, as would be obvious to one skilled in the art, are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
