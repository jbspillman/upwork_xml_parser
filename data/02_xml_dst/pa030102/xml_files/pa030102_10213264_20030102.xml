<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the automation of signal processing apparatus such as, for example, a digital audio mixing console. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In conventional automated audio mixing consoles, the time-dependent operation of the console is synchronized with respect to a single timecode signal. This timecode signal is usually provided by, for example, a tape recorder associated with the console. Items which are synchronized with the timecode signal include the automation of the console control positions, such as the positions of control faders and potentiometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is possible to operate a console to receive audio signals from two or more tape recorders running at different speeds. However, in a conventional console it is then necessary to automate the desk in accordance with the timecode signal from one of the tape recorders only. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide signal processing apparatus which alleviates the problems identified above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention provides signal processing apparatus in which at least two sets of automated signal processing functions are controlled by stored automation commands, at times dependent upon at least two respective timecode signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention recognises that problems can arise with a console receiving signals from at least two sources (e.g. tape recorders) but which is synchronised to only one timecode signal, especially in cases when the replay speed of one of the signal sources is varied. Automated processing operations acting on the signal from one source but which are synchronised to the timecode of the other source can become out of step with the signal to be processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention addresses this problem by providing signal processing apparatus (e.g. a mixing console) in which subsets of parts or functions of the apparatus are operable in synchronism with respective different timecode signals. In this way, if two or more sources of timecode are used with the console, then each of the time code signals can be associated with a respective set of mixing controls. This means that the mixer controls used in the mixing of the output of a tape recorder are automated in synchronism with the timecode from that source (e.g. tape recorder). If the tape recorder is operated at a slightly different speed, the timing of the automated edit points changes so that the automated operations occur at the appropriate time in the replayed or recorded audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Each timecode signal may be associated with a respective source signal supplied to the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably the apparatus is an audio mixing console, such as a digital audio mixing console. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although the apparatus could compare each automation command with a predetermined list of automated operations for each of the timecodes, there is greater flexibility of operation if the timecodes are specified for each individual automation command. To this end, it is preferred that the apparatus comprises means for receiving automation commands, each comprising an automation control command and information specifying one of the timecode signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although the automation commands could be supplied externally, it is preferred that the receiving means comprises means for retrieving automation commands stored on a storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably the storage medium is a magnetic disk medium, a magnetic tape medium or an optical disk medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to the automation commands, it is preferred that the apparatus also comprises means for recording and/or retrieving an automation database on the storage medium, the automation database specifying automation points within the signal processing apparatus on which the stored automation commands were generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The stored automation database may advantageously be used later not only to convert the automation data on that storage medium for use on other consoles, but also as a check that automation data being retrieved for use with a particular console was originated on a console of the same or a compatible design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to use the stored automation database as a check that the automation commands are compatible with the apparatus currently retrieving those commands, it is preferred that the apparatus comprises means for comparing the retrieved automation database with an automation database associated with the apparatus, to detect whether the stored automation commands are compatible with the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In previous mixing consoles, the automation commands have specified the physical position of particular console controls such as faders or potentiometers. This makes the automation commands specific not only to a particular layout of console but also to the particular fader response laws used to map the position of the faders into control quantities (e.g. gain or filter response characteristics) to be applied to the signal. In order to reduce this specificity, thus allowing easier translation of automation commands from one console to another, in embodiments of the invention it is preferred that the automation commands specify respective control quantities to be applied to a source signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides signal processing apparatus in which automated signal processing functions are controlled by stored automation commands, the apparatus comprising means, responsive to a detection of an automation command in a current set of automation commands calling a further set of automation commands, for initiating execution of the further set of automation commands. Such apparatus conveniently allows lists or sets of automation commands to be &ldquo;nested&rdquo; so that one set can call another set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides signal processing apparatus in which automated signal processing functions are controlled by stored automation commands, the automation commands specifying respective control quantities to be applied to a source signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides a storage medium on which automation commands for a signal processing apparatus are stored, each stored automation command having associated stored information specifying one of at least two timecode signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides a storage medium on which automation commands for an automated signal processing apparatus and an automation database is stored, the automation database specifying the automation points within the signal processing apparatus on which the stored automation commands were generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides a method of translating automation commands generated at a first command rate on a first automated signal processing apparatus into automation commands at a second command rate for use on a second automated signal processing apparatus, the method comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> sample-rate converting the automation commands from the first command rate to the second command rate; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> mapping the sample-rate converted automation commands into equivalent commands for use on the second automated signal processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides a method of translating automation commands stored on a storage medium and generated on a first automated signal processing apparatus into automation commands for use on a second automated signal processing apparatus, the storage medium storing an automation database specifying automation points within the first automated signal processing apparatus, the method comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> retrieving the automation database; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> comparing the retrieved automation database with a second automation database associated with the second apparatus, to generate a mapping table defining a mapping of the automation commands generated on the first apparatus to automation commands for use on the second apparatus; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> translating, in accordance with the mapping table, the stored automation commands into automation commands for use on the second apparatus.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> small part of the channel processing for one audio channel of a digital audio mixing console comprises a fader (potentiometer) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a unit converting the position of the fader into a control quantity (such as decibels of gain) for processing the audio data of that channel, a summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a coefficient generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a multiplier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In operation, a user can specify the gain to be applied to an input audio signal by moving the fader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The physical position of the fader is digitised and passed to the position converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The position conversion unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> maps the digitised position of the fader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> onto a corresponding gain value in decibels, to be passed to the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> operates under the control of a status signal (which can be set by the user operating a panel control) with the following possible modes of operation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> 1) Fully manual operation in which the summation unit simply passes the output of the position conversion unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the coefficient generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 2) Fully automated operation in which the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> stored on, for example, an automation tape or disc to the coefficient generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The output of the position converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not used; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 3) Automated operation with manual override in which the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adds the stored automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to any detected change (A) in the output of the position converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this way, the automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is used as a default, but can be overridden by the user moving the fader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The output of the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, representing in this example a signal gain in decibels, is then supplied to the coefficient generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which converts that required signal gain into a multiplication coefficient; the input audio data is then multiplied by that multiplication factor in the multiplier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> supplied to the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is equivalent in form and meaning to the output of the position converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In other words, the automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> specifies a control quantity (in this example, a gain in decibels; in other examples, the control quantity might define a filter response) to be applied to the signal, rather than merely representing the physical position of a control fader or potentiometer. As described below, this feature makes the transfer of automation data between different consoles much more straightforward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating the processing structure of a digital audio mixing console. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the user operates controls on a control panel or desk <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. These controls might be switches, faders, potentiometers and the like. The panel also provides displays of, for example, signal level, signal routing, equalizer operation and the like. A panel processor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> processes data received from the panel <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and data to be displayed on the panel <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The panel processor is in turn connected to a control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which receives information from the panel processor indicative of control positions set by the user on the panel, and uses that information to control the operation of a signal processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The signal processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives digital audio data and, in response to control information supplied by the control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, performs various multiple filtering and mixing operations on the digital audio data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the fader <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> forms part of the panel <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, with the panel processor <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> controlling the digitising of the fader position. The position converter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and coefficient generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are embodied by the control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Finally, the only part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is actually part of the signal path, the multiplier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is provided by the signal processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the automation data <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> supplied to the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is actually routed to the control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the signal processor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are in fact programmable digital data processing devices running suitable object code to provide the functions described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating the generation of the object code for use in the digital audio mixing console of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The basic technique for generating suitable object code is described in the following documents, all of which are incorporated herein by reference: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To summarise the technique described in the above references, a schematic circuit diagram similar in form to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is set up on a computer-aided design (CAD) system. A netlist is generated from the CAD representation and is then compiled to produce the object code for running on the control processor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the signal processor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, these stages are shown as a single compilation stage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The above process is as described in the three references specified above. A modification of the process in the present embodiment is the generation of an automation database <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This is a schedule of all of the automation &ldquo;points&rdquo; (such as the input to the summation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) specified in the CAD representation of a particular digital mixing console. In other words, the automation database <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides a list of operations in the mixing console which can be automated. When a set of automation data generated on a particular console is stored on a tape or disc, the automation database for that console is stored on the same medium. This means that the storage medium contains information (the automation database) specifying the system on which that automation data was generated. This can be used later not only to convert the automation data for use on other consoles, but also as a check that automation data being retrieved for use with a particular console was originated on a console of the same design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In other words, this embodiment allows the production of storage media (magnetic tapes, magnetic or optical disks, electronic memories etc) holding an automation database and a series of automation commands (which may include timecode information as discussed below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the above coding and compilation steps could be performed manually using a known computer programming language. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic flowchart showing the translation of automation data from one digital audio mixing console to another similar (but different) console using the automation database. This translation can be performed using, for example, a suitably programmed general purpose computer, or by a suitable program running on a programmable signal processing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At a step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the automation database <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is read from the storage medium on which it is provided. The automated functions, such as &ldquo;channel 1 input gain&rdquo; are then mapped at a step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to identical or corresponding functions in the target mixing console by comparison of the database <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the corresponding database for the target console, to generate a mapping or look-up table. If there are any ambiguities, or any functions in the original console which do not map to target functions in the target console, these ambiguities can be clarified at a step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by requesting input from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At the end of the step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, there exists a mapping table which maps each item of possible automation data from the original console (console <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) onto a corresponding function in the target console (console <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). At a step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, this mapping table is applied to each successive command of the automation data from the original console to generate automation data for the target console. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is schematic flowchart showing the translation of automation data from one digital audio mixing console to another digital audio mixing console without using an automation database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In general, automation data from a particular system refers to sampled control positions at a particular sampling rate (for example, 100 Hz). The first stage, therefore, is sample rate conversion (a step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) under the control of clock signals defining the sampling rate for automation data in the original and target systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> At a step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> the encoding of the control positions, and the resulting effect of those control movements on the processing of the audio signals, are converted to those of the target system using a manually-generated look-up table <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Finally, the location of the automated controls on the mixing console must be mapped to the corresponding locations of controls on the target mixing console at a step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, again using a manually generated look-up table <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a digital mixing console operating in accordance with more than one timecode signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In conventional audio mixing consoles, the time-dependent operation of the console is synchronised by a single timecode signal. This signal is usually provided by, for example, a tape recorder associated with the console. Items which are synchronised with the timecode signal include the automation of the console controls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, two tape recorders <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are used with a single mixing console <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Each tape recorder supplies a respective audio signal and a respective timecode signal to the console <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The automation of the console <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is controlled by an automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, to be described in more detail below. The automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> receives both of the timecode signals from the two tape recorders and accesses stored automation data from, for example, a floppy disc storage medium <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The stored automation data is similar to conventional automation data or to automation data described above, except that each automation command has an associated timecode identifying number (TC &num;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The automation controller detects the timecode number associated with each automation command, and carries out the operation defined by that command in synchronism with the appropriate one of the timecodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate a benefit of such a scheme, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are schematic diagrams of an editing operation showing the use <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>more than one timecode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows one track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the signal replayed from one of the tape recorders <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> being faded into a track <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> replayed from the other of the tape recorders <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The fade is intended to start at a position A and to end at a position B in the track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, only one timecode is used to determine the automation of the mixing console, and so the points at which the track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is faded in and out are specified with respect to the timecode of the track <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. This can lead to problems if, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the relative speeds of the two tape recorders are changed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is replayed slightly slower than the track <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and so the fade in and out points defined with respect to the timecode of the track <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> do not occur at the correct points on the track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the fade in and out points for the track <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are defined with respect to the timecode associated with that track (<highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>). However, other editing operations relevant to the track <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are defined with respect to the timecode associated with that track (<highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>). This means that a slight change in relative speed of the different tape recorders does not affect the accuracy of selected cue points or editing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating the operation of the console of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In particular, the automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> comprises an automation command router <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and two automation sub-controllers <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Each of the automation sub-controllers receives one of the timecode signals from a respective tape recorder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and controls the operation of respective parts of the mixing console, such that the automated operation of any particular part of the console is controlled by either one or the other of the automation sub-controllers. Apart from the fact that the automation sub-controllers <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> control only a sub-set of the operation of the mixing console, they are otherwise conventional or as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The automation command router <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> receives the automation commands and associated timecode numbers from the storage medium <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The automation command router <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> then routes automation commands for which the timecode number specifies the timecode of the tape recorder <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the automation sub-controller <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. Similarly, where the timecode number specifies the tape recorder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, commands are routed to the other automation sub-controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the automation commands are recorded onto the floppy disk <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the user indicates which console controls, or alternatively which particular commands, are to be associated with the various timecodes (e.g. TC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, TC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). This can be done simply by selecting particular controls on a screen-driven menu, or by depressing timecode selection switches associated with particular controls or groups of controls. After this selection has been carried out, the automation data is recorded conventionally, except that a short (e.g. one byte) code is appended to (or otherwise associated with) each automation command, to form the timecode identifier for that command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The systems described above perform automation of the console controls using a single linear series of automation commands known as an edit decision list (EDL). As described above, these commands may be associated with different respective timecode sources, but the EDL is still essentially a serial list of commands to be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, however, EDLs can be &ldquo;nested&rdquo;, so that one EDL can call another EDL and either transfer control to the called EDL or execute commands of the called EDL in parallel with commands of the calling EDL. This feature can be used with or without the multiple timecode operation described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrate an example of this process, in which a called EDL is executed in parallel with existing commands of the calling EDL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates an EDL which is read by the automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> from the floppy disk <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and stored in a random access memory (not shown) in the automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The EDL comprises a series of commands, numbered <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> . . . , to be executed at respective times. However, one of the commands, command <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is actually a &ldquo;call&rdquo; command, which calls a second EDL illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The called EDL comprises only three commands, referred to as commands a, b and c, which have respective times of operation as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In order to execute the call, the automation controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> reads the EDL of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the floppy disk <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and superimposes the commands of the EDL of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>onto the EDL of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as held in the random access memory to form a composite EDL as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Commands of the composite EDL are then executed serially, as normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> If control is to be transferred to the called EDL, then the automation controller simply has to erase the remaining commands of the calling EDL when the called EDL is loaded into the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
