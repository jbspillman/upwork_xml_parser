<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an optical device that filters wavelengths of light, and can be used to sense deposited chemical or biological materials. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to satisfy the bandwidth demand arising from increased use of the internet, the optical telecommunications (telecom) industry have incorporated wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in its networks. Entirely new classes of optical devices and systems are needed to manipulate and distribute the multiple channels (defined by wavelengths of light) envisioned by optical network designers. Tunable transmitters using tunable lasers as the source, are becoming a standard replacing multiple fixed wavelength lasers. On a receiving end however, the wavelength distinction is currently accomplished by fixed wavelength, discrete components such as fiber Bragg grating filters, thin film interference filters, arrayed waveguide grating circuits, or grating based de-multiplexers. This is analogous to the early days of radio where each broadcast channel required a fixed crystal oscillator at the receiver. To produce tunable receivers for telecom networks, a suitable tunable filter technology is needed, an equivalent to radio&apos;s electronically tuned oscillator which replaced multiple channel filters with a single dynamic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is an immediate need for dynamic devices which can actively tune between channels with low signal loss, combining the function of both switches and multiplexers. A tunable filter device can replace both switches and space multiplexers, yielding a reconfigurable tunable switch module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many approaches for producing tunable filters are under development, but few of these have the potential to be commercially accepted. Here we describe a new approach for constructing both fixed and tunable filters which has the advantage of low cost production combined with the narrow band operation and filter shape requirements of telecom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On a new matter, optical sensors that can detect the presence and concentration of a material deposited on a surface have a great number of applications in the fields of biotechnology and chemical analysis. High sensitivity pollution sensors, for example, are typically used to detect the presence of contaminants in water supplies and in the air we breath. A wide range of benefits can be realized in the biotechnology field if a sensor could detect the concentration of viruses and bacteria in a sample of blood or identify various proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typical biological sensors (biosensors) utilize fluorescent chemical compounds which are used to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; various protein or DNA molecules. When such molecules are deposited onto a surface through attachment to &ldquo;receptor&rdquo; chemicals, the presence and concentration of the tagged chemicals can be determined by the brightness of the light emitted by the fluorescent compounds. Recently, this technique gained prominence due to the rapid sequencing of the human genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence-based biosensors are limited to the extent that the fluorescent compounds used are not applicable to all materials, such as the huge number of proteins generated in the human body. In many applications, a highly sensitive detection method is needed which does not require the use of fluorescent chemical tags. Such a method can be realized using an optical resonance phenomenon such as the highly complex surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Using a surface structure resonance phenomena, the optical filters described herein can be used to produce biosensors, which can detect minute concentrations of chemicals through a shift in the wavelength of light resonated from the sensor&apos;s surface. This type of response cannot be obtained from other filtering methods such as thin-film interference filters and fiber Bragg grating filters. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves a guided mode resonance surface structure optical filter that does not exhibit polarization dependence. That is, an incident beam of light need not be properly oriented so that it strikes the device in a particular way for the incident light to be adjusted or tuned properly. Instead, incident light having any polarization orientation can be adjusted or tuned. This is achieved via a circular symmetry supported by an array of surface structures with various crosssectional shapes. One or more dimensions of the surface structure can be smaller than the wavelength of light that is reflected or redirected such that no light is scattered or diffracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed toward providing an optical wavelength filter device for filtering wavelengths in optical telecommunications systems. Typically, a filter structure according to certain principles of the present invention experiences minimal loss due to a polarization state of incoming light. This is achieved by providing a guided-mode surface structure filter that is formed of dielectric bodies of various predetermined shapes such as cylinders or holes repeated over the surface of a substrate and arranged in a predetermined symmetrical pattern such as a honeycomb or hexagon. It is noted that the term &ldquo;body&rdquo; as used herein may include &ldquo;holes&rdquo; filled with air or some other dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, a honeycomb surface pattern of such bodies can provide a high degree of circular symmetry, which allows a light beam comprising a broad range of wavelengths to be filtered efficiently without undue loss caused by the polarization state of incident light. In other words, the optical device according to the present invention can be polarization independent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed towards an optical filter having one or multiple guided-mode surface structures to reflect a narrow range of light wavelengths from a broad spectrum of incident light. A surface structure can include a body of material forming an array or field of cylindrical holes, cylinders, or other suitable shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one application, two or more guided-mode resonance surface structures can be disposed substantially parallel and opposite to each other, thus forming a resonant cavity therebetween. Light reflections from each structure provide unique filtering, thereby narrowing the wavelength range of light that is reflected off the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another application, multiple guided-mode resonance surface structures can be grouped to form more than one resonant cavity. Light reflections from each cavity provide unique filtering, and light reflections from each cavity can be weakly or strongly coupled to the other cavities, thereby narrowing and shaping the wavelength range of light that is reflected off the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed towards an optical wavelength filter device optimized to meet the isolation, loss, and narrow pass bands required by optical telecommunications applications. This can be achieved by providing two or more guided-mode surface structures (polarization independent filters) disposed substantially parallel or angled with respect to each other to form the aforesaid resonant cavity. In one application, an electro-optic medium having a controllable index of refraction can be disposed within the resonant cavity to adjust which of multiple wavelengths will be transmitted or reflected. An electric field can be applied to adjust the index of refraction of the electro-optic medium. Alternatively, the surface structure or bodies can be formed of an electro-optic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention involves utilizing liquid crystal material as an electro-optic material to effect the polarization independent operation of a dynamically tunable pass band, guided-mode surface structure optical filter. This can be achieved by effecting the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules such that in the static state, when no electric field is present, the molecules align their extraordinary refractive index axis perpendicular to corresponding surfaces in the cavity such as the columns or holes in the optical device. Such an alignment can be replicated within a bulk layer of liquid crystal material filing the cavity to form a tunable surface structure filter. In this manner, the liquid crystal molecular alignment can reflect the circular symmetry of the polarization independent properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention involves providing a low loss pass band and isolation filter for use in optical telecommunications. This can be achieved using just a single guided-mode, polarization independent, surface structure filter as disclosed herein. A spacing, cross section, and general dimensions of the dielectric bodies of a surface structure array can be adjusted to achieve different filter characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention involves providing a guided-mode surface structure optical filter capable of reflecting a narrow range of light wavelengths out of a broad spectrum of incident light. The center or peak wavelength within a narrow range of reflected wavelengths can shift in response to the accumulation of material deposited on the surface of the filter. Such an optical device can be operated as a sensor in which a linear displacement of the peak reflected wavelength indicates the thickness of the deposited material layer. Generally the optical device can be used to detect the presence of any semi-transparent material such as water or solvents, condensates from a vapor, organic material such as proteins, DNA, and bacteria, and chemical pollutants. In one application the optical device is a guided-mode surface structure filter with depressions or bodies repeated over the surface of a substrate in a linear or two-dimensional array. One embodiment of the optical device includes the polarization independent honeycomb arrangement of dielectric bodies as discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention involves providing a highly sensitive detection method for biotechnology and chemical analysis that does not require the use of fluorescent chemical tags. Such a method can be realized using an optical resonance phenomenon such as the highly complex surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Using a surface structure resonance phenomena, the optical filters described herein can be used to yield sensors with high sensitivity, capable of detecting minute concentrations of chemicals based on a shift in the wavelength of light resonated from the sensor&apos;s surface.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A description of preferred embodiments of the invention follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating an example of preferred operational characteristics of optical filter devices designed for use in the telecommunication industry. As shown, both 100 Ghz and 50 Ghz filters pass wavelengths centered around 1550 nm (nanometers). Preferably, there is little or no loss of an optical input signal for a range of wavelengths around the center wavelength, near 1550 nm in this example. Such a filter function is known in the art as a &ldquo;flat top&rdquo; profile. One reason for the desirability of a &ldquo;flat top&rdquo; filter response is to provide enough margin for variation of a laser transmitting at a specified carrier frequency such as 1550 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an optical device according to certain principles of the present invention. As shown, incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> potentially includes a broad range of wavelengths that are either reflected or transmitted by optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. A distinctive feature of device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is resonant cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> formed by two substantially parallel surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> described in more detail below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> are separated by spacers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and supported by substrates <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which can be wedged (include non-parallel surfaces) to keep light reflected from external surfaces from entering resonant cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, standard parallel surface substrates can be used when they are treated with an anti-reflecting surface texture such as the structure known as &ldquo;motheye&rdquo; in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Because the spacings and dimensions of the features comprising textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> (for example a single step change in depth) are less than the range of wavelengths <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> striking the device, no energy is lost to free-space propagating, higher order diffracted beams. Such textures are known as &ldquo;sub-wavelength&rdquo; in the art, and device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> would be described as a &ldquo;zero-order&rdquo; device by those skilled in the art. Because of the sub-wavelength nature of surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, a portion of the incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> passes through device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> unaffected, continuing to propagate as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. However, for a particular composition and configuration of surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, a range of wavelengths comprising incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will resonate within the wave guiding textures and within the cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, producing reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> propagating at an angle equal to the angle at which incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> strikes device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (in this example at zero degrees, or perpendicular to the plane containing the textures). When resonant cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is filled with an electro-optic material, or when the surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> are composed of an electro-optic material, the range of wavelengths which are trapped within the wave guiding surface textures <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, can be dynamically varied by applying the requisite electric potential <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, between electrically conductive layers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, via electrical leads <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and controller <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a more detailed cross-sectional view of an optical device according to certain principles of the present invention. During operation, a portion of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be redirected from optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> while a portion of incident light can pass through optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Thus, optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be used as an optical filter to transmit or redirect light. This is particularly advantageous in communication systems in which WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) techniques are utilized to pass incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of a selected wavelength to a selected fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown, optical filtering can be achieved by positioning a first substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a second substrate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> with respect to each other. For example, surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> coupled to respective substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can be angled or positioned substantially parallel to each other based on an orientation of the first and second substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Typically, first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> are spaced at a distance between 3.0 and 6.0&mgr;m (micrometers) apart. However, this gap may be smaller or larger depending on the application. Structural support to maintain gap, G, is provided by spacers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> can be a film or layer of material that is deposited on substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> or electrodes layer <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. Specific textures can be formed via an etch process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> Liftoff process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> or an embossing process, all of which are known in the art. Also, surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> can be formed in substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In one application, there is no gap between surface textures so that a combination of first and second surface textures appear as a single plate. Of course, a single surface texture can be used instead of two surface textures in such an application. Also, surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> including depressions, holes, or columns, can line up with each other or be offset relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> can be fabricated on a substrate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> using interference lithography techniques, embossing, etching, optical lithography, e-beam lithography, or other standard techniques used within the semiconductor or related industry. For example, a surface texture can be formed via a recording layer typically composed of a photosensitive medium known as photoresist <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A surface pattern is then formed by transferring or copying into another thin film layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> typically absorb little or no optical energy and can be formed from materials such as zinc sulfide, zinc selenide, silicon nitride, titanium oxide, tantalum pentoxide, aluminum oxide, or other suitable material. For tunable devices described herein, an underlying dielectric layer, the device substrate, an over-coated dielectric layer, or the surface texture can be made of a conductive material such as indium oxide, indium tin oxide, tin oxide, or vanadium oxide to allow the requisite electric field to be applied. These materials tend to exhibit low absorption. Suitable substrate materials can include silicon, indium phosphide, gallium arsenide, germanium, zinc sulfide, zinc selenide, and any non-absorbing glass such as fused silica, quartz, or BK7. Other suitable materials can be used in lieu of these materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Any suitable dielectric material <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can be disposed in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> between first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. Dielectric material <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can also surround individual features <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> comprising surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. In a tunable filter application, cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is filled with a material <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> with an index of refraction that changes depending on an applied condition such as an applied electrical field or temperature change. For example, an electro-optic material such as liquid crystal, polymer-dispersed liquid crystal, lithium niobate (LiNOb3), or polymeric materials having a variable index of refraction whose characteristics change depending on an applied electric field, can be disposed in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the surface structures themselves can be formed of an electro-optic material having an adjustable index of refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To create an electric field in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a voltage can be applied across first electrode plate <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and second electrode plate <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> via voltage source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> drives voltage source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to select an electric field strength and, therefore, select the index of refraction of material in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. A conductive coating is optionally applied to a surface (on an inside wall or surface of cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>) such as first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> to form electrodes across which a voltage is applied to create an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a specific application, the index of refraction of material disposed in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> varies between 1.45 and 1.75 depending on the applied electric field. However, any suitable material providing a range of indices of refraction can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> can be filled with material <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> having a fixed index of refraction. For example, cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> can be filled with material such as air, plastic or other dielectric material. In this instance, optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can operate as a fixed filter rather than a tunable filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the material in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> supports a range of indices of refraction, optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be used as a tunable filter for selecting which wavelengths of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such as &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n are redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and which wavelengths pass as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> such as &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, _, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> typically absorbs little, if any, light energy so that incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is not needlessly attenuated as it either passes through or is reflected by optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. When optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> employs liquid crystal to tune wavelengths of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, low polarization sensitivity can be achieved by either operating on separate orthogonal polarization states, or by the method of exploiting a polarization independent liquid crystal mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the index of refraction in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is selected so that &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reflected from optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> while &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, _, X<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n pass through optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. As discussed, it is preferred that light energy is minimally attenuated. This can be achieved at least in part since optical filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is not polarization dependent. Specific non-absorbing dielectric material (described below) can be used in the fabrication of the optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> so that minimal light energy is absorbed during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Dielectric bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> guide wavelengths of light across a gap between the substrates which form a resonant-like cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. During operation, incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> initially passes through transparent substrate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to the core optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the light between substrates is generally guided by bodies or holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> itself so that a portion of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is resonantly reflected in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and is redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> while a portion of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> passes through optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Generally, operational characteristics of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> depend on a combination of factors such as the index of refraction of the material in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the index of refraction and arrangement of the bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> comprising first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, and the shape, size and spacing between the bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the surface textures. All of these parameters can be adjusted to select which wavelengths of light are transmitted through optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. In addition, the thickness and composition of material layers <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> adjacent to surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, can also be varied to select which wavelengths of light are filtered by optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Material layers <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> can be designed to increase the width of the &ldquo;flat-top&rdquo; (low-loss pass band) by varying their composition or thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> First substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and second substrate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can be formed of transparent non-absorbing material such as glass, which provides structural support for first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. In the application as shown, substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can have an index of refraction in the range near 1.45 to 1.55 while the bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> such as holes or columns have an index of refraction between 1.7 and 2.2. These values can also vary outside the ranges depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As discussed, operational characteristics of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> depend at least in part on the surface pattern of first and second surface textures, <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an overhead view of device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> detailing surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. As shown, a surface texture can include an array of cylindrical bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, each of which has an index of refraction between 1.7 and 2.2. The index of refraction of this material can be any suitable value inside or outside of this range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from a solid block, slab, film or layer of material in which cylindrical holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are formed. A scanning electron microscope photograph showing a typical perspective view of layer <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, wherein holes <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are used as the surface texture rather than protrusions. Holes <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> can be filled with a fixed or adjustable dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the application as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, holes or cylinders <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are arranged to form a honeycomb pattern having three equal axes <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> intersecting at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> degree angles. Axes <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> indicate the direction of parallel rows of bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and illustrate the symmetry of the hexagonal or honeycomb pattern in a transverse direction to incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Based on use of the honeycomb pattern and its orientation, the state of the optical transverse electric field, known as the polarization of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, need not be oriented along any particular axis. That is, circular patterns <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate locations in which an incident light beam <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be directed towards optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Regardless of a location where incident light strikes a surface of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, the transverse electric field of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> encounters a similar cross-sectional pattern. Accordingly, optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is not necessarily polarization dependent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A notable feature of surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is the polarization independence associated with the symmetry of the honeycomb pattern. As shown, there are three axes along which an incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> propagating in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of the array of bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, will encounter an identical cross section. Because of the circular symmetry created by the relative locations of each body <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> (hole or column) in the array, and because the pattern pitch is identical on each of three axes spaced 120 degrees apart, ensuing resonance of light energy in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is unaffected by the orientation of the electric field, i.e., polarization of the incident light. This polarization independence is unique to this type of hexagonal or honeycomb grating structure, and can be beneficial for use in telecom and sensor applications. Notice also that a honeycomb array according to the principles of the present invention has a high degree of circular symmetry regardless of where an optical beam is incident to the array, as indicated by circles <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. (Perfect circular symmetry would be a series of concentric rings&mdash;but these rings have a well defined center and so are not practical for a telecom device which can have an optical beam incident off the center) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a specific application, optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is used to redirect wavelengths, &lgr;, in the L-band between 1.570 and 1.605 micrometers. The height, h, of the surface textures is in the range of 1 to 1.1 micrometers, while the spacing between dielectric bodies in the surface textures, &Lgr;, is in the range of 0.9 to 1.1 micrometers, and the cross sectional width of the dielectric bodies, w, is in the range between 0.5 <highlight><bold>7635</bold></highlight> to 0.7 micrometers. Based on these parameters, a duty cycle or ratio of w to &Lgr; is 60%. Relative dimensions of the optical structure are generally small compared to a bandwidth of light upon which optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> operates. For example, any or all of these dimensions as previously mentioned can be smaller than a wavelength of light that is tuned as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Parameters such as the size and spacing between surface structures can be adjusted to tune wavelengths in other bands such as the telecommunications S-band (1480-1520 nanometer), C-band (1520-1570 nanometer), or cable television bands (800-900 nanometer), or any other range of wavelengths. The period of the structures is directly related to the resonant wavelength; increasing the height of the structures generally shifts the resonant wavelength to longer wavelengths. Duty cycle variations of the structures can also be used to fine tune the resonant wavelength. These parameters also impact the shape of the resonance &mdash;e.g., how wide the flat-top is and the amount of cross-talk(energy outside the pass band). Thus, theoretical models and product parameter variation are used to simultaneously develop products with wide pass-bands at the desired wavelength, along with good isolation characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a top view of an alternate surface texture according to certain principles of the present invention. As shown, a pitch, or spacing between holes or cylinders <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> comprising a single surface texture such as <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, can be varied to provide a flat top filter response around a selected center frequency, without cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. For example, multiple resonances of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> along axes <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight>, can be slightly shifted due to variations in the spacings between dielectric bodies or holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Such asymmetries in the surface pattern of first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and/or a second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, produce an overall output of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> that includes multiple superimposed resonances. A combination of three slightly shifted resonances along 3 axes of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can produce a flat top filter response similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This variation in spacing will lead to a reduction of the circular symmetry needed for polarization independence. An optimized flat top response is produced by minimizing the dielectric body pitch variation in each surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, while effecting a rotation of texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> relative to texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> in a two surface texture embodiment such as device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For the honeycomb patterns illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the maximum rotation between axes in textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is 30 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Producing a flat top response can also be achieved in a two surface texture device by having a slightly different pitch (distance between dielectric bodies) on the first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> than second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Another method for adjusting or broadening a flat top response of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is to change the duty cycle (i.e., the ratio of the width along one axis of the dielectric bodies to the spacing between bodies) in the first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> with respect to the second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. For example, the cylinder bodies shown in surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> can have a larger diameter than the bodies in surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the duty cycle can be varied along separate axes of the same surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, by a change in the cross-section of the dielectric bodies as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The surface texture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> contains an array of square columns <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> surrounded by fill material <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, as opposed to the circular columns <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The square columns in the honeycomb array are equally spaced along axes <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight>, however axis <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> indicates a cross section with a duty cycle smaller than axes <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>. By varying the shape of the dielectric bodies or holes <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the width of the flat top pass band can be optimized while maintaining the circular symmetry <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, needed for polarization independence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Note that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the circular symmetry is greatly reduced for an arrangement of dielectric bodies <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, located at the corners of a square as opposed to the hexagonal grid in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</cross-reference>. Such a square grid pattern can serve to broaden the pass band of the filter but at the expense of a greater polarization dependence. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> where only two axes <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>397</bold></highlight> have equal cross sections, and axis <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> indicates a cross section with a large difference in pitch and duty cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Another method for adjusting or broadening a flat top response is to change the gap, G, between the surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Lastly, the heights h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the dielectric bodies in surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, can be varied to produce a broadening of the filter pass band. Any combination of the variations illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and other methods can be used to adjust the filter response of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Angle tuning can be used to set the desired center wavelength. For example, first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> can be angled relative to second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> (so that the layers are not precisely parallel), or the entire device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be angled relative to the incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> direction. Unique to this technology is the ability to operate the filter at an incidence angle significantly off the normal without an impact on the polarization state (no mode splitting). This technique supports an Add/Drop configuration of wavelengths and eliminates the need for optical circulators to separate counter-propagating incident <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and filtered <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> beams. Potentially infinite isolation can be achieved between Add and Drop channels that are processed by physically separate sections of the device&apos;s aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the results of a simulation of a single guided-mode surface structure resonance filter designed for chemical or biological sensing applications. As shown, a high percentage of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> centered on a 780 nanometer wavelength is redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from just a single surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> at other wavelengths such as above 800 nanometers and less than 775 nanometers mainly passes through optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. As discussed, parameters of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to tune different ranges of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a theoretical pass band filter centered around 1545.5 nanometers according to certain principles of the present invention. As shown, a filter response of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> exhibits an acceptable pass-band width at &minus;0.5 dB loss, and a channel width at &mdash;30 dB below the peak reflection corresponding to a 50 GHz filter for telecommunication applications. In this model, the flat pass band was achieved by modeling a difference in height h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, of the dielectric bodies in the two surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. This serves to de-tune each resonant surface structure such that after modulation by the resonant cavity, two slightly offset center wavelength resonances overlap to form the flat top response. Also in the figure is a plot of a single surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> resonance (curve <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>) without the benefit of the resonant cavity. Such a narrow pass band is unacceptable for some telecommunications applications, but could be useful for some applications such as a wavelength selective mirror for fixed and tunable lasers, for network channel power monitoring, or for test and measurement applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates different characteristics of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> for different indexes of refraction of material disposed in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. As shown, a loss is plotted for a range of wavelengths for a selected index of refraction in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Consequently, dynamic tuning of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be achieved by adjusting or selecting an index of refraction in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Similar results would be found for a model where the optical index of refraction for the cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is held constant and the refractive index of the surface texture is varied. The plot shows three curves n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, n<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> resulting from simulations of three states of device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Curve n<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was generated using device parameters optimized for a resonant wavelength at 1545 nanometers near the center of the telecommunications C-Band. The filter pass band corresponds to a telecom standard of 50 GHz. Curves n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> were generated by increasing and decreasing the refractive index of the material filling cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The center wavelength of the filter shifts more than 15 nanometers for a change in refractive index of less than 0.04. Alternate material groups comprising device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can yield a range of over 100 nanometers for a refractive index change of 0.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the same three curves as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> plotted with high wavelength resolution to illustrate the effect on the filter profile when the device is tuned. By varying the materials employed and the surface texture parameters such as pitch and depth, the filter profile produced with a tunable device can be adjusted to match the application. For example, a tunable filter for WDM network receivers requires a constant filter profile, whereas an Add/Drop multiplexer might require the filter shape to vary significantly to equalize the power in various wavelength ranges, or to add or drop more than one channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In practice a semiconductor material can change its optical index of refraction as a function of electrical current flow, or a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) can be used to form a surface texture with a variable index of refraction. Similarly, a piezoelectric material (that changes shape upon application of voltage) may be used as the surface texture to dynamically tune the device via a change in the pattern duty cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a pass band filter centered around 1531 nanometers according to certain principles of the present invention. Curve A and curve B illustrate the same filter response of an optical device. However, curve A is drawn relative to the scale on the left axis while curve B is drawn relative to the scale on the right axis. As shown, a filter response of optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> exhibits an acceptable pass band width at 0.5 dB, and a channel width at &minus;30 dB below the peak reflection corresponding to a coarse filter for wide-channel-spacing WDM telecommunication applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although one preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a use of two surface textures, namely first surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and second surface texture <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, any number of surface textures can be used in optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. Typically, a higher number of parallel surface textures used in optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> results in a more rectangular filter response. (A single surface texture can also be used. Also, first and second electrodes <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> can be applied along a different axis than shown.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> illustrates optical filter device <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> utilizing three wave guiding surface textures, <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> comprised of multiple dielectric bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> illustrates optical filter device <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight> utilizing four wave guiding surface textures, <highlight><bold>361</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> comprised of multiple dielectric bodies <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference> illustrates optical filter device <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> utilizing four wave guiding surface textures grouped in two resonant cavities <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>B. Three substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> provide support for the four surface textures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The ideal flat top behavior is closely approximated with a resonant cavity as described above, with the coupling surface texture and wave guiding layer on each side of the cavity, where variation in the resonant shape is done by varying the pitches, duty cycles, and thicknesses of the bodies comprising the surface textures. Furthermore, the addition of a third or fourth surface texture improves the flat top behavior significantly, with parameter values exceeding typical specifications as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The reason for this behavior is similar to that of thin film technology, where an improved sidewall slope of the resonance depends directly on the number of cavities in the thin film assembly. In this case the number of surface textures is analogous to the number of cavities. The advantage of the system described here, utilizing multiple surface textures, is the great reduction in the total number of layers in the system in comparison to the typical thin film filter, that utilizes multiple dielectric layers in conjunction with the cavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a graph showing three curves, <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> resulting from a simulation of device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> with a single surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> (curve <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>), device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> with two surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> (curve <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>), and device <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> with four surface textures in two cascaded resonant cavities (curve <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>). A significant increase in the width of the pass band is realized using the multiple surface texture, multiple cavity device <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>. Further increases in pass band width can be obtained with additional cavities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A and 17B</cross-reference> are enlarged top and cross-sectional views, respectively, of surface texture <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> in optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> according to certain principles of the present invention. Liquid crystal material is shown as rods aligned perpendicularly with respect to any surface such as the vertical sides of the cylinder bodies comprising surface textures <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> in cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. This alignment is generally known in the art as homeotropic alignment, a term which typically is applied to devices using flat surfaces with no surface structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Certain advantages can be achieved utilizing such a technique according to the principles of the present invention. For example, this aspect of the present invention involves utilizing a liquid crystal material to adjust the polarization-independent operation of a dynamically tunable optical device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. This can be achieved by adjusting the alignment of liquid crystal molecules or rods <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> so that the molecules align their extraordinary refractive index axis perpendicular to internal surfaces of cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> when no electric field is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A and 17B</cross-reference>, the relative size of rods is exaggerated for illustrative purposes. Typically, the effect of aligning crystalline rods is achieved by a surface treatment involving the rinsing of exposed surface structures such as cylinders <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> with a liquid chemical, such as a carboxylatochromium complex surfactant, as known in the art. When cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is filled, the crystalline rods align perpendicular with the surfaces. For example, rods <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> align perpendicular to outer walls of cylinders <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> while rods <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> align perpendicular to a top surface of cylinder <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Alignment of rods <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> can be replicated within a bulk layer of liquid crystal material by filling cavity <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to form extended rows or columns. This molecular alignment complements the circular symmetry of the polarization independent surface structures as discussed, thus, exhibiting similar polarization independent properties as the honeycomb pattern itself. </paragraph>

The two embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 18C</cross-reference> look the same in their top views, hence <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> is refereed to in both instances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B, a</cross-reference> surface texture can be embossed, etched or formed in layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of optical device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. Although any suitable material can be used to form a surface texture or surface relief pattern, layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> can be a polymer such as UV-cured epoxy, a variety of transparent plastics such as acrylic, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and vinyl, or a glass material such as quartz or fused silica. Other suitable materials can be used to form layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. As previously discussed, honeycomb surface patterns of bodies or holes such as cylindrical shaped textures can be formed in layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The surface texture of layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> can vary depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be coated over layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> using a suitable method such as spin-coating. For example, a surface relief pattern or texture in layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> can be filled or overlaid with another material layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to produce a flat surface onto which layer <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> can be deposited or coated. Layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can include an excess of material over what is necessary to fill the surface texture of layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be a coating of non-absorbing dielectric material such as silicon nitride, zinc sulfide, titanium oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, tantalum pentoxide, or other suitable material. Typically, these materials have an optical index of refraction in the range of 1.8 to 2.4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In a biotechnology application, layer <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> can be a receptor layer such as a receptor chemical or link layer. Layer <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> can then be exposed to other material that chemically binds or deposits onto layer <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, forming top layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. A thickness of material having a specified or measurable index of refraction forming layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> changes the optical characteristics of optical device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. For example, when a range of wavelengths of incident light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (&lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n) interacts with optical device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, a narrow range of wavelengths are redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (&lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), while a remainder of the wavelengths pass through device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> as transmitted light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> (&lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, _, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n). As the thickness of material layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> increases, the range of wavelengths redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is shifted toward longer wavelengths. This change in the peak resonant wavelength can be measured or identified to determine a thickness of layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, optical device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> can be used as a sensor to detect the presence and quantity of certain matter such as proteins, chemicals, molecules, or other matter in a sample solution or substance. In one application, the wavelength of passing light <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> or reflected light <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can be monitored over time to determine a rate at which layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is deposited onto layer <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment for measuring a thickness of a deposited material is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</cross-reference>.

However, the cost associated with manufacturing optical device <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> is generally reduced over the optical device <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>C, layer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is eliminated and a surface texture is embossed, etched or formed in substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The textured surface of the substrate can be any suitable pattern such as those previously discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> deposited on surface texture of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be a conformal coating of non-absorbing dielectric material such as silicon nitride, zinc sulfide, titanium oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, tantalum pentoxide or other suitable material.

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A method for producing layer <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> is vacuum deposition. As shown, layer <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> is deposited evenly on surface texture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Thus, layer <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> itself can form a similar surface texture as that originally formed on the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>737</bold></highlight> such as a receptor layer can be deposited on textured layer <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a range of reflected light depending on thickness of a deposited layer according to certain principles of the present invention. Multiple reflected signals are shown where the peak wavelength of the reflected signal is shifted toward longer wavelengths as the thickness of material comprising layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment corresponding to the graph, the surface texture includes cylindrical shaped columns projecting from a polycarbonate substrate to a height, h<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in a range of 140 to 200 nm (nanometers). Column bodies in the surface texture have a cross-sectional diameter, w, in the range of 240 to 280 nm, and are arranged in a honeycomb pattern. The bodies are spaced in a range between 490 to 530 nm. All of these parameters can vary depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As shown, an optical resonance is identified for a corresponding optical device at a wavelength at or near 805 nm when no material layer such as <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is deposited on corresponding optical devices <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> respectively. As the thickness of the deposited layer increases to <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> Angstroms, a peak reflected wavelength shifts to around 806.2 nanometers. At a thickness of 400 Angstroms, the wavelength of reflected light shifts to around 808.5 nanometers. Generally, the change in wavelength shift relative to a change in thickness is linear within a small range. Layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> are typically formed or made of a non-absorbing dielectric material such as silicon nitride, zinc sulfide, titanium oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, or tantalum pentoxide, all with optical index of refraction values in the range of 1.8 to 2.4. Layers <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are made of non-absorbing materials with a substantially similar refractive index. In general the sensitivity of the sensor as indicated by the magnitude of the shift in the peak wavelength of the reflected light for a given thickness of the material layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is highest when the thickness of material layer <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is minimized. Accordingly, more sensitive optical devices can be produced using thinner coatings for layers <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating sample sensitivity of two embodiments of a guided mode surface structure sensor according to certain principles of the present invention. Each embodiment shows a linear relationship between a peak wavelength shift and thickness of a corresponding deposited material layer. When the thickness of the material layer increases above 1500 Angstroms, the optical sensor devices tend to saturate (i.e., become non-linear). Curves <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>C each provide a different optical sensitivity depending on dimensions of the corresponding optical device. Curve <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>C is preferred in applications requiring a greater change in shifted wavelength for a corresponding given change in thickness. In such applications, less accurate wavelength measurement devices can be used to measure a thickness of deposited material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a double structure sensor in which first and second resonance structures simultaneously produce a static reference signal and a sensor signal (that is used to measure a deposited layer thickness), respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Broadband incident light &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n is directed towards transparent substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Generally, a first resonance surface texture is formed by the interface of textured layer <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> between substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. A second resonance surface texture is formed by the interface of materials including substrate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, layer <highlight><bold>838</bold></highlight>, receptor layer <highlight><bold>837</bold></highlight>, and deposited variable thickness layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. Based on this embodiment, two wavelengths of light are redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>878</bold></highlight> (namely &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), while &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,_, _, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;n pass as transmitted light <highlight><bold>879</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> One wavelength of incident light redirected as reflected light <highlight><bold>878</bold></highlight> can be used as a reference signal while the other light that is resonantly reflected can be used as a signal whose optical wavelength shifts based on a thickness of layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> An advantage of this embodiment is that common mode variations due to temperature and other ambient conditions can be eliminated. In other words, a difference in wavelength between the two resonantly reflected signals (reference and signal) can be used to more accurately determine a thickness of layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In a typical application, a difference in wavelength between &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> increases in response to an increasing thickness of the deposited material layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. Both the &ldquo;reference&rdquo; and &ldquo;signal&rdquo; wavelength shift an equal amount due to temperature changes or other ambient conditions so that the difference in wavelength between signals is generally constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In certain applications, both the reference and signal peak wavelength can vary based on a change in thickness of layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. In such an application, the conversion from a measured difference in wavelength is not necessarily linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating reflected wavelengths of light. Notably, a difference between peak wavelengths changes depending on a thickness of layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. For example, the difference between peak wavelengths increases in response to increased thickness of layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>. The three curves of the graph illustrate change in peak reflected wavelengths for layer <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight> thicknesses of 0 Angstroms, 200 Angstroms and 500 Angstroms, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims. </paragraph>
