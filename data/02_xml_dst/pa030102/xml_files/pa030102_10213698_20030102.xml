<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to transformation of a material from a first state to a second state through the use of an applied energy beam. In one embodiment of the present invention, large grain polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) is formed from amorphous silicon by the superpositioned application of laser beams. Other embodiments of the present invention provide a method for manufacturing thin film transistors (TFTs) utilizing superpositioned laser annealing. Merely by way of example, the invention may be applied to the manufacture of TFTs for flat panel displays such as active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs), field emission displays (FEDs), and organic light emitting diode (O LED) displays. However, it would be recognized that methods in accordance with the present invention have a much broader range of applicability, including the formation of optical sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Fabrication of high quality TFTs on transparent substrates is important for successful application of super-high-definition AMLCD technology. Excimer laser crystallization (ELC) is an efficient technology for obtaining high -performance p-Si TFTs for advanced flat panel display applications. In order to improve both the quality and uniformity of poly-Si TFT performance, the formation of high quality polycrystalline silicon films having carefully controlled grain size and location is often required. Pulsed laser crystallization of amorphous silicon (a-Si) films&mdash;usually effected by nanosecond, ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser radiation&mdash;has emerged as a promising new fabrication method. Laser annealing has been shown to be superior to other crystallization techniques because of its low fabrication cost and high efficiency. In addition, it is a low temperature processing technique because during the fast heating and cooling cycle the bulk substrate material is essentially unaffected, except within a submicron-thick thermal penetration zone adjacent to the heated film. This feature has important practical consequences, since it allows the use of inexpensive large area glass substrates, compared with more expensive quartz substrates capable of withstanding high temperature annealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> ELC can produce grains of hundreds of nanometers in length depending on the a-Si film thickness and the sample preheating. However, the processing window is narrow because large grains can often only be obtained for laser pulse energy densities inducing near-complete melting. In the so-called superlateral growth regime, unmelted silicon particles in the vicinity of the film/substrate interface are thought to act as seeds for crystal growth in the lateral direction (i.e. parallel to the film surface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lateral crystal growth is important for improving electrical properties (e.g. electric field mobility) of the p-Si used by the TFT devices. Since the grains of p-Si are irregularly distributed, grain boundaries may deteriorate the electrical properties, reducing switching speed and increasing power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a simple method and apparatus for easily transforming a layer of material from one state to another, for example from amorphous to polycrystalline, is desirable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to transformation of a material from a first state to a second state, for example from amorphous to polycrystalline, through application of an energy beam. In one specific embodiment, large grain polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) is formed from amorphous silicon by the superpositioned application of laser beams. Embodiments of the present invention relate to large direction- and location-controlled p-Si grain growth utilizing recrystallization from superpositioned laser irradiation. The superpositioned laser irradiation controls cooling and solidification processes that determine the resulting crystal structure. Specifically, a first laser beam of a first pulse duration is used to melt an amorphous silicon (a-Si) film and to create a temperature gradient. After an initial delay, a second laser beam with shorter pulse duration is superpositioned with the first laser beam. When a-Si is irradiated by the second laser beam, the area heated by the first laser beam becomes completely molten. Spontaneous nucleation is initiated in the supercooled liquid-Si when the liquid-Si temperature drops below the nucleation temperature. However, the central part of the liquid pool that is subjected to continued heating by the first laser beam cools down slowly. Grains nucleated in the periphery of the fully molten spot can therefore grow into the liquid-Si and extend in length until they collide at the center of the first laser beam spot. The first laser beam prolongs the molten Si phase and induces grain growth in a certain direction. The second laser beam triggers nucleation and controls grain location leading to subsequent lateral grain growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention for fabricating a film of material comprises the steps of providing a layer of material, the layer of material being substantially of a first state and selected from a conductive material, a semiconductive material, or a dielectric material. A first energy beam is applied to the layer of material at a first time and for a first duration. A second energy beam is applied to the layer of material at a second time and for a second duration, the second time subsequent to the first time and the second duration expiring on or before the first duration, such that the layer of material is converted from the first state to a second state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of an apparatus for forming a film of material in accordance with the present invention comprises a first energy source emitting a first energy beam and a second energy source emitting a second energy beam. A first delivery element is configured to deliver the first beam to a position on an amorphous silicon film for a first duration; and a second delivery element is configured to deliver the second beam to the position after the first beam and for a second duration superpositioned within the first duration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to transformation of a material from one state to another through the use of an applied energy beam. In particular, one embodiment of the present invention relates to large direction- and location-controlled p-Si grain growth utilizing recrystallization from superpositioned laser irradiation. The superpositioned laser irradiation controls cooling and solidification processes that determine the resulting crystal structure. Specifically, in one embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention, a first laser beam of a first pulse duration is used to melt an amorphous silicon (a-Si) film and to create a temperature gradient. After an initial delay, a second laser beam with shorter pulse duration is superpositioned with the first laser beam. When a-Si is irradiated by the second laser beam, the area heated by the first laser beam becomes completely molten. Spontaneous nucleation is initiated in the supercooled liquid-Si when the liquid-Si temperature drops below the nucleation temperature. However, the central part of the liquid pool that is subjected to continued heating by the first laser beam cools down slowly. Grains nucleated in the periphery of the fully molten spot can therefore grow into the liquid-Si and extend in length until they collide at the center of the first laser beam spot. The first laser beam prolongs the molten Si phase and induces grain growth in a certain direction. The second laser beam triggers nucleation and controls grain location leading to subsequent lateral grain growth. </paragraph>

Following a delay A of about 2 ms, at time T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>second laser beam <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is applied to the amorphous silicon. Second laser beam <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> irradiates the sample for a duration B of about 52 ns which expires at time T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

Upon cessation of the excimer laser pulse, peripheral regions <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>outside of elliptical region <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> cool rapidly.

Given the 4 ms pulse duration of the first laser beam as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this delay between firing signal and irradiation can therefore be considered negligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The method and apparatus for crystallizing amorphous silicon in accordance with the present invention offers a number of advantages over existing techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For example, conventional laser annealing of amorphous silicon often relies upon shaping of the laser beam intensity profile via beam masks, interference, or phase shift masks, all of which are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to create. Other conventional approaches to laser annealing utilize patterned islands, antireflective coatings, and sample preheating at elevated temperatures, which also require time and effort and can increase defect rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By contrast, laser annealing in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention utilizes a much simpler, non-intrusive method that simply requires synchronized application of a second laser beam rather than fabrication of any particular mask structure over the amorphous silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of laser annealing in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is a departure from cumbersome and inefficient shaping of large area illumination. Conventional laser annealing techniques suffer from instability in laser energy from pulse-to-pulse, necessitating slow scanning and irradiation over multiple pulses which can give rise to variation in the uniformity and size of the crystals grown. These limitations reduce processing speed and hinder practical integration of conventional laser annealing into a process flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> By contrast, laser annealing in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is relatively insensitive to typical variation in the character of the applied laser beams. This is shown below by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> plots the width of the long polycrystalline silicon grain growth region versus fluence of the excimer laser, with the excimer laser pulse occurring at the midpoint of a 4 ms pulse of an Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> laser having a power of 945 mW. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> shows relatively small change in the major and minor axes of the long crystalline region over a broad range of excimer laser fluences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> plots the width of the long polycrystalline silicon grain growth region versus duration of application of the Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> laser pulse, with an excimer laser pulse of fluence of 200 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>occurring at the midpoint of the pulse of an Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> laser having a power of 930 mW. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> also shows relatively small change in the size of the long crystalline region along the major and minor axes over a variety of durations of Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> laser pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Yet a further advantage of the present method is control over both the length and directionality of crystal growth. Conventional laser annealing techniques do not permit prolonged exposure of the amorphous silicon to the laser beam, resulting in only a relatively brief period of heating and consequently formation of polycrystalline silicon exhibiting only a small grain size. However, formation of large-grained polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention is due to the first modulated beam pulse creating a gradient distribution in the amorphous silicon and that maintains melting. This combination suppresses nucleation and enables prolonged periods of crystal growth to occur, resulting in elongated crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present method also permits control over the directionality of growth of the crystal grains. As described extensively above, crystal growth is initiated at nucleation sites on the periphery of the molten region, followed by extension of the crystal grains toward the center of the molten region. By controlling the position and/or shape of the superpositioned laser beams, and hence the location of the molten region in relation to a target, directionality of crystal grain growth can be controlled. Exercise of control over the directionality of crystal growth, and hence the orientation of grain boundaries, is also discussed further in detail below in conjunction with scanning of the laser beams and/or physical translation of the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Laser annealing in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is suited for a wide variety of applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> One application is in the fabrication of a p-Si TFT. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a plan view of such a TFT device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> comprising source <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> separated by channel <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> of length L. Source <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, drain <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, and channel <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> are formed from a polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> having elongated grains <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>produced by one embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention. Gate <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> overlies channel <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> and is separated from the underlying channel by a gate dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Upon application of a potential difference between source <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, and between gate <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> and source <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, charge can be conducted across channel <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. However, the precise operation of the p-Si TFT device is highly dependent upon the electrical conduction characteristics of the channel region <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Where the channel region is composed of a plurality of smaller crystals, the grain boundaries between the crystals will impede movement of charge carriers across the channel, and the p-Si TFT device will operate at slower switching speeds and require larger applied voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> However, where the channel region is composed of high quality, long grain polycrystalline silicon, charges passing between the source and drain will encounter few, if any, polycrystalline silicon grain boundaries and therefore experience low sheet resistance. The p-Si TFT will thus operate with rapid switching speeds at low applied voltages, with high reliability and with high uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a goal of the present invention to fabricate a p-Si TFT device such that a longer grain crystalline region fabricated by laser annealing of amorphous silicon in accordance with the present invention extends at least the length of the channel. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, wherein single, elongated polycrystalline silicon grains <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extend across entire length L of channel <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, grains <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have an average size of more than 10 &mgr;m, but the invention is not limited to producing grains having these dimensions. Longer or smaller gain sizes are possible, and tailoring of the grain size and hence TFT channel length could permit p-Si TFT devices to be utilized in large scale integration (LSI) circuits that conventionally require the use of MOS or bipolar transistor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As described above, the dimensions of longer grain polycrystalline region <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> are largely dictated by the cross-sectional area of the first applied laser beam. However, where the width of the applied beam is narrower than the projected channel length, it is still possible to fabricate the TFT device utilizing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the laser beams could be scanned for a short distance across the material layer between pulse events. This would create overlapping elongated crystalline regions and further extend the length of the grains. In an alternative embodiment, the sample itself could be physically translated between superpositioned irradiation events to permit growth of crystals of greater length. In such an embodiment, the crystal would grow in a direction opposite the movement of the sample. In yet another alternative approach, the sample and laser beams could each be translated at slightly offset speeds to create elongated polycrystalline silicon grains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Utilizing either stationary or translated samples or beams, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> the direction of boundaries <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of polycrystalline silicon grains <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>could be limited to some maximum angle E (E&lE;45&deg;) from axis F between source <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Various modifications and alterations in the disclosed methods and apparatuses will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For example, while the method and apparatus of present invention is described above in connection with applying superimposed laser beams to opposite sides of a film of amorphous silicon, the present invention is not limited to such an approach. The superpositioned laser beams in accordance with the present invention could be delivered to the same side of a sample, and the method and apparatus would remain within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In addition, while the embodiments described above show formation of polycrystalline silicon from amorphous silicon, the present invention is not limited to annealing this type of amorphous material. Application of superpositioned laser beams could be utilized to transform a variety of materials from one state to another. Materials eligible for transformation in accordance with the present invention include but are not limited to semiconductor materials, dielectric materials, and conductive materials. Specific examples of materials that could be transformed from one state to another include silicon-germanium, indium-antimony, and silicon nitride and silicon oxide films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the embodiments described above utilize laser beams from different sources (Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and KrF excimer lasers) this is not required by the present invention. A method or apparatus for laser annealing could utilize a single laser source having its beam split and the respective parts applied to the sample at different times and for different durations, and the method or apparatus would fall within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In addition, while the embodiments described above depict application of energy from the second laser beam at the midpoint of the duration of exposure of the first laser beam, the present invention is not limited to this timing sequence. Application of the first laser beam to the sample could be timed to expire at the same time as application of the second laser beam, and the method and apparatus would remain within the scope of the present invention. In such an embodiment, maintenance of the temperature gradient and suppression of nucleation leading to elongated crystal growth would be provided by the slower cooling of the higher temperature silicon previously exposed to energy from both the first laser beam and the second laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> And while the embodiments described above utilize pulse durations on the order of milliseconds for the first laser pulse and on the order of nanoseconds for the second laser pulse, this is also not required by the present invention. A method could utilize first and second pulse durations of any length, so long as the pulses are superpositioned and some delay period exists between commencement of the first laser pulse and the second laser pulse. Preferably however, the first pulse duration is at least 100 nanoseconds and the second pulse duration is less than 100 nanoseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to annealing amorphous silicon utilizing laser energy. Energy from sources other than lasers could be applied to melt and recrystallize amorphous material in the manner just described. Such alternative energy sources include but are not limited to electron beams and ion beams. Application of energy from such sources would be timed to melt and then recrystallize the sample material as described extensively above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition, while the above description illustrates application of a first pulse from a CW laser beam having a Gaussian cross-sectional intensity distribution, this is also not required by the present invention. Laser beams having other cross-sectional profiles, such as top hat-like or another beam shape, could also be utilized to fabricate polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In addition, the intensity of the modulated CW laser beam could be variable in time. The rising and falling time of the first beam intensity may be controlled with a precision on the order of nanoseconds. The cooling rate of the liquid silicon, the solidification rate of the liquid silicon, and the duration of melting determine the growth of polycrystalline silicon grains. Therefore, the variation in laser intensity over time is an effective parameter to control the polycrystalline silicon structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the shape of the focused CW laser beam could be spatially modified to promote crystal growth. Thus instead of the cylindrical cross-sectional profile shown above, the CW beam could have a variety of shapes depending upon the requirements of a particular application. In such an embodiment, the shape of the applied beam would in turn determine the shape of the nucleation site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, the method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention could be combined with the use of seed crystals to promote crystallization. A seed crystal could be introduced into the amorphous silicon prior to superpositioned laser annealing in several possible ways. One method of forming a seed crystal would be by solid phase crystallization such as metal-induced crystallization or germanium-induced crystallization. Alternatively, another form of laser recrystallization could be employed. Use of seed crystals would be effective to control location and orientation of the p-Si grains ultimately produced using the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, focused micro-spots from solid state lasers could be used instead of the large spot area excimer laser beam. The use of multiple solid state lasers having smaller beam cross-sections would decrease the cost of the method and increase throughput by reducing dependence upon a single laser source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, delivery of the laser beams to the sample could be accomplished with micro-optics, including MEMS scale devices. Examples of delivery optics structures formed by micro-fabrication processes and available for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, lenses, mirrors, and beam splitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, utilization of multiple and high-repetition beams could dramatically increase the fabrication speed and efficiency in a massively parallel system. Such alternative embodiments would encompass splitting a single beam into a large number of parts applied independently to the substrate, and would permit the irradiation of large areas of substrate more rapidly than with a single beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, beam alignment and on-line probing schemes could be developed and integrated in the process in order to enhance process repeatability, stability, reliability and robustness. Micro-optics including MEMS scale devices can be used for the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Yet still further, while the method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention has been described so far primarily in connection with the formation of a p-Si TFT structure, the present invention is not limited to this application. Superpositioned laser annealing of amorphous material could be employed to create optical memory storage devices, such as DVD disks. In such an embodiment, selective superpositioned laser annealing would create regions of large-grained polycrystalline material representing bits of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Having fully described several embodiments of the present invention, many other equivalent or alternative methods and apparatuses for fabricating long crystal polycrystalline silicon according to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. These alternatives and equivalents are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
