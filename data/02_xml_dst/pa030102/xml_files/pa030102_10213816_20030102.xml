<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus and method for the deposition of thin-film materials used in the fabrication of thin film integrated circuit devices, and thin film devices made according to the method and with the apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of thin film (TF) IC devices, such as thin film transistors (TFTs), a method and apparatus is needed to form the various layers constituting the device. Silicon material, typically amorphous silicon (a-Si) or polysilicon, are used for the active layers of the device and silicon-based insulating layers, typically silicon nitride, SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, or silicon oxide, SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, are typically used as insulators between the active layers. There are several methods to deposit these films. Some methods rely on chemical reactions between one or more suitable gas-phase species to deposit the silicon-based film on the substrate where TF devices are to be fabricated. These reactions require energy, which may be supplied in the form of thermal energy, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma energy, such as plasma-enhanced CVD (PE-CVD), photon energy, such as photo-enhanced, or laser-pyrolysis CVD, or the presence of a catalyst, as in the case of hot-wire CVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Another category of deposition methods are the so-called physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods. In one case, the desired material is deposited by bombarding a suitable &ldquo;target&rdquo; of this material with atoms of sufficient energy, of a typically neutral or inert gas element. This process is called sputtering and is typically accomplished by forming gas plasma in a gap between a target material and the substrate where the material is to be deposited. Argon is the most common gas used in the sputtering industry. Sputtering is a well-suited method for the formation of the various silicon-based, TF device layers because: (1) it is a safe and environmentally benign technique; (2) it may be used at room temperature and is therefore is compatible with any type of substrate; (3) silicon films with very low H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>content may be typically deposited and there is no need for dehydrogenation to release excessive hydrogen, or, hydrogen may be incorporated into the film if, and when, necessary; (4) it is a simpler and more easily scaled method than competitive methods, which rely on chemistry; and (5) it has been successfully used for metal depositions in TF devices, such as TFT-LCDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are, however, some problems associated with silicon sputtering. When Ar, at concentrations of&gt;1 at % (atomic percent), is used as the sputtering gas, capture of Ar by the sputtered film causes structural defects, which lessens the quality of the deposited film. This phenomena reduces the performance of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) TFT device, and also causes difficulties in the crystallization of a-Si, a necessary step in polysilicon TFT technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Intrinsic silicon is a resistive material, which, when combined with sputtering in DC mode, leads to the requirement of a significant voltage drop to maintain a given DC power set point. This problem complicates the design of a power supply, increasing the probability of arcing and increasing the extent of plasma damage on the deposited film due to bombardment by highly energized neutral or charged species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> If He is used as the sputtering gas, to eliminate Ar capture and related issues, the deposition rate of the Si or silicon alloy film is significantly reduced, making it unsuitable for mass production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Silicon deposition by sputtering has not yet reached manufacturing level. As a result, there is no globally accepted solution to these issues. The main concerns are achievement of a reasonable deposition rate, i.e., &gt;10 &angst;/s (angstroms/sec), low Ar content and good plasma characteristics to reduce plasma damage to the deposited films. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The following describes a method of sputtering, or physical vapor deposition (PVD), for deposition of active layers, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si) and polysilicon, and deposition of insulating layers, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>&amp; SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, and an apparatus for practicing the method of the invention. These thin-films are used in the fabrication of thin film devices, such as thin film transistors (TFTs), which are most frequently used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and the invention will be described using TFT construction as an example. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciated that the method and apparatus of the invention may be used to fabricate other types of TF semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The problems associated with thin film deposition have been discussed previously herein. A solution to those problems involves the introduction of an appropriate sputtering gas blend to significantly reduce or eliminate the undesirable effects of Ar, while simultaneously maintaining its merits, particularly the deposition rate. As was mentioned above, use of pure He is not a viable solution to the problems as the deposition rate of He is approximately 3-4 times slower than that of Ar, at a given DC power level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The addition of a small amount of gas to He gas results in a mixyure that behave more like an Ar gas with respect to deposition rate and more like He gas with respect to plasma characteristics, such as voltage. The optimal window appears to be 3% to 10% Ar in He gas, although mixtures in the range of 1% to 15% Ar in the He/Ar mixture appear to be functional. Under these conditions, the concentration of Ar in the silicon film drops below the detection limit of standard Ar measuring methods, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Furthermore, the deposition rate of the silicon film remains at 68% to 77% that of films sputtered by pure Ar. This unexpected behavior is clearly not evident by simple extrapolation of prior art results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The addition of an optional, low-temperature annealing step, after the film deposition, is provided to remove excess He that may have been incorporated in the film during sputtering. He is much easier to remove than Ar by annealing at temperatures in the range of 100&deg; C. to 300&deg; C., by furnace annealing or rapid thermal annealing (RTA), compared to the process for Ar removal, which requires annealing at temperatures in excess of 500&deg; C. This optional low temperature anneal may be applied in both pure silicon and silicon alloy layers, in a-Si and polysilicon TFT applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> He may easily be removed during ELA on the sputtered thin film. If the He-sputtered silicon film is to be laser annealed, the low-temperature annealing step may not be necessary, as laser annealing is thought to be suitable for the simultaneous removal of He and crystallization of the He-free, a-Si film to polysilicon. The optional low temperature annealing step is more appropriate for solid-phase crystallization of the sputtered silicon film by, for example, rapid thermal annealing (RTA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the invention is particularly suited to accomplishing the thin film deposition according to the method of the invention. The apparatus includes a vacuum chamber that is pumped by both a cryogenic pump and a turbomolecular pump. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a PVD chamber constructed according to the invention generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sealed to the outside atmosphere and includes a target <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is held in place by a target carrier <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, of material to be deposited on a substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is held in place on a substrate carrier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A magnetic field is generated by a scanning magnetron <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Heating rods <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are provided to adjust the temperature of chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A sputtering gas feed mechanism provides the sputtering gases from gas sources <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and may be introduced into the chamber independently and mixed in the chamber, or may be introduced through a sputtering gas mixing manifold which mixes the sputtering gases prior to their introduction into the chamber. Plasma <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is generated in the gap between target <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Scanning magnetron <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is used to intensify and confine the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An important feature of chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is its vacuum-producing pumping system, shown generally at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, two pumps are attached to chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In practice, the pumps may be connected to an automated manifold. A cryogenic pump <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used to improve the base pressure and reduce the amount of water vapor in the chamber. A turbomolecular pump <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used during processing when He gas is flown, as the cryogenic pump cannot pump He. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, only a turbomolecular pump is used. The provision of two different types of pumps is based on considerations of improved vacuum quality and faster chamber evacuation in mass production. Because the cryogenic pump is not always in use, its lifetime is extended and its regeneration frequency reduced. Chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of producing pressures during deposition or processing of less than <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mTorr, and as low as 0.5 mTorr. Chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be evacuated to a pressure range of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>Torr. to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>Torr. when no gases are flown in the chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts of the relationship between silicon film deposition rate, process pressure and process gas. In this particular case, all films were deposited at 4 kW and at 400&deg; C. A trace for pure Ar is shown at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for pure He at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and for an Ar/He mixture at <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As expected, the deposition rate decreased as the sputtering pressure increased, under constant power. However, the effect of the process pressure seemed to be more significant for sputtering in argon than in He. This may be explained by considering the frequency of gas phase collisions, as a function of pressure and size of sputtering atoms. At the same pressure, a larger molecule has a higher collision probability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the pressure increases, the interaction between smaller mean free path and higher collision cross-section becomes more important for a larger atom, such as Ar, than a small atom, such as He. Hence, the effect of pressure is more significant for Ar sputtering. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> indicates that He has a higher ignition limit in reference to the ignition limit of Ar, i.e., He plasma will not ignite at pressures below 16 mTorr, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The ignition problem with the He gas may be related to secondary electron ionization phenomena. He is a much smaller atom than Ar; hence, it has a smaller ionization cross-section. In other words, the probability of a collision between an electron and an inert atom, to produce an ionized atom, is reduced in the case of He. This means that, in order to produce a self-sustained glow discharge, a higher density of He atoms is required, which requires a higher operating pressure than that required for Ar. It should be further noted that an interesting intermediate case is obtained when Ar and He are mixed together, as illustrated by line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Not only the deposition rate of the mixture is higher than that of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; He, but the ignition of the mixture tends to follow the characteristics of Ar. The ignition limit of the Ar/He mixture is approximately the same as that of pure Ar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The appropriate pressure range for Si sputtering is determined by the ignition characteristics of the sputtering gas and the deposited film properties. Data from the apparatus and method of the invention is shown by line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, while that from Okamoto et al., supra, is shown by line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that, as the pressure increases, the degree of incorporation of the sputtering gas, Ar in this example, decreases; i.e., a smaller percentage of the sputtering gas is captured in the substrate. This is a desirable property. However, the structural characteristics of the sputtered film also change at higher pressures. The film becomes more porous, and tends to absorb more impurities when it is exposed to the ambient atmosphere. Thus, the electrical performance of the film tends to deteriorate at higher pressures. In addition, the deposition rate of the film decreases. These are not desirable properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A reasonable compromise between the opposing trends exists in the pressure range of 1-15 mTorr for mixtures of He/Ar. Because of the presence of Ar in the mixture, plasma may be ignited at low pressures. Even though reduction of both Ar and He content is achieved at the high-pressure end, the range of 1.0 mTorr. to 10 mTorr may be effective, and the range of 2.5 mTorr. to 10 mTorr. may be preferable from the point of view of film quality and good plasma behavior, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts the deposition rate of silicon at various DC power levels, as a function of the percentage of Ar in the He/Ar sputtering gas. A number of conclusions may be made from these data. The dependency of the deposition rate on the percentage of Ar appears to follow two patterns. In the range of 0% Ar to 25% Ar <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the deposition rate is strongly affected by the percentage of Ar in the sputtering gas mixture; in the range of 25%&plus;Ar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the deposition rate follows a linear relationship with respect to the % Ar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The power level also has a profound effect on this dependency. At low power levels, i.e., 1 kW, line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the initial range is much smoother and, overall, the deposition rate between pure He and pure Ar sputtering is not very different. Power levels are shown for 2 kW, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>; 4 kW, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; 8 kW, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and 10 kW, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Above 2 kW however, the transition from pure He to pure Ar is quite distinct and is associated with a significant increase in the deposition rate. These data indicate that, as far as DC power, the regime of interest is above 2 kW for optimum deposition rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As far as Ar capture, the significant parameters are: (a) percentage of Ar in the gas feed, and (b) sputter pressure. In addition to the Ar content, these parameters also affect the sputter rate, the plasma voltage and the film quality, as pressure affects the film structure. The deposition of silicon with He/Ar mixture was measured at various operating pressures. Two pressure regimes appear to exist: 5-6 mTorr and 16-17 mTorr. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that without any Ar in the mixture, He cannot ignite below 16 mTorr., as shown at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Hence, the only way to deposit silicon with He at a lower pressure is to add a small amount of Ar gas. A small amount of Ar gas in the film is also thought to provide a more rigid silicon network and improve the mechanical properties of the film. According to the literature, Ar, even at concentrations as low as 0.2 at % causes significant retardation to the crystalline growth of silicon. The notation &ldquo;gas % at&rdquo; indicates percentage of a gas in a film, while the notation &ldquo;gas %&rdquo; indicates the percentage of a particular gas in a mixture of gases. It has been speculated that this phenomenon is due to the formation of Ar bubbles in the film. Such formation will affect the physical and electrical properties of the film either in the a-Si phase or in the polycrystalline phase. In the case of alloy deposition, it will affect the silicon bonding network and, hence, the physical and electrical properties of insulating films, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>or SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. Based on these considerations, an appropriate Ar content range, for cases where Ar content source is to be minimized is: 2&middot;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&lt;Ar &lt;2.5&middot;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight> at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, or, 40 ppm&lt;Ar&lt;0.05%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> There are some cases where the retardation of the nucleation and crystalline growth in the silicon film are considered positive effects. One example involves the introduction of a catalyst material, such as nickel, at specified locations into the silicon film, to promote nuclei formation and crystalline growth from these preferred locations. This is achieved by subjecting the silicon film to a thermal annealing cycle, thereby enabling the phase transformation from a-Si to polysilicon at low temperatures via the use of the catalyst. To improve the crystalline quality and its uniformity, it is important to suppress nucleation and crystalline growth in silicon material void of the catalyst. The way to achieve this is to utilize silicon material that is particularly difficult to crystallize without an added catalyst. Such material may be sputtered silicon with a specified Ar content which is high enough to suppress partial solid-phase crystallization of silicon material void of catalyst. Hence, from this point of view we define the appropriate Ar content in the range of: 2&middot;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&lt;Ar&lt;2&middot;10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows examples of the Ar content in silicon films sputtered at different pressure and sputtering gas conditions. The Ar content may be controlled in the ranges identified above, by the deposition pressure and/or the type of sputtering gas. The Ar content in the case of pure Ar sputtering is 6&middot;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and is reduced by more than an order of magnitude in the case of pure He sputtering, 2&middot;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, which is the detection limit of SIMS analysis. When the He/(3.8%)Ar gas mixture is used, the Ar content in the film is only marginally increased, 2-5&middot;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Moreover, this increase may be attributed to noise in the measurement, as the Ar concentration is very close to the detection limit of the measuring technique. Another slight increase in film Ar content occurs with 10% Ar. Incorporation of Ar, then, is not an issue when He/Ar is used as the sputtering gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As previously described, excimer laser anneal (ELA) may be used to convert an a-Si layer to a polysilicon layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the Ar content in sputtered silicon films before and after exposure to excimer laser anneal (ELA) process. Regions of data points are shown for Ar content with pre-anneal and with ELA, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and without ELA, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>; without pre-anneal and with ELA, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and without ELA, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The exposure to ELA, regions <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, results in a reduction in the Ar content in the post-ELA films of more than an order of magnitude, with respect to pre-ELA films. In contrast to ELA, subjecting the films to a thermal anneal at 450&deg; C. for three hours in nitrogen ambient produces no effect at all in the Ar content. Hence, polysilicon films, produced by ELA of PVD amorphous silicon films, tend to contain Ar at a concentration of about 1-2&middot;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>at/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less. Thus, the ELA process is another way to affect the concentration of Ar in PVD-Si films. This is an important feature of the process, because, when the Ar content is required to be initially high to suppress partial crystallization, it may subsequently be reduced by applying ELA process, so that the quality of the film is improved by effectively decreasing its Ar content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the deposition rate, lines <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and measured plasma voltage, lines <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, as functions of the % Ar in the mixture and the sputtering pressure. Notice that in a similar fashion to the deposition rate, the plasma voltage is also strongly affected by the consistency of the sputtering gas. The addition of a small amount of Ar in the He gas increases the plasma voltage, but it clearly remains significantly lower to that corresponding to the case of pure-Ar sputtering. Even with the modest addition of 3.8% Ar in the He gas, the deposition rate is shown to double. Hence, the He/Ar mixture indeed provides an excellent approach to improve film quality, as determined by a decrease the in-film Ar content and reduced plasma voltage requirement, without sacrificing the deposition rate. The 3-10% Ar content regime seems to be the most promising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of the effect of DC power on the deposition rate of various sputtered silicon films. This comparison illustrates the power requirements between silicon films sputtered by pure Ar, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and those sputtered by pure He, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, or by He/Ar mixture, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, to achieve a certain level of deposition rate, or throughput. The slope of each line indicates the deposition rate in each sputtering gas in &angst;/s-kW. Notice that sputtering by pure Ar results in threefold higher deposition rate than sputtering by pure-He: 2.18 &angst;/s-kW versus 0.73 &angst;/s-kW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Notice also that when a modest amount of Ar in added in the He gas, i.e., 3.8% Ar in He, the effect on the deposition rate is quite pronounced. For this modest addition of Ar, a more than twofold increase in the rate is obtained: 1.56 &angst;/s-kW versus 0.73 &angst;/s-kW. Hence, the He/(3.8%)Ar gas behaves more like Ar gas when it comes to deposition rate and more like He gas when it comes to plasma voltage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Moreover, the deposition rate target of 10 &angst;/s is easily attainable with the He/Ar mixture at relatively low DC power levels, 6-7 kW, whereas it requires a DC power level of 13-14 kW for pure He. This non-linear behavior of the He/Ar mixtures is an important property, which has not been identified or suggested in previous works. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To deposit a-Si film, hydrogen gas may be also flown, in addition to He &amp; Ar. To sputter SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, oxygen and/or hydrogen gas may be flown, while for SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, nitrogen and/or hydrogen may be flown, simultaneously with the He/Ar gas. The reduced plasma voltage, afforded by the He sputtering gas, is expected to be very beneficial for the case of dielectric film deposition, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. In this case, plasma damage is typically responsible for the introduction of fixed charges in the insulating films. All of the inert gases, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and Rn, may be used in chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, although, as previously mentioned, Ar is by far the most common gas used in PVD. Lower plasma voltage may reduce the plasma damage and, hence, increase the quality of the dielectric layer. </paragraph>
