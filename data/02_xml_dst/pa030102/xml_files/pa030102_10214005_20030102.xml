<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An endoscopic instrument has a portion having an outer surface with a non-circular cross-sectional shape. The non-circular cross-sectional shape may be provided to the instrument by providing peripheral projections or fins along the length of the portion or by providing the periphery of the portion with a polygonal shape. Where fins are used, the fins are preferably quite small and only have a minimal effect on the fluid flow cross sectional area between the interior of the working channel and the endoscopic instrument. The resulting instrument has significantly reduced backlash while maintaining adequate fluid flow in the working channel. According to a second embodiment of the invention, a portion of the interior of the working channel of the endoscope has an interior surface having a non-circular cross sectional shape by the inclusion of a plurality of radially spaced and inwardly directed ribs or by being polygonally shaped. The resulting endoscope reduces the backlash of an endoscopic instrument inserted therein while maintaining adequate fluid flow in the working channel. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates broadly to surgical instruments. More particularly, this invention relates to an endoscope and endoscopic surgical instruments adapted to be extended into a channel of the endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At the present time there are many instruments made for use in endoscopic medical procedures. Typically, endoscopic instruments are long and flexible cylindrically tubular devices with manually operated handles at their proximal ends and tissue-manipulative cutting, grasping, injecting, or cautery components at their distal ends. Such instruments are introduced into a flexible endoscope which is inserted into the patient through a natural or surgically-created opening. The endoscope includes an elongate portion defining several lumens therethrough and a proximal handle for directing the elongate portion. At least one lumen is provided with an optical imaging system, e.g., a scope, and several lumina or &ldquo;working channels&rdquo; are typically provided for extending endoscopic instruments therethrough. The working channel of the endoscope typically consists of a PTFE-lined cylindrical tube passing from the proximal (handle) end of the endoscope to its distal (working) end. Working channels are typically 2 to 4 millimeters in inside diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> During the medical procedure, the doctor passes one or more endoscopic instruments through the working channels in order to manipulate the tissue being visualized by the optical system of the endoscope. Usually the doctor must repeatedly manipulate the distal end of the instrument by manually pushing and pulling on the proximal portion of the tubular shaft of the endoscopic instrument near where the shaft enters the handle of the endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The view through an endoscope is highly magnified when seen on the video monitors typically used for these procedures; a field of view that may be a few millimeters across would be enlarged to several inches on the video screen. Accordingly, the instrument must be moved very precisely in very small increments in order to approximate and treat the tissue being visualized. In fact, the doctor must position the distal tip of the endoscopic instrument within a fraction of a millimeter of the desired location in order to achieve desired results. However, because of friction and backlash in the way the instrument passes through the endoscope, achieving this level of accuracy is difficult. For example, an endoscope several feet long may be positioned in the colon of a patient with the distal end of the endoscope tightly reflexed to visualize a particular area of the ascending colon. In such a position, the endoscope is bent into a very sinuous shape in multiple planes. Since the outside diameter of the endoscopic instrument is significantly smaller (e.g., 2.2 mm) than the inside diameter of the working channel (e.g., 3.2 mm), a large clearance space exists between the instrument and the channel. When the instrument is pulled back, the tension on the instrument causes the instrument to be pulled taught and the instrument naturally assumes the shortest path through the channel. When the instrument is pushed forward, friction causes it to assume the longest path through the channel (that is, the shaft of the instrument must &ldquo;fill&rdquo; the working channel before the distal end of the instrument begins to move). As a result, quite a bit of backlash (lost motion) is experienced by the doctor when the doctor tries to manipulate the distal end of the instrument. If it is necessary to pull the tip back a bit, the backlash must first be pulled out before the distal end can be retracted. If the doctor pulls the instrument back a little too far, the doctor must then push it several millimeters forward before there is any motion at all at the distal end. During this manipulation, the endoscopic instrument alternately assumes the longest-path and shortest-path positions within the working channel of the endoscope. If this backlash can be reduced or eliminated, the manipulation of the distal end of the endoscopic instrument can be made much easier and more positive, and the doctor can achieve his desired positioning more rapidly. However, this is not a simple problem to overcome for several reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While the backlash situation described above can be reduced or substantially eliminated if the clearance between the outside of the endoscopic instrument and the inside of the working channel of the endoscope can be reduced, this is not a practical solution. It is often necessary to inject fluid (or to operate suction) through the annular space between these two structures. If the instrument shaft were to substantially fill up the space within the working channel, the backlash would be reduced, but there would be greatly reduced ability to conduct fluid through the working channel around the instrument. In fact, because of the nature of fluid flow, as the aspect ratio of the annular clearance space (the ratio of the thickness of the fluid channel to its circumferential length) becomes small, the impedance to fluid flow grows disproportionately to the reduction in cross-sectional area of the fluid passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the diameter of the shaft approaches the inside diameter of the working channel, the area of contact between the instrument and the working channel becomes larger, particularly since the working channel is usually made of a relatively soft material, PTFE. This increase in contact area between these parts results in an increase in frictional drag on the instrument when the doctor attempts to move it through the channel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an endoscopic system with little or no backlash between the endoscope and the endoscopic instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the invention to provide an endoscopic system which reduces the backlash between an endoscopic instrument an a working channel of an endoscope, while maintaining open area therebetween for permitting fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accord with these objects, which will be discussed in detail below, an endoscopic system is provided where either a portion of the endoscopic instrument or a portion of the working channel is provided with a non-circular cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Generally, an endoscopic instrument includes an elongate flexible tubular member having proximal and distal ends, a control member having proximal and distal ends and extending through the tubular member, an end effector assembly coupled to the distal ends of the tubular member and the control member, and a handle means for moving the control member relative to the tubular member to operate the end effector assembly. According to a first embodiment of the invention, the distal end of the elongate flexible tubular member of the endoscopic instrument has an outer surface having a non-circular cross-sectional shape. The noncircular cross-sectional shape may be provided to the portion of the tubular member by radially spacing a plurality of fins or other projections about the peripheral (exterior) of the portion, or by providing the portion with a polygonal cross-sectional shape. Where fins are provided, the fins can be quite small and will only have a minimal effect on the fluid-flow cross-sectional area between the working channel and the endoscopic instrument. Thus, the resulting endoscopic instrument will have significantly reduced backlash while maintaining adequate fluid flow in the working channel. In addition, the fins or corners of the polygonal shape provide few and relatively small contact points so that the endoscopic instrument may be readily advanced through the lumen (working channel) of an endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment of the invention, an endoscope is provided having a proximal handle, and elongate flexible distal portion having an imaging channel provided with an imaging system and a working channel having an interior surface and adapted to receive an endoscopic instrument therethrough. The working channel along its length has a preferably substantial portion at which the working channel has a non-circular cross-sectional shape. The non-circular cross-sectional shape can be provided to the working channel by providing the interior surface of the working channel with a plurality of radially spaced and inwardly directed ribs or other projections or by providing the interior surface of the working channel with a polygonal shape. The ribs can be quite small and will only have a minimal effect on the fluid flow cross sectional area between the working channel and the endoscopic instrument. Therefore, the resulting endoscope will reduce the backlash of an endoscopic instrument inserted therein while maintaining adequate fluid flow in the working channel. Additionally, the endoscopic instrument can be readily advanced through the working channel, as there will be few and relatively small contact points between the two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the provided figures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an endoscopic instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for insertion through a working channel of an endoscope is shown. According to a first embodiment of the invention, the endoscopic instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an actuation handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a tubular coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided about at least a distal portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an end effector assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., a biopsy forceps, and a control wire <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The actuation handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> typically includes a stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a displaceable spool <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a distal throughbore <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a central slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a proximal thumb ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The displaceable spool <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed on the stationary member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and has a cross member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which passes through the slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The proximal end of the control wire <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is coupled to the spool <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Operation of the actuation handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is described fully in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,451 to Bales, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In brief, longitudinal movement of the spool <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> within the slot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> results in operation of the end effector assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; i.e., the end effector assembly moves between open and closed positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in accord with the first embodiment of the invention, the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a low friction coating or sheath, preferably made from PTFE, extending over at least a distal portion of the coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be extruded over the portion of the coil, or may be provided as an attachment capable of being provided over an assembled endoscopic instrument. For example, the jacket may be a tubular member having a longitudinal slit. The jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defines several, e.g., five, longitudinal fins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> radially spaced about the coil. By way of example, and not by limitation, for an endoscopic instrument intended to be inserted into an endoscope having a working channel of 3.2 mm inside diameter, the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably a cylinder 2.2 millimeters in diameter with thin fins (or lands) having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm and extending approximately 0.4 mm out from the coil surface. Such a construction would almost completely fill the diameter of the working channel of the endoscope (i.e., the radial dimension of the jacket, from the center of the coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> out to the end of a fin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is nearly equal to the radius of the working channel), substantially reducing the motion backlash. However, since the fins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are quite thin, only a small amount of the fluid-flow cross sectional area would be sacrificed. Additionally, the number of contact points and surface area of contact points between the fins and the interior of the working channel is substantially minimal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the fins extend along only a distal portion of the endoscopic instrument rather than along the entire length of the endoscopic instrument. If the fins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were to extend to the most proximal portion of the coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it would be difficult to effect a fluid seal against the shaft of the instrument where the coil enters the endoscope handle. Such a seal is needed if fluid is to be injected through the working channel. Since the majority of the flexing of the endoscope in an endoscopic procedure takes place at the distal portion, where the endoscope is situated inside the patient, the majority of motion backlash results from the looseness of the instrument in the distal portion of the endoscope. Accordingly, it is preferable for the fins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be placed on only the corresponding distal portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the endoscopic instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (for example, on the distal 150 cm of a 240 cm instrument) while leaving the proximal portion (i.e., 90 cm) a smooth cylinder. Such an endoscopic instrument would then have greatly reduced motion backlash when manipulated by the physician, and it would allow substantially unimpeded fluid flow through the working channel of the endoscope while providing an easily sealed-upon surface where the instrument exits the endoscope handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, according to an alternate first embodiment of the invention, the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a non-circular cross-sectional shape over the coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the cross-sectional shape is generally polygonal. For example, the jacket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may have a pentagonal shape, as shown. By way of example, and not by limitation, for an endoscopic instrument intended to be inserted into an endoscope having a working channel of 3.2 mm inside diameter, the corners <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the polygon preferably extend approximately 0.4 mm from the coil surface. Such a construction substantially completely fills the diameter of the working channel of the endoscope, substantially reducing the motion backlash, yet only contacts the working channel at the corners <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In addition, space is provided between the sides of the jacket and the working channel for fluid-flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, an endoscope <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to a second embodiment of the invention is shown. The endoscope <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an elongate tubular portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a proximal handle portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> adapted to manipulate and direct the distal end of the tubular portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The tubular portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a plurality of lumens, with one lumen <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> provided for receiving an optical scope or camera device <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (which may be built therein), several lumens <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> provided for receiving control wires <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> extending from the handle portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through the tubular portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and at least one, and preferably several working channels <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> for receiving endoscopic instruments <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> therethrough. For example, endoscopic instruments <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>according to the first embodiment of the invention (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively) may be provided in working channels <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The working channels have proximal openings in the handle portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Other lumens <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may be provided for other purposes. Endoscopes are described in general in U.S. Pat. No. 5,179,935 to Miyagi which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the invention, a portion of at least one of the working channels <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is provided with a non-circular cross-sectional shape. The non-circular cross-sectional shape may be molded into the working channel or more preferably is provided by a low friction, e.g, PTFE, insert <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> preferably fixed within a distal portion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the working channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The insert <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of radially spaced and radially inwardly directed longitudinal ribs <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> can be quite small. For example, the ribs <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may be approximately 0.1 mm thick and have a radial length of approximately 0.5 mm. Therefore, the ribs would have a minimal effect on the fluid flow cross sectional area between the working channel and the endoscopic instrument, and also provide relatively small contact points between the working channel and the endoscopic instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to an alternate second embodiment of the invention, a working channel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is provided with a polygonal cross-sectional shape. The polygonal cross-sectional shape may be provided to the working channel <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> via an insert <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> or may be molded integrally into the working channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In each of the alternate embodiments, the working channel is adapted to provide reduced backlash, while maintaining adequate fluid flow in the working channel around the endoscopic instrument, and minimal contact between the endoscopic instrument and the working channel. In each alternate embodiment, the non-circular cross-sectional shape of the working channel may extend the entire length of the channel or a portion thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> There have been described and illustrated herein several embodiments of an endoscope and endoscopic instrument system having reduced backlash when moving the endoscopic instrument within the working channel of the endoscope. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Thus, while a particular biopsy forceps endoscopic instrument has been disclosed, it will be appreciated that endoscopic instruments having other end effectors, e.g., scissors, punches, needles, etc., can be provided with the non-circular cross-section of the invention as well. Furthermore, while a PTFE has been disclosed for the jacket of the instruments and insert for the endoscope, other low friction materials can be used as well. Also, while a particular number of fins and ribs have been disclosed, it will be appreciated that other numbers of fins and ribs can be used. Alternatively, one or more spiral fins or ribs can be provided. Furthermore, projections other than fins can be used. Moreover, other polygonal shapes may be used for the jacket over the coil and the endoscope insert. Also, the coil and/or jacket may be substituted with another tubular member having a non-circular cross-section. For example, the tubular member may be extruded with a polygonal shape or with fins. It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be made to the provided invention without deviating from its spirit and scope as so claimed. </paragraph>
