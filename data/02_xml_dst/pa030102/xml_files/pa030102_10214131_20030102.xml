<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to an effective therapeutic method for the treatment of hepatitis C. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In chronic hepatitis C, as long as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection continues, liver lesion does not cure and the alleviation is rare. About 40% of chronic hepatitis C patients progress to liver cirrhosis, and further 25% develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Of the liver cirrhosis cases, 75% progress from chronic hepatitis. It is therefore recognized that chronic hepatitis should be actively treated without viewing the prognosis optimistically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) which is a RNA virus causes hepatitis C, IFN-&agr; or interferon-&bgr; (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;IFN-&bgr;&rdquo;) presumably having the action of suppressing the proliferation of HCV may cure chronic hepatitis C. From such theoretical background, an IFN-&agr; therapy for the treatment of non-A non-B chronic hepatitis was reported in 1986 by Hoofnagle et al. (Hoofnagle, J. H., Mullen, K. D., et al.: N. Engl. J. Med., 315, 1575-1578, 1986), and attracted attention. HCV was identified in 1988, and it has been proven that 90% of the non-A non-B chronic hepatitis cases are chronic hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In Japan, various IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; therapeutic methods have been tested since about 1988, and their clinical use was permitted in 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> At present, as IFN-&agr; therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, a method of administering IFN-&agr; three times weekly for a long period of time (Davis, G. L., Balart, L. A.,: N. Engl. J. Med., 321, 1501-1506, 1989) is used in the U.S., Europe and part of Japan, whereas a method of administering a large amount of IFN-&agr; every day for the first 2 to 4 weeks of IFN-&agr; administration (Iino, S., Hino, K., et al.: Gastroent. Jpn., 26(Suppl.3), 224-239, 1991) is employed in Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the former method, the daily dose of IFN-&agr; is 3&tilde;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU in many cases. In such cases, GPT (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) decreases well during the administration of IFN-&agr;, but GPT increases again and HCV-RNA reappears in most cases when the administration of IFN-&agr; is stopped. In recent research, a report shows that administration of IFN-&agr; (3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU) three times weekly for 18 to 24 months makes 24% of the patients continuously HCV-RNA negative, thus enhancing therapeutic effects on chronic hepatitis C, as compared to the 6-month administration whereby the HCV-RNA continuous negative rate is 12.5% (F.D.C Reports, Mar. 31, 1997). Based on the report, the FDA has approved the 12-month administration as a preferable IFN-&agr; administration method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the latter method, i.e., method of administering a large amount of IFN-&agr; every day for the first 2 to 4 weeks of IFN-&agr; administration, a daily IFN-&agr; dose of as high as 10&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU is expected to achieve a continuous normalization of GPT in 40 to 50% of the patients even after the completion of administration and make 30 to 40% of the patients HCV-RNA negative. With such expectation, this method is used in Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In Japan, a method of administering IFN-&bgr; every day for 6 to 8 weeks is also widely used as a therapy for chronic hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As regards IFN-&ggr;, it has been reported that IFN-&ggr; produced no effects when administered to 10 chronic hepatitis C patients for 6 months (F. Saez-Royuela, et al.: Hepatology, 13: 327-331, 1991). Michio Sata et al (International Hepatology Communications 6 (1997) 264-273) reported on the expression of the immunological action of IFN-&ggr;, but the effectiveness has not been officially recognized yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown above, IFN-&agr; therapy and IFN-&bgr; therapy are conventionally used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In recent year, factors determining the therapeutic effects of IFN-&agr; and IFN-&bgr; have been elucidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The background factors affecting IFN-&agr; therapy were analyzed dividing the patients into an IFN-&agr; therapy responsive group whose IFN-&agr; intermittent administration period was less than 2 years and into an IFN-&agr; therapy resistant group whose IFN-&agr; intermittent administration period was 2 years or more. The analysis revealed that HCV genotype, HCV quantity before the treatment and liver image are important. More specifically, the analysis revealed that IFN-&agr; therapy and IFN-&bgr; therapy are effective against chronic hepatitis cases wherein the HCV genotype is 2a or 2b, the HCV amount is less than 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>copies/ml (1 Meq/ml) and the fibrillation is slight, whereas it is less effective against chronic hepatitis cases wherein the HCV genotype is 1a or 1b, the HCV amount is 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>copies/ml (1 Meq/ml) or more and the fibrillation is moderate to severe. Age, sex, contraction period, biochemical test values did not greatly affect IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; therapeutic effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The antiviral action and side effects of IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; are dose-dependent, although there are some individual differences. In IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; therapies, it is therefore expected that an increased dose of IFN enhances antiviral effects and produces high therapeutic effects, whereas undesirable side effects of IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; are worried about. A long-term administration of IFN is better as mentioned above, but causes various side effects, for example, (1) having the possibility that the antibody neutralizes recombinant IFN, (2) inducing autoimmune diseases, (3) producing side effects on the cardiovascular system and (4) inducing or worsening the side effects on patients with depression (Shiro Itano; liver bile pancreas, 21,899-904, 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an effective therapeutic method for treating chronic hepatitis C patients who have not responded to IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; treatment is sought now. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are few research reports on the retreatment cases of IFN-&agr;-ineffective chronic hepatitis C patients using IFN-&agr;. From the reports, however, there appear to be two types of IFN-&agr;-ineffective chronic hepatitis C patients, i.e., the cases in which IFN was ineffective because of an insufficient dosage or short administration period in the first treatment and the cases in which IFN was ineffective despite a sufficient IFN administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Kuroki et al. (Tetsuo Koroki: Medical Practice, 10,981, 1993) administered IFN-&agr; again to 18 out of 71 patients who had not responded to the first IFN-&agr; administration and examined their condition for 1 year or more. Kuroki et al. reported that of the 18 patients, only 1 patient (6%) had continuous normalization of GPT (remarkable efficacy) and there was no continuous HCV-RNA negative case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Matsushima (Takashi Matsushima: Treatment, 77, 1187, 1983) reports the results of re-administration of IFN-&agr; to 37 patients who had been judged as unchanged cases in the first IFN-&agr; administration. The results show that the GPT continuous normalization rate achieved by re-administering IFN-&agr; to 27 patients who had shown transient effects in the first IFN-&agr; administration was 22.2% (6/27 cases), whereas re-administration of IFN-&agr; to 10 patients who had not responded to the first IFN-&agr; administration at all produced no effects (0/10 cases). After all, the GPT continuous normalization rate achieved by re-administration of IFN-&agr; to the unchanged cases was as low as 16.2% (6/37 cases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Hagiwara et al (H. Hagiwara, et al.: Int. Hepatology Communications, 5, 135-142, 1996) reports that as a result of re-administering IFN-&agr; (6 MU) three times weekly for 24 weeks to 29 patients having failed to respond to the first IFN-&agr; administration, 3 patients (10%) had a continuous normalization of GPT and HCV-RNA continuous negative rate was 10% (3/29 cases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to Arakawa et al. (Yasuyuki Arakawa, Hitoshi Okubo: Internal Medicine, 72(5), 873-882, 1993), as a result of retreatment of 19 chronic hepatitis C patients with IFN-&agr;, effective cases were four cases (21%). A comparison of the efficacy of IFN-&agr; re-administration according to HCV-RNA types shows that as regards type 1b, the effective case was only one (6.7%) out of 15 cases, and the other 14 cases (93.3%) were ineffective cases. As for type 2a, the effective cases were 2 out of 3 cases (66.7%) and the ineffective case was one (33.3%). As for type 2b, the effective case was only one. Further, the third IFN-&agr; administration to 3 out of the 14 patients with type 1b hepatitis incurable with the second administration was ineffective in any case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown above, about 80% of the patients having failed to respond to the first IFN-&agr; administration are resistant to the retreatment with IFN-&agr;, and the retreatment is ineffective. Especially, re-administration of IFN-&agr; produces little effects on hepatitis of type 1a or 1b which is considered to be intractable to IFN-&agr;. From the above facts, it can be said that efficacy of IFN-&agr; or IFN-&bgr; therapy against chronic hepatitic C of type 1a or 1b with a large amount of virus is extremely low and there is no method for treating IFN-ineffective cases at present. If chronic hepatitis C is regarded as an infectious disease of the liver by hepatitis C virus (HCV), the target of the treatment is the virus, and treatment for the HCV eradication using IFN-&agr; should be more effective. However, contrary to expectation, a large expectation can not be currently placed on the IFN-&agr; re-administration to IFN-&agr;-ineffective patients, as is clear from the above results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, it is said that the efficacy of IFN-&agr; against chronic hepatitis C is about 30%. Although various IFN-&agr; administration methods are being tried in order to increase the efficacy, a satisfactory therapeutic method has not been established yet. Especially, there is desired the development of an effective therapeutic method for the treatment of IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C, i.e., hepatitis of type 1a or 1b with a virus amount of as high as 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>copies/ml (1 Meq/ml) or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed in view of the above circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide an ameliorant for hepatitis C therapeutic effects, which is used in combination with IFN-&agr; a so as to produce therapeutic effects even on IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C, thus producing high therapeutic effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this specification, IFN-&agr; intractable (chronic) hepatitis C means the case in which at least one of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the HCV genotype is 1a or 1b, (ii) the HCV amount in the patient is as high as 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>copies/ml (1 Meq/ml) or more, and (iii) the fibrillation is moderate to severe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a therapeutic composition for the treatment of hepatitis C comprising IFN-&agr; and the above ameliorant, especially a therapeutic composition for the treatment of IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The hepatitic C therapeutic composition and the ameliorant for hepatitis C therapeutic effects have the effects of alleviating the side effects of conventional IFN-&agr; preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a kit for the treatment of hepatitis C comprising an IFN-&agr; preparation and an IFN-&ggr; preparation, the kit being useful for the treatment of hepatitis C, especially IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a therapeutic method for the treatment of hepatitis C, which has especially high therapeutic effects on IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present inventors carried out intensive research to achieve the above objects and found that when IFN-&agr; is administered to IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C patients after administration of IFN-&ggr;, chronic hepatitis C is alleviated very well. The present inventors further found that similar effects are achieved by administering IFN-&agr; in combination with IFN-&ggr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, it is conventionally known that IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; have antiviral action. As regards the viruses on which a single agent of IFN-&agr; or IFN-&ggr; has antiviral action, combined use of IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; is expected to produce higher antiviral action than a single use of IFN-&agr; or IFN-&ggr; in theory. In reality, however, viruses on which combined use of IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; produces no synergistic or additive effect are reported (C. E. Samuel et al., Virology, 130, 474-484, 1983; AM Di Bisceglie et al, Hepatology, 11(2), 266-270, 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As mentioned already, it has been confirmed by administering IFN-&ggr; to chronic hepatitis C patients that IFN-&ggr; has no antiviral effect on HCV (Yasuyuki Ota, Norio Horuike, Progress of Medicine, 161(5),389-392, 1992; F. Saez-Royuela et al., Hepatology, 13, 327-331, 1991; Michio Sata et al., International Hepatology Communications 6 (1997) 264-273). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is actually unpredictable that combinied use of IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; can effectively alleviate hepatitis C. Especially the following finding in the present invention is surprising: even IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C can be significantly alleviated by combined use of IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr;, preferably by administration of IFN-&ggr; prior to the IFN-&agr; administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed based on the above finding. The present invention includes the following interferon (IFN) preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 1. An ameliorant capable of enhancing the therapeutic effects of IFN-&agr; on hepatitis C, the ameliorant comprising IFN-&ggr; as an active ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 2. A therapeutic composition for the treatment of hepatitis C, which comprises IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; as active ingredients and further contains a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The combined use of the ameliorant of the above item 1 with IFN-&agr; or the use of the hepatitis C therapeutic composition of item 2 produces therapeutic effects on IFN-&agr; intractable hepatitis C which has not been cured with a sufficient amount of IFN-&agr; alone. Therefore, the above ameliorant and hepatitis C therapeutic composition are highly useful for the treatment of IFN-&agr; intractable hepatitic C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 3. a kit for the treatment of hepatitis C comprising an IFN-&agr; preparation and an IFN-&ggr; preparation, the kit being useful for the treatment of hepatitis C, especially IFN-&agr; intractable hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides the following therapeutic methods for the treatment of hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> 4. A therapeutic method for the treatment of hepatitis C, which comprises administering IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; to a subject at the same time or administering IFN-&ggr; before the administration of IFN-&agr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> 5. A therapeutic method for the treatment of hepatitis C which comprises administering IFN-&ggr; to a subject before the administration of IFN-&agr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> These therapeutic methods are especially useful for the treatment of IFN-&agr; intractable hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides the following novel uses of IFN-&ggr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 6. Use of IFN-&ggr; for producing an ameliorant capable of enhancing therapeutic effects of IFN-&agr; on hepatitis C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 7. Use of interferon-&ggr; for producing a therapeutic composition for the treatment of hepatitis C, the composition comprising IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; as active ingredients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The ameliorant for hepatitis C therapeutic effects of the invention is an adjuvant having the action of improving or enhancing the therapeutic effects of IFN-&agr; on hepatitis C and producing therapeutic effects on IFN-&agr; intractable hepatitis C, and comprises IFN-&ggr; as an active ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> IFN-&ggr; used in the invention can be any of those. clinically used and may be of natural type or recombinant type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The ameliorant of the invention is not limited specifically in administration timing, administration route, administration form and dosage, as long as the desired effects are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As regards the administration timing, 1) a method of administering the ameliorant before the administration of IFN-&agr;, and 2) a method of administering the ameliorant simultaneously with the administration of IFN-&agr; can be mentioned. In the method 2), the ameliorant of the invention may also be used by incorporation into the hepatitis C therapeutic composition comprising IFN-&agr; as an active ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferable is a method of administering an IFN-&ggr;-containing ameliorant of the invention before the administration of IFN-&agr;, or a method of administering an IFN-&ggr;-containing ameliorant of the invention simultaneously with the administration of IFN-&agr;. The most preferable is a method of administering the ameliorant of the invention before the administration of IFN-&agr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the case of administering the IFN-&ggr;-containing ameliorant of the invention before the administration of IFN-&agr;, as long as the administration steps of &ldquo;IFN-&ggr; administration&rarr;IFN-&agr; administration&rdquo; are maintained, an IFN-&ggr; pharmaceutical or an IFN-&agr; pharmaceutical may be administered once or several times without limitation, before or after the administration steps.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C patients, i.e., IFN-&agr;-ineffective patients with HCV genotype 1b and a large amount of virus who had failed to respond to the first administration of IFN-&agr; were used as subjects. IFN-&ggr; (1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU/body per dose) was administered to each patient (intramuscular injection) every day for 2 weeks, followed by the administration of IFN-&agr; (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU/body per dose) every day for 2 weeks, and further IFN-&agr; was intermittently administered three times weekly for 22 weeks (this group is thereinafter referred to as &ldquo;IFN-&ggr; combined use treatment group&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As a control treatment group, hepatitis C patients satisfying the similar condition received intramascular injections of only IFN-&agr; (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU/body per dose) according to the same schedule. This group is referred to as &ldquo;IFN-&agr; re-administration treatment group&rdquo;. The results of this group were compared with the cases of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The results show that HCV-RNA negative rate achieved after two weeks of IFN-&agr; administration was 12.5% in the control &ldquo;IFN-&agr; re-administration treatment group&rdquo;, whereas it was 36.4% in the &ldquo;IFN-&ggr; combined use treatment group&rdquo; of the present invention and the remarkable efficacy (HCV-RNA continuous negative rate) was 25.0%. &ldquo;HCV-RNA continuous negative&rdquo; means that the patient was HCV-RNA negative 6 months after the completion of administration. If the patient is HCV-RNA negative 6 months after the administration, the negative state will continue thereafter and hepatitis C is considered to cure completely.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the above results, the administration of IFN-&ggr; prior to the IFN-&agr; administration triplicated the HCV-RNA negative rate, as compared to the single use of IFN-&agr;. Moreover, HCV-RNA continuous negative rate, which was conventionally reported to be extremely low, remarkably increased to 25%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When IFN-&agr; and IFN-&ggr; were separately administered to IFN-&agr; intractable chronic hepatitis C patients at the same time in place of using the above method of administering IFN-&ggr; prior to the IFN-&agr; administration, the HCV-RNA negative rate significantly increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> By contrast, when IFN-&agr; was administered for 24 weeks and thereafter IFN-&ggr; was administered for 2 weeks (14 cases) in place of the above method, HCV-RNA continuous negative rate was 0% (0/14). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It has been reported that when wild type strains having no mutation in the NS5A region (non-structural region) of the gene sequence are dominant in HCV of genotype 1b, therapeutic effects of IFN-&agr; are extremely low, whereas IFN-&agr; produces therapeutic effects when mutant strains (mutant type) having mutation are dominant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> This time, IFN-&agr; (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU) was re-administered every day for 2 weeks to 8 chronic hepatitis C patients with wild-type strain-dominant HCV of genotype 1b, who had failed to respond to the IFN-&agr; administration. No decrease of virus was observed. Further, when IFN-&ggr; was administered every day for 2 weeks, there were cases in which the dominant strain changed from the wild type to the mutant. In such cases, when IFN-&agr; (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>IU) was intermittently administered for 22 weeks, the patients became HCV-negative. </paragraph>
