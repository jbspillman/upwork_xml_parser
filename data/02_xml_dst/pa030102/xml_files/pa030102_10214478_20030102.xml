<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a single-source sputtering process for depositing controlled composition multi-element thin films for use as electroluminescent phosphors. The present invention also provides a phosphor of high luminosity and an emission color that can be tuned by adjusting the film composition. The process entails the use of a source material in the form of a single dense target that has a composition different from the desired film composition of the phosphor. The concentrations of light chemical elements relative to heavier chemical elements in the target composition of the process is higher than desired in the deposited films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, the present invention relates to improving the luminance and emission spectrum of phosphor materials used for full colour ac electroluminescent displays employing thick film dielectric layers with a high dielectric constant. Aspects of the invention also relate to reducing the cost of equipment used to deposit the phosphor materials onto the dielectric layers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A thick film dielectric structure provides for superior resistance to dielectric breakdown as well as a reduced operating voltage in comparison to thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) displays, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,015. The thick film dielectric structure when it is deposited on a ceramic substrate tends to withstand higher processing temperatures than TFEL devices, which are typically fabricated on glass substrates. This increased high temperature tolerance facilitates annealing of phosphor films at higher temperatures to improve their luminosity. However, even with this enhancement, thick film electroluminescent displays have not achieved the phosphor luminance and colour coordinates needed to be fully competitive with cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, particularly with recent trends in CRT specifications to higher luminance and higher colour temperature. Some improvement may also be realized by increasing the operating voltage of the displays, but this increases the power consumption of the displays and decreases the reliability and increases the cost of driving electronics for the displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A high luminosity full colour electroluminescent display requires that the thin film phosphor materials used for the red, green and blue sub-pixels be patterned so that the emission spectrum for each colour of pixel is tailored to minimize the attenuation resulting from the use of optical filters that are needed to achieve the required colour coordinates for each sub-pixel. For relatively low-resolution displays, the required patterning can be achieved by depositing the phosphor materials through a shadow mask. For high-resolution displays, however, the shadow mask technique does not provide adequate accuracy, and photolithographic methods must be employed. Photolithographic techniques, as exemplified in published PCT patent application WO 00/70917 of Wu et al., require the deposition of photoresist films and the etching or lift-off of portions of the phosphor film to provide the required pattern. Deposition and removal of photoresist films and etching and/or lift-off of phosphor films typically requires the use of solvent solutions that contain water or other protic solvents. These solutions may degrade the properties of phosphor materials, such as strontium sulphide that are subject to hydrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, cerium-activated strontium sulphides for blue and manganese-activated zinc sulphides for red and green have been the phosphor materials of choice for full colour electroluminescent displays. The optical emission from these phosphor materials must be passed through an appropriate chromatic filter to achieve the necessary colour coordinates for red, green and blue sub-pixels, resulting in a loss of luminance and energy efficiency. The manganese-activated zinc sulphide phosphor has a relatively high electrical to optical energy conversion efficiency of up to about 10 lumens per watt of input power. The cerium-activated strontium sulphide phosphor has an energy conversion efficiency of 1 lumen per watt, relatively high for blue emission. However, the spectral emission for these phosphors is quite wide, with that for the zinc sulphide-based phosphor material spanning the colour spectrum from green to red and that for the strontium sulphide based material spanning the range from blue to green. This necessitates the use of optical filters. The spectral emission of the cerium-activated strontium sulphide phosphor can be shifted to some degree towards the blue by controlling the deposition conditions and activator concentration, but not to the extent required to eliminate the need for an optical filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Alternate blue phosphor materials having narrower emission spectra tuned to provide the colour coordinates required for blue sub-pixel have been evaluated. These include cerium-activated alkaline earth thiogallate compounds. Such blue phosphor materials tend to give good blue colour coordinates, but have relatively poor luminosity and stability. Since the host materials are ternary compounds, it is relatively difficult to control the stoichiometry of the phosphor films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Europium-activated barium thioaluminate provides excellent blue colour coordinates and higher luminance, but it is also a ternary compound and stoichiometry is difficult to control. Vacuum deposition of phosphor films comprising this material from a single source target using sputtering or electron beam evaporation has not yielded films with high luminosity. Improved luminance of barium thioaluminate phosphors has been achieved by using a hopping electron beam deposition technique to deposit films from two source pellets. The stoichiometry of the deposited film is controlled using the relative dwell time of the electron beam impinging on each of the two source materials. However, this technique is not readily scalable to facilitate commercial production of large area displays and the process cannot be controlled to compensate for changes in the evaporation rates from the two sources as the deposition proceeds and the source pellets are depleted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another approach that has been adopted to improve the stoichiometry of the thioaluminate phosphors is to use more than one source for the deposition, but this approach requires added controls over the relative deposition rates for the different sources. The required relative evaporation rates must be calibrated for each specific piece of deposition equipment and the requirement for multiple sources constrains the design of the deposition equipment, generally adding to the cost of the equipment. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for depositing multi-element thin films for electroluminescent phosphors with a high luminosity and emission color. The process also provides a sputtering means to deposit ternary and other chemically complex phosphor materials to achieve the desired stoichiometry, and to obtain high energy efficiency and high luminosity phosphor films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Phosphor materials that have been successfully deposited to provide high electroluminescence are typically ternary or quaternary compounds, where the ratio of three or four constituent elements must be controlled to close tolerances. If stoichiometry of the compound is not adequately controlled, the phosphor material may show reduced performance and lifetime. In the present invention, stoichiometry control for the sputtering process is effected by adjusting the composition of the sputtering target material to compensate for aspects of the sputtering process that cause the elemental composition of the deposited film to be different from that of the target. Such aspects include differences in sticking coefficients of elements condensing onto the film as well as differential sputtering of elements from the surface of the target. These differences are a function of the specific target materials, the deposited film composition and the substrate material upon which the film is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the target should be relatively rich in light elements, such as magnesium and aluminum, relative to the desired abundance of these elements in the deposited film. For example, to deposit an alkaline earth thioaluminate film with a nominal composition of Mg<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ba<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>w</subscript></highlight>:Eu, the target composition should have a concentration of magnesium and aluminum that is higher than that specified by the nominal composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As exemplified herein, phosphor materials comprising europium activated barium thioaluminate and europium-activated magnesium-barium thioaluminate have been deposited using the method described herein and have shown high luminance and energy efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The preferred substrate is a thick film ceramic material, which is known in the art. In embodiments, the substrate comprises a ceramic sheet, typically alumina, upon which an electrically conductive film, typically gold or a silver alloy, is deposited. A thick film layer consisting of a ferroelectric material and typically comprising one or more of lead magnesium niobate titanate, lead zirconate titanate or barium titanate is deposited on the electrically conductive film. The phosphor film is deposited on the thick film layer followed by an optically transparent but electrically conductive film to form the second electrode for the resultant sub-pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Thin film dielectric layers may be deposited on the thick film layer to mediate undesirable chemical and physical interactions between the deposited phosphor film and the thick and other underlying layers. Thin film dielectric layers may also be deposited on top of the phosphor film prior to deposition of the optically transparent and electrically conductive film. Such further thin film dielectric layers may be comprised of alumina silicon oxynitride, yttria, hafnia zinc sulphide, barium tantalate, barium titanate, tantalum oxide, aluminum titanate, strontium titanate and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further illustrated by the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a cross-section of an electroluminescent device utilizing a phosphor of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a plan view of the electroluminescent device. The electroluminescent device, generally indicated by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, has a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on which is located row electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thick film dielectric <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> thereon. Thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown with three pixel columns, referred to as <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, located thereon. The pixel columns contain phosphors to provide the three basic colours viz. red, green and blue. Pixel column <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has red phosphor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located in contact with thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Another thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is located on red phosphor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and column electrode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located on thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Similarly, pixel column <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has green phosphor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and column electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> thereon. Pixel column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has blue phosphor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with thin film dielectric <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and column electrode <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of deposition of ternary, quaternary and higher compounds, including other chemically complex compositions, especially phosphors, to achieve the desired stoichiometry, and high energy efficiency and high luminosity phosphor films. Phosphors in the form of ternary, quaternary or higher compounds may be deposited to provide high electroluminescence. However, the ratio of the three or four, or more, constituent elements must be controlled to close tolerances. Control of stoichiometry is important in achieving optimum performance of the phosphor. In the present invention, such control is facilitated by varying the composition of the source or target composition, the composition being varied by providing a controlled excess of elements that have a lower atomic weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Phosphor materials comprising europium-activated barium thioaluminate (BaAl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:Eu) and barium magnesium thioaluminates (Ba<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>Mg<highlight><subscript>1-a</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:Eu with 0&lt;a&lt;1) may be deposited using the method described herein and have shown high luminance and energy efficiency. It is believed that the method is also applicable to other ternary, quaternary or higher thioaluminate, thiogallate and thioindate phosphors and composites thereof synthesized with the cation or cations for these compounds selected from Groups IIA and I IB of the Periodic Table of Elements in which the target compositions contains mixtures of elements of different atomic weights. Examples of such cations include barium, calcium, strontium, magnesium, zinc and cadmium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The phosphor compositions may be activated with a variety of dopants, especially europium and cerium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention is believed to be applicable to any ternary, quaternary or higher composition deposited on a substrate. It will be understood that the various source materials would be selected so that a vapour may be created for condensation on the substrate. The preferred substrate is a substrate that is opaque in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In particular, the substrate is a thick film dielectric layer on a ceramic substrate. Examples of such substrates include alumina, and metal ceramic composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the phosphors are europium-activated barium thioaluminates, optionally including magnesium as described above, which are believed to be less susceptible to hydrolysis than cerium-activated strontium sulphide, thus rendering them easier to pattern using photolithographic techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The deposition of the composition may be carried out in an atmosphere of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S, sulphur or other volatile sulphur bearing compounds that will not contaminate the phosphor film as it is deposited if there is a tendency for the deposited compound to be deficient in sulphur. In particular, the deposition is done in a hydrogen sulphide atmosphere so that sputtered species in the film can react with sulphide derived from the hydrogen sulphide to adequately saturate the deposited film with sulphide and achieve the desired film composition. However, in some instances, it may be possible to operate the method without an atmosphere of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for depositing controlled composition multi-element thin films for use as electroluminescent phosphors that can be tuned by adjusting the film composition. Phosphors with a high luminosity and emission colour are obtained. The luminosity and emission spectra of electroluminescent phosphor films may be optimized by controlling and adjusting the elemental composition of the films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides a method of deposition of ternary, quaternary or higher phosphor compositions, especially onto an opaque substrate. The deposition can be done in any contemporary rf magnetron sputtering system, such as those marketed by Edwards, Ulvac and Leybold, that is fitted with a gas injection and exhaust system capable of handling hydrogen sulphide and has a deposition substrate heating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows a range for the target compositions and deposition conditions for typical phosphor films made according to the present invention.

<heading lvl="1">Example I </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A europium-doped magnesium barium thioaluminate phosphor film was formed on a thick film substrate and subsequently annealed at a temperature of about 750&deg; C. for 10 minutes in nitrogen. The thick film substrate comprised a 5 cm by 5 cm by 0.1 cm thick alumina substrate upon which a gold electrode was deposited. A thick film high dielectric constant dielectric layer was then deposited in accordance with the methods exemplified by WO 00/70917. A thin film dielectric consisting of alumina with a thickness of 100-200 nm was deposited on top of the thick film dielectric and the phosphor was sputtered on top of the alumina layer using the sputtering process of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The nominal composition of the sputtering target was Mg<highlight><subscript>.0.67</subscript></highlight>Ba<highlight><subscript>.0.33</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>1.3</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>:Eu where the atomic ratio of europium to barium was 0.03 The target, cylindrical in shape and with a diameter of 3 inches and a thickness of 4 mm, was fabricated using powders of magnesium sulphide, barium sulphide, aluminum sulphide and europium sulphide that had been passed through a 100 mesh screen and then mixed in the appropriate ratios. The mixed powder was placed in a die and pressed at 50,000 psi to compact the powder. The pressed compact was then sintered under nitrogen at a temperature of 900&deg; C. for 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Deposition was done in an argon and hydrogen sulphide atmosphere with a hydrogen sulphide partial pressure of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>torr. The flow ratio of argon to hydrogen sulphide was 1.8. The deposition rate was 59 nanometers per minute onto a substrate at a temperature of 300&deg; C. Following deposition, the phosphor-coated substrate was annealed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700&deg; C. for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a second alumina thin film and an indium tin oxide transparent conductor were deposited to provide a second electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The device fabricated as described above was tested using alternating polarity 36 microsecond wide pulses with a peak voltage of 280 volts and a frequency of 240 Hz. The emission colour was blue. The luminance measured at the voltage of 60 volts above the threshold voltage was 155 to 185 candelas per square metre, the CIE x coordinate was 0.14 and the CIE y coordinate was 0.122 to 0.126. The threshold voltage was 215 to 220 volts. </paragraph>
