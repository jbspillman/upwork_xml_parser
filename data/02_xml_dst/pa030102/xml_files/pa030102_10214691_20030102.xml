<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">There is disclosed a method of fabricating a thin-film transistor having excellent characteristics. Nickel element is held in contact with selected regions of an amorphous silicon film. Then, thermal processing is performed to crystallize the amorphous film. Subsequently, thermal processing is carried out in an oxidizing ambient containing a halogen element to form a thermal oxide film. At this time, the crystallinity is improved. Also, gettering of the nickel element proceeds. This crystalline silicon film consists of crystals grown radially from a number of points. Consequently, the thin-film transistor having excellent characteristics can be obtained. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a thin-film semiconductor having crystallinity and also to a method of fabricating such a thin-film semiconductor. Furthermore, the invention relates to a semiconductor device utilizing such a thin-film semiconductor. In addition, the invention relates to a method of fabricating this semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Techniques for forming a crystalline silicon film on a glass substrate or quartz substrate and fabricating thin-film transistors (TFTs) from this silicon film are known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These TFTs are known as high-temperature polysilicon TFTs or low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> High-temperature polysilicon TFT fabrication is a technique utilizing a heat treatment conducted at relatively high-temperatures such as 800&deg; C., 900&deg; C., and more, in fabricating crystalline silicon films. It can be said that this technique has derived from IC fabrication processes making use of single-crystal silicon wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Of course, quartz substrates withstanding the above-described heating temperatures are used as substrates on which high-temperature polysilicon TFTs are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, low-temperature polysilicon TFTs are fabricated on cheaper glass substrates which are, of course, inferior in heat resistance to quartz substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When a crystalline silicon film forming low-temperature polysilicon TFTs is fabricated, a heat treatment at a temperature lower than 600&deg; C. is used so that the glass substrate can stand up to it, or laser annealing technique which hardly thermally damages the glass substrate is exploited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> High-temperature polysilicon TFT fabrication technology is characterized in that it can integrate TFTs having uniform characteristics on a substrate at a high density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, low-temperature polysilicon TFTs can make use of glass substrates which are cheap and can easily provide large areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that with the current technology, high-temperature polysilicon TFTs do not differ greatly from low-temperature polysilicon TFTs in characteristics. The slight differences between them are that high-temperature polysilicon TFTs are superior in production yield and uniformity of characteristics across the substrate while low-temperature polysilicon TFTs are superior in productivity and production cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With respect to the characteristics, both kinds of TFTs show mobilities of approximately 50 to 100 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/V s and S values of about 200 to 400 mV/dec (V<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&equals;1 V). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These characteristics mean that these TFTs can operate at speeds about two orders of magnitude higher than those of TFTs using amorphous silicon. However, the characteristics of the high-temperature polysilicon TFTs are much inferior to those of MOS transistors using single-crystal silicon wafers. Generally, the S values of MOS transistors employing single-crystal silicon wafers are on the order of 60 to 70 mV/dec. Furthermore, their operating frequencies are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of high- and low-temperature polysilicon TFTS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> At present, TFTs are used to integrate the active matrix circuit of an active matrix liquid crystal display and its peripheral driver circuit on the same substrate. That is, the active matrix circuit and peripheral driver circuit are fabricated from TFTS on the same substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, the source driver circuit of the peripheral driver circuit is required to operate considerably above 10 MHz. Today, however, with respect to a circuit composed of high- and low-temperature polysilicon TFTs, a margin of only several megahertz is given to the operating speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is customary to multiplex the operation, so that a matrix-driven liquid crystal display is fabricated. However, this method has the disadvantage that stripes appear on the viewing screen due to subtle deviations of timing of multiplexing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A conceivable forthcoming technique is to integrate oscillator circuits, D/A converters, A/D converters, and digital circuits for performing various kinds of image processing on the same substrate, in addition to the peripheral driver circuit including a shift register circuit and a buffer circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, it is necessary that the aforementioned oscillator circuits, D/A converters, A/D converters, and digital circuits for performing various kinds of image processing operate at higher frequencies than the peripheral driver circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is substantially impossible to fabricate these circuits from the high- and low-temperature polysilicon TFTs obtained by the current techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that an integrated circuit which consists of MOS transistors using a single-crystal silicon wafer and can be operated above 100 MHz has been put into practical use. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The invention disclosed herein is intended to provide TFTs capable of building a circuit which can be operated at the above-described high speeds (generally, more than tens of megahertz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide TFTs having characteristics comparable to those of MOS transistors fabricated, using a single-crystal silicon wafer. It is a further object of the invention to provide means for fabricating these TFTS. It is a yet other object of the invention to provide a semiconductor device to which requisite functions are imparted by TFTs having such excellent characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device according to the present invention comprises a plurality of TFTs formed on a substrate having an insulating surface. The active layer of the TFTs is formed by a crystalline silicon film. This crystalline silicon film is formed by making use of crystals grown radially from a multiplicity of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This structure is obtained where the TFTS are fabricated, using the crystalline silicon film grown into morphologies shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Examples of substrates having insulating surfaces include glass substrates (which are required to withstand the process temperature), quartz substrates, and semiconductor substrates having insulating films formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The above-described crystalline silicon film consisting of crystals grown radially from a multiplicity of points can be obtained by performing crystallization step, formation of a thermal oxide film, and removal of the thermal oxide film. The aforementioned crystallization is carried out by a heat treatment, using a metallic element (typified by nickel as described later) that promotes crystallization of silicon. The thermal oxide film described above is formed in an oxidizing ambient containing a halogen element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another semiconductor device according to the invention also comprises a plurality of TFTs formed on a substrate having an insulating surface. The active layer of the TFTs is formed by a crystalline silicon film. This crystalline silicon film is composed of a multiplicity of elongated crystalline structures grown in a certain direction. The widths of these crystalline structures range from dimensions comparable to the film thickness to 2000 &angst;. The certain direction differs among the individual TFTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> More specifically, where a number of TFTs are manufactured, using the crystalline silicon film grown into the crystal morphologies shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>, the crystal growth direction (the direction of anisotropy of the elongated structures) in the active layer forming the TFTs differs among the individual TFTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Of course, some TFTs have active layers having the same crystal growth direction but most of the TFTs adopt the above-described structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example, if an active matrix circuit is made of a crystalline silicon film consisting of crystals grown into a morphology as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, numerous TFTs arranged in hundreds of devices x hundreds of devices achieve the above-described structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The crystalline silicon film used in the present invention disclosed herein consists of crystals which are continuous with each other in a certain direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. These successive elongated crystal structures have widths ranging from dimensions comparable to the film thickness to about 2000 &angst;. These numerous crystal structures form regions which extend substantially parallel on opposite sides of grain boundaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Macroscopically, these crystal structures extend radially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A method according to the present invention comprises the steps of: forming an amorphous silicon film on an insulating surface; crystallizing the amorphous silicon film by the action of a metallic element that promotes crystallization of silicon to obtain a crystalline silicon film; performing thermal processing at 800-1100&deg; C. in an oxidizing ambient containing a halogen element to form a first thermal oxide film on a surface of the crystalline silicon film; removing the first thermal oxide film; and forming a second thermal oxide film on the surface of the crystalline silicon film, whereby obtaining a final crystalline silicon film consisting of crystals grown radially from a multiplicity of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the above-described method, in order to improve the quality of the final crystalline silicon film, it is important to make the total thickness of the first and second thermal oxide films greater than the thickness of the final crystalline silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This is because the formed thermal oxide films drastically improve the quality of the crystalline silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Nickel is used quite advantageously as the metallic element for promoting crystallization of silicon in terms of reproducibility and effects. Generally, one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Cu, and Au can be used as this metallic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Where nickel element is employed, the concentration of nickel finally remaining in the silicon film is approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. If the gettering conditions for the thermal oxide films are optimized, the upper limit of this concentration can be reduced to about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The concentration can be measured by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Generally, the lower limit of the nickel concentration is approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. That is, this amount of nickel is left behind because it is normally difficult to remove the effects of nickel adhering to the substrate or equipment if the cost is also taken into account. However, the concentration of the residues can be reduced further by cleaning the equipment to a higher level or improving the manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, where general manufacturing processes are adopted, the concentration of the remaining nickel element is about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> During fabrication of a thermal oxide film, the metallic element moves into the thermal oxide film and so the concentration of nickel element in the direction of thickness of the obtained crystalline silicon film has a gradient or distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Generally, it is observed that the concentration of the metallic element in the crystalline silicon film tends to increase toward the interface at which the thermal oxide film is formed. Furthermore, it is observed that depending on the conditions, the concentration of the metallic element tends to increase toward the substrate or buffer layer, i.e., toward the interface on the back side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Where a halogen element is added to the ambient when a thermal oxide film is formed, this halogen element shows a concentration distribution similar to that of the metallic element. That is, the concentration distribution is such that the concentration increases toward the front surface and/or rear surface of the crystalline silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the final crystalline silicon film according to the present invention is preferably set to 100 to 750 &angst;, more preferably 150 to 450 &angst;. By selecting the film thickness in this way, the crystalline structure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be obtained more clearly and with improved reproducibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is necessary that the thickness of the final crystalline silicon film be determined by taking account of the fact that the film thickness is reduced by the deposition of the thermal oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The crystalline silicon film described herein can be obtained by adopting the manufacturing steps described above. Furthermore, MOS TFTs utilizing the special features of the crystalline structure can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Examples of the method of introducing the metallic element include application of a solution containing this metallic element, a method using a CVD process, methods relying on sputtering or deposition, a plasma processing method using an electrode containing this metal, and a method making use of gas adsorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A method of introducing a halogen element can use a means for adding HCl, HF, HBr, Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Br<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to an oxidizing ambient such as oxygen ambient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the thermal oxide film is fabricated, if hydrogen gas is also introduced into the ambient to make use of the action of wet oxidation, then desirable results arise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The temperature at which the thermal oxide film is grown is quite important. If one attempts to obtain a TFT which can be operated by itself at tens of megahertz or more and shows an S value of less than 100 mV/dec as described later, then it is necessary to set the heating temperature used during the formation of the thermal oxide film above 800&deg; C., more preferably 900&deg; C. or above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The upper limit of this heating temperature should be set to about 1100&deg; C. which is the maximum processing temperature of quartz substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention lies in a technique for crystallizing an amorphous silicon film by means of heating to obtain a crystalline silicon film. This technique is characterized in that thermal processing is performed while holding nickel element in contact with the surface of the amorphous silicon film, thus giving rise to the crystalline silicon film. A thermal oxide film is formed on the surface of this crystalline silicon film by performing thermal processing at 800-1100&deg; C. in an oxidizing ambient containing a halogenic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, a crystalline silicon film grown into the peculiar crystalline state as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be obtained.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment relates to a method of obtaining a crystalline silicon film grown into a peculiar morphology as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, by introducing a metallic element for promoting crystallization of silicon into the whole surface of an amorphous silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The process sequence of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(D). First, a silicon oxide film is formed as a buffer layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on a quartz substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to a thickness of 3000 &angst;. If the surface of this quartz substrate has excellent flatness and is cleaned sufficiently, then this buffer layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At present, it is desired to use the quartz substrate. However, the material of the substrate is not limited to quartz as long as the substrate is capable of withstanding the heating temperature during the thermal processing. For instance, a semiconductor substrate having an oxide film deposited thereon may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Then, an amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> acting as a starting film for a crystalline silicon film is formed to a thickness of 500 &angst; by LPCVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, nickel acetate solution containing 10 ppm (weight-converted value) of nickel element is applied. Then, a spin-drying process is carried out, using a spinner (not shown), to remove a surplus of solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In this way, nickel elements are present as shown by the dotted line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) to obtain a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Among methods of introducing nickel, the above-described method using the solution is excellent in controllability of the introduced amount and reproducibility. However, a metallic element (typified by nickel) for promoting crystallization of silicon may be introduced by a method using a CVD process, sputtering, plasma processing, gas adsorption, or other method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Then, thermal processing is conducted at 600&deg; C. for 8 hours in a nitrogen ambient which contains 3% hydrogen but contains a minimum amount of oxygen. As a result of this thermal processing, crystallization proceeds. Consequently, a crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(B) is derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This thermal processing for crystal growth can be carried out at 450-1100&deg; C. The upper limit of this temperature range is restricted by the heat resistance of the substrate. If some lateral growth distance should be secured, it is desired to set the heating temperature used in the heating processing to 600&deg; C. or above. However, elevating the temperature further does not increase the crystal growth distance and crystallinity so much. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> After the crystallization relying on this heating, laser light irradiation may be performed. That is, the crystallization may be promoted further by laser light irradiation. This irradiation acts to disperse nickel element clusters existing in the film. This will facilitate removing the nickel element later. Even if laser light irradiation is effected at this stage, lateral growth will no longer proceed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The laser light can be emitted by an excimer laser having a wavelength lying in the UV range. For example, a KrF excimer laser (producing a wavelength of 248 nm) or XeCl excimer laser (producing a wavelength of 308 nm) can be exploited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> After the end of the thermal processing for the crystallization, a heat treatment is done at 950&deg; C. in an oxygen ambient containing 3% by volume of HCl. During this step, a thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 200 &angst; on the surface of the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(C)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As a result of the formation of this thermal oxide film, the thickness of the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> decreases by about 100 &angst;. That is, the thickness of the silicon film assumes a value of approximately 400 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> During this step, as the thermal oxide film is formed, silicon element having unstable bonds in the film is used for the formation of the thermal oxide film. Defects in the film decrease, so that better crystallinity can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At the same time, nickel element is gettered out of the film because of the formation of the thermal oxide film and by the action of chlorine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Of course, a relatively high dose of nickel elements gets incorporated into the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> formed by this step. The relative concentration of nickel element within the silicon film <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> After the formation of the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, it is removed. In this way, the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> less doped with nickel element is obtained (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(D)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the crystalline silicon film obtained in this manner, crystals are grown radially from many local regions (many points) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is a photograph of an enlarged image obtained by an optical microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an enlargement of a part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and is a photograph take by a TEM (transmission electron microscope). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this crystalline structure, grain boundaries extend in the direction in which crystals are grown radially. Also, crystalline structures are continuous with each other in this direction. It is confirmed that the continuity of crystal lattices is substantially maintained in this direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an enlargement of a part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and is a photograph of an image observed with a TEM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> pictorially shows the state of crystals grown over the whole film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In this obtained crystalline silicon film, the crystalline structures extend in one direction which is coincident with the crystal growth direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. That is, a plurality of crystalline columns are arranged parallel on opposite sides of grain boundaries extending in one direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> These successive crystalline columns have widths ranging from dimensions comparable to the film thickness to approximately 2000 &angst;. Microscopically, they form regions extending substantially parallel on opposite sides of grain boundaries extending in a certain direction that is substantially coincident with the direction in which the above-described crystalline columns are continuous with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> After the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is removed and the crystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(D) is obtained, a patterning operation is carried out to create a pattern <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> consisting of laterally grown regions. These islands of region <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> will become an active layer for a TFT later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(A), after the formation of the pattern <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 1000 &angst; by plasma CVD. This silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> will act as a gate-insulating film later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> After forming the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a heat treatment is performed at 950&deg; C. in an oxygen ambient containing 3% HCl to form a thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 300 &angst;. This thermal oxide film is formed on the surface of the pattern <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> becoming the active layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As a result of the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the pattern <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> becoming the active layer reaches 250 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> If a TFT of higher performance should be obtained, it is desired that the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> be thicker than the crystalline silicon film forming the active layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In general, it is important that the total thickness of the thermal oxide films <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> be greater than the thickness of the finally obtained active layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> This thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> forms parts of the gate-insulating film. In this way, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(A) is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Then, an aluminum film forming gate electrodes is formed to a thickness of 4000 &angst; by sputtering. This aluminum film contains 0.2% by weight of scandium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The incorporation of the scandium in the aluminum film is intended to suppress generation of hillocks and whiskers at later processing steps. The hillocks and whiskers are needle-like or prickle-like protrusions due to overgrowth of aluminum during heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> After the formation of the aluminum film, a dense anodic oxide film (not shown) is formed. For this purpose, an anodization process is carried out, using ethylene glycol solution containing 3% tartaric acid. The aluminum film is used as an anode, and a cathode of platinum is also employed. In this step, the dense anodic oxide film is formed to a thickness of 100 &angst; on the aluminum film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> This anodic oxide film (not shown) serves to improve the adhesion to a resist mask formed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The thickness of this anodic oxide film can be controlled by the voltage applied during the anodization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Then, the resist mask, indicated by <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, is formed. The aluminum film is patterned into stripes <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, utilizing this resist mask. As a result, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(B) is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Anodization is again effected. During this step, 3% aqueous solution of oxalic acid is used as an electrolytic solution, within this electrolytic solution, the anodization is carried out, using the aluminum pattern <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> as an anode. Consequently, a porous anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(C)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In this step, the anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is formed selectively on the side surface of the aluminum pattern because the resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> adhering well exists thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> This anodic oxide film can be grown to a thickness of several micrometers. In this embodiment, the film thickness is set to 6000 &angst;. The growth distance can be controlled by the anodization time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Then, the resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is removed. Subsequently, another dense anodic oxide film is formed. In particular, anodization is again performed, using an electrolytic solution consisting of the aforementioned ethylene glycol solution containing 3% tartaric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> During this step, the electrolytic solution intrudes into the porous anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and so a dense anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The thickness of this dense anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is set to 1000 &angst;. This film thickness is controlled by the applied voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Then, the exposed silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is etched away. At the same time, the thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is etched by dry etching techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The remaining, CVD-grown silicon oxide film is indicated by <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. A thermal oxide film of the similar shape is left behind under the left silicon oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this way, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(C) is obtained. The porous anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is removed, using mixed acid of acetic, nitric, and phosphoric acids. In this manner, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(D) results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> After obtaining the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(D), dopant ions are implanted. In this embodiment, phosphorus (P) ions are introduced by plasma doping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> During this step, heavily doped regions <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and lightly doped regions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are formed, because the remaining silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> acts as a semi-transparent mask (a semi-blocking mask) and block some of the implanted ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Laser light or other intense light from a lamp is irradiated to activate the dopant ion-implanted regions. In this way, the source region <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, a channel-forming region <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, the drain region <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, and lightly doped regions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are formed by self-aligned technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The region <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is a lightly doped drain (LDD) region (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(D)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Where the thickness of the dense anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is increased to 2000 &angst; or more, this great thickness permits formation of an offset gate region outside the channel-forming region <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Also in the present invention, an offset gate region is formed but its dimensions are small. Hence, the contribution of the offset gate region is small and not shown for simplicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When the dense anodic oxide film is made as thick as 2000 &angst; or more, it is necessary to apply a voltage of more than 200 V. Hence, care must be taken to secure sufficient reproducibility and safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> After obtaining the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(D), a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is formed as an interlayer dielectric film by plasma CVD. Then, a polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is formed by spin coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a contact hole is formed. A source electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and a drain electrode <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are formed. In this way, a TFT shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(E) is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The TFT of the present embodiment shows unparalleled characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> For example, a high-performance NTFT (N-channel TFT) having a mobility of 200 to 300 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/V s and an S value of 75 to 90 mV/dec (VD&equals;1 V) is obtained. Furthermore, a high-performance PTFT (P-channel TFT) having a mobility of 120 to 180 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/V s and an S value of 75 to 100 mV/dec (VD&equals;1 V) is derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Especially, these S values are less than half of those of the conventional high-temperature and low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. That is, these are surprisingly excellent values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Using these TFTs, an operational amplifier, memory circuits, various kinds of arithmetic circuits and amplifiers can be formed on a quartz substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment shows processing steps for fabricating the active matrix circuit portion of an active matrix liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The process sequence of the present embodiment is schematically shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(D). A crystalline silicon film and a liquid crystal display are fabricated by the fabrication steps described in Embodiment 1. A state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(D) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(A)) is obtained by the fabrication steps shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(D) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> After obtaining the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(A), a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is formed as a first interlayer dielectric film to a thickness of 2000 &angst; by plasma CVD. Then, a polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is spincoated. Thus, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(B) is obtained. Polyamide and polyimideamide can be used as resinous materials, as well as polyimide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Then, contact holes extending to the source region <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and to the drain region <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are formed. A source electrode <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and a drain electrode <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are created. These electrodes are fabricated from a Ti&mdash;Al&mdash;Ti lamination film. The source electrode <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is formed so as to extend from a source line (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(C)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Portions of the drain electrode <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are employed as electrodes for forming an auxiliary capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> After forming the source and drain electrodes, a polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is formed as a second interlayer dielectric film. Thus, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(C) is derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Then, a window is formed in the resinous interlayer dielectric film <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. A black matrix (BM) <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is fabricated from a lamination film of titanium and aluminum. Inherently, this black matrix <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> acts as a light-shielding film. Besides, this black matrix serves as electrodes forming auxiliary capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> After forming the black matrix <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is formed as a third interlayer dielectric film. A contact hole that permits access to the drain electrode <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is formed. A pixel electrode pattern <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is formed from ITO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The pattern of the black matrix <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> overlaps the pattern of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> via the polyimide resin film <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, thus forming the auxiliary capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 except that contacts are formed either on gate electrodes or on gate interconnects extending from the gate electrodes by a novel method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In Embodiment 1, the side and top surfaces of the gate electrodes are coated with the dense anodic oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Where the electrodes are fabricated from aluminum, this structure is very effective in suppressing hillocks and shorts between conductive interconnects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> However, the densification of the film makes it relatively difficult to form contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment relates to a structure for solving this problem. The process sequence of the present embodiment is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(E). It is to be noted that like components, including details of fabrication conditions, are indicated by like reference numerals in various figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A), an active layer pattern <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed from a crystalline silicon film. A lamination layer consisting of a thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and a CVD-grown oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the CVD-grown oxide film is first formed, followed by formation of the thermal oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> After obtaining the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A), an aluminum film is formed, and a silicon nitride film is formed to a thickness of 500 &angst;. The laminate is patterned, using a resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. As a result, an aluminum pattern <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and an overlying silicon nitride film pattern <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> are formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> After obtaining the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B), a porous anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is formed while leaving the resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> behind. A denser anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> These anodic oxide films are formed selectively only on the side surfaces of the aluminum pattern <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> becoming gate electrodes, because the top surface of the aluminum pattern is capped with the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> After the formation of the anodic oxide film, the resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is removed. The exposed silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is also removed. The thermal oxide film <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is partially removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In this way, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(C) is obtained. Then, the resist mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is removed, and the porous anodic oxide film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is removed. This results in a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(D). Under this condition, a dopant that imparts a conductivity type is implanted by plasma doping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As a result, a source region <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, lightly doped regions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a channel region <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, and a drain region <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are formed by self-aligned technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> After the dopant doping, laser light irradiation is performed to anneal out the damage caused by the doping and to active the introduced dopant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In this way, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(D) arises. Then, an interlayer dielectric film <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is formed. A contact hole is formed. A source electrode <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, an electrode <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> extending from the gate, and a drain electrode <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are formed. Thus, a state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(E) is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> During this step, the formation of the contact hole extending to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> can be performed relatively easily because no anodic oxide film resides on top of the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Source/drain electrodes and gate electrode are shown to be formed on the same cross section but, in practice, the electrode <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is formed on a part of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> extending from the gate electrode <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is an improvement over the configuration of Embodiment 3. In the present embodiment, a titanium film is grown on the aluminum film forming the gate electrode. A silicon nitride film is formed on the titanium film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In particular, in a configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B), the film <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is made of a lamination film of titanium and silicon nitride. This can suppress generation of hillocks on the top surface of the aluminum electrode in later processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 except that the substrate is made of glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the substrate is made of Corning 1737 glass having a strain point of 667&deg; C. A heat treatment is made at 600&deg; C. for 4 hours for crystallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> A heat treatment for formation of a thermal oxide film is carried out at 640&deg; C. in an oxygen ambient containing 3% by volume of HCl. In this case, the thickness of the thermal oxide film formed reaches about 30 &angst; if the processing time is 2 hours. The resulting effect is smaller compared with the case where a heat treatment at 950&deg; C. is added as in Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 6 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 except that the ambient in which the thermal oxide film is formed does not contain HCl. In this case, the gettering effect of nickel is smaller than in the case where the ambient contains HCl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 7 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 except that laser light irradiation is carried out after the formation of the thermal oxide film. This can promote the crystallization further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> EMBODIMENT 8 </paragraph>
