<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, as a defect inspection apparatus for a semiconductor wafer or the like, an apparatus which picks up an image of a wafer plane by an image pickup section, applies image processing to a picked-up image by a computer in order to extract a defect and records image data subjected to image processing in a storage section has been put into practical use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, in such defect inspection apparatus, since the quantity of data processed in accordance with each image processing becomes very large, there has been considered that an image server having a backup function is connected and an image data file is recorded on the image server side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the method for recording the image data file based on the conventional idea, however, since the image data in the storage section of the defect inspection apparatus is stored in a backup section on the image server side as it is, a large storage capacity is required on the server side, which becomes economically disadvantageous. Furthermore, since management of the image data file stored on the server side is not taken into consideration, there is a problem that the backup data is rarely utilized advantageously. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Embodiments according to the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view showing a schematic structure of an image data file management system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of (a total of four in the illustrated example) inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4) which are client apparatuses perform various kinds of inspections such as a macro inspection, a pattern inspection, a microscopic inspection or an SEM inspection on each stage of a pre-process and a post-process of a semiconductor wafer production line. The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, for example, a defect inspection apparatus or the like which picks up an image of, e.g., a wafer plane by a non-illustrated image pickup section and performs image processing on the picked-up image in order to detect a defective part. The respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4) are arranged in a clean room <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4) are connected to a LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> used for communication. Also, to the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected an image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is arranged outside the clean room <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and retrieves stored content in the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the image data file management system having such a structure, each inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> performs defect inspection processing such as a macro inspection, a pattern inspection, a microscopic inspection or an SEM inspection with respect to a wafer (wafer to be inspected) which is a target of inspection. For example, &num;1 is a macro inspection apparatus, &num;2 is a pattern inspection apparatus, &num;3 is a microscopic inspection apparatus and &num;4 is an SEM inspection apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a procedure of inspection processing on the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) side. At step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) first picks up an image of a surface of the wafer to be inspected by the image pickup section and fetches its macro inspection image data. The image data to be fetched is respective sets data of an interference image and a diffraction image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) detects a defect of the wafer by using respective sets of data of the interference image and the diffraction image at step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and carries out defect judgment processing at step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Then, an inspection result indicating whether the wafer to be inspected is good, namely, whether the wafer to be inspected is acceptable is obtained in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and processing for storing image data according to this result is performed at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Similarly, in the inspection apparatus (&num;2), the microscopic inspection apparatus (&num;3) and the SEM inspection apparatus (&num;4) other than the above inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, judgment of the quality of a defect or inspection of a type of the defect or the like are carried out by enlarging the defect on the wafer to be inspected. Processing for storing micro image data is effected in accordance with this inspection result of the defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At this moment, the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) outputs respective files of interference image data, diffraction image data and inspection result data. Assuming that the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) has a capability of processing up to 380 images per hour, the capacity reaches 1558 MB in one hour since one image corresponds to 4.1 MB when it is not compressed. If this processing is performed 24 hours a day for one month (30 days), the capacity reaches 1121.76 GB. Therefore, when actually storing image data, many hard disks each having a capacity of approximately 1 TB must be prepared, which is disadvantageous in terms of cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the first embodiment, the result storage processing in the respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4) is executed by using a hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of an image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected through a LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, the capacity of the hard disk in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is minimized, and the day-to-day operation and the operation of the data after backup are facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a procedure of the result storage processing at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in detail. At step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) makes judgment upon whether an inspection result is acceptable as judgment on the quality of the wafer. Here, if it is determined as acceptable, the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) performs high compression (which is called nonreversible compression) on macro image data (the interference image and the diffraction image) of the wafer determined as acceptable with, e.g., a compression ratio of 1/20. That is because the wafer image data with the good quality determined as acceptable is rarely referred to later and the reversibility for completely restoring the original image data picked up by the image pickup section of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition, if it is determined as rejectable at step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> performs low compression with a compression ratio of, e.g., 1/2 or non-compression (which is called nonreversible compression) to the image data (interference image and the diffraction image) of the wafer determined as rejectable. That is because the image data of the wafer with the poor quality determined as rejectable is often referred to when analyzing a serious defect which leads to rework or disposal in detail and the reversibility for completely restoring the image data picked up by the image pick up section of the inspection device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is required. Then, at step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) stores the image data of each wafer subjected to compression processing at steps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> in a hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a procedure of compression processing for the image data at steps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. At first, background processing is first carried out at step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. In this background processing, inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> including a wafer stage is created by the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and a wafer portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a background portion (wafer stage) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are separated. Then, in the inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the background portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is replaced with a background portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having a predetermined brightness value (for example, a brightness value 0) by the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1), and inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; is created. The method for separating the wafer portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the background portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be manually or automatically set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) carries out arithmetic operation processing of exclusive OR of the master (reference) image data <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; and obtains a differential image data <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fetches the master image <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which can be such a reference as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> which is previously reversibly compressed and stored in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) subtracts the inspection image data <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; subjected to background processing from the fetched master image data <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and obtains the differential image data <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Then, at step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> compresses the differential image data <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> with a compression ratio set at steps <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Then, at step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores the compressed data in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as illustrated in step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as another method for compressing the image data, there is also one which stores a brightness value with which the master (reference) image is substituted and a standard deviation value with respect to the brightness value of the master image in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in advance, and determines a difference between the master image and the inspection image as a defect and compresses and stores only the difference if the difference is beyond a range of the standard deviation value. According to such a compression and storage method, since it is often the case that the brightness value of the difference between the master image and the inspection image is in the vicinity of 0, the compression efficiency (which is not restricted to JPEG) can be exponentially increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the pattern detection apparatus (&num;2), the microscopic inspection apparatus (&num;3) and the SEM inspection apparatus (&num;4) which use an enlarged image (micro image) for inspection, the micro image data concerning a defect determined as acceptable (no problem) is likewise subjected to high compression, and the micro image data concerning a defect determined as rejectable (having a problem) is subjected to low compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in case of storing the image data from the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the capacity of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be insufficient when a quantity of supplied data increases. As a countermeasure, there is taken a method by which the capacity of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is constantly monitored and the compression ratio in the inspection apparatus is changed or settings of compression and storage are changed by a file system on the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> side when the capacity becomes below a predetermined value. Besides, this is used a method which prepares another hard disk as a spare and a storage place is changed to this hard disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> With the above-described technique, since the image data determined as rejectable (having a problem) as a result of the defect inspection in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored by low compression processing with the compression ratio of approximately 1/2, this image data can be restored as an excellent wafer image which is substantially equivalent to the original image picked up by the image pickup section of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the subsequent defect analysis processing. Further, although the image data determined as acceptable (no problem) is stored by high compression processing, since it is considered that most of wafers are usually determined as acceptable, the LAN load (for example, a communication speed) when transmitting the image data to the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be greatly reduced by applying high compression processing on many sets of such image data to which the complete restoration property is not requested and which are determined as acceptable, and the utilization ratio of the image server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a processing procedure on the server side. Processing on the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> side is executed along the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The image data determined as acceptable or rejectable by the processing in the above-described inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored in the form of a file at a predetermined directory (temporary directory) in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> From this state, at step <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> periodically monitors a temporary directory of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Here, if a file does not exist, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> temporarily stops processing and again repeats monitoring. Furthermore, if a file exists, at step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> classifies (moves) the image data to a directory structure based on a file name of the file in accordance with predetermined rules. If the file has names such as a product class ID, a process ID or a lot ID, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> analyzes the names and extracts each item as information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> looks up in a directory of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> based on the information, and classifies (moves) the file of the image data to a corresponding directory hierarchical structure (under the product class ID, the process ID and the lot ID). Moreover, when there is no corresponding directory, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> creates a directory based on the information and classifies (moves) the file of the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> creates and stores reduced images of the image data in accordance with classification of the directory structure. These reduced images are used for thumb nail display of the inspection image by an instruction from the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by an operator, and previously created in order to facilitate calling. These images are created from corresponding image data by performing thinning-out processing of pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Then, at step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> registers data classified (moved) to the directory structure in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> record relative to the image data in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has respective fields of &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wafer ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lot ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Product class ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Process ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Date&rdquo;, &ldquo;Time&rdquo;, &ldquo;Type of image&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inspection result&rdquo;, &ldquo;Number of times of rework&rdquo;, &ldquo;Elimination flag&rdquo; and &ldquo;Backup medium ID&rdquo;. In this record, information is added and recorded in these fields based on the content of an inspection result in the inspection device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The field of &ldquo;Product class ID&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is associated with each information of &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Product class ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;Product class name&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. The field of &ldquo;Process ID&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is associated with each information of &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Process ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;Process name&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, and the record concerning the process information in accordance with each product class of the wafer is associated with each information of &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Product class ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;Process ID&rdquo;. Information indicating which process is used for processing the wafer of a given product class is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the field of &ldquo;Type of image&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, information indicating which one of the interference image and the diffraction image that the image fetched by the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) corresponds to be inputted. In the field of &ldquo;Inspection result&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, information indicating that the inspection result is acceptable or rejectable is inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As to the field of &ldquo;Number of times of rework&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> number of times of rework is updated every time the wafer in that record is subjected to rework processing (reprocessing). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference> shows a record concerning &ldquo;Number of times of rework&rdquo; in accordance with each lot of the wafer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>D, the field of &ldquo;Number of times of rework&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is associated with &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lot ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Process ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Number of times of rework&rdquo; and &ldquo;Disposal flag&rdquo;. In the field of &ldquo;Disposal flag&rdquo;, data when the image data is subjected to disposal is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the image data of the record is deleted from both the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a backup medium in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, information indicative of this deletion is inputted to the field of &ldquo;Elimination flag&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the image data of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is backed up from the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to a backup medium in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a serial number given to this backup medium is inputted as an ID to the field of &ldquo;Backup medium ID&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</cross-reference> shows a record concerning a backup medium. The field of &ldquo;Backup medium ID&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is associated with &ldquo;Record No.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Backup medium ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;Backup start date&rdquo;, &ldquo;Backup end date&rdquo; and &ldquo;Possibility of recycle&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</cross-reference>. That is, here, the record managing a backup medium is defined, and the field of &ldquo;Possibility of recycle&rdquo; indicates whether all data in the backup medium is completely erased and that medium can be again used. A condition of enabling recycle is that all of &ldquo;Elimination flags&rdquo; having the same backup medium ID in the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Then, at step <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> makes judgment upon whether backup of the lot of the wafer is possible. In this case, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> makes reference to data in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C and 8D</cross-reference>. When the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> completes all the processes with respect to the product class of the wafer concerning that one lot or confirms that disposal is determined in the middle of the process, it advances to step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Also, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> changes the content in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and determines which backup medium is used for backup by filling in &ldquo;Backup medium ID&rdquo; of the record shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Then, at step <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> carries out backup of the corresponding image data file in the had disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the backup medium in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that the image data file which is backed up in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not include reduced images of the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this case, as the backup medium in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a tape or a semiconductor memory is used, and the image data file is backed up together with the directory structure. Further, the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> manages which product class the data of the wafer belongs to and which medium this data is backed up to, and manages the backed-up image data file by imparting an identification code such as a bar code or a serial number. Furthermore, the backed-up image data file is deleted from the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and an identifier such as a serial number is added as an item of the image data file in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> manages which image data file is stored in accordance with each backup medium. When all the files in the medium are deleted, the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> manages in such a manner that this medium can be recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, concrete description will be given as to the relationship between the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. For example, in case of a semiconductor production line which processes 30,000 wafers per month, assuming that all wafers are excellent products, the capacity of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> required for the macro inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) for one month can be expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>30,000 (wafers)&times;4.1 (<highlight><italic>MB</italic></highlight>)&times;2(number of images/wafer)&times;10(number of processes)&times;0.05(compression ratio 1/20)&equals;123 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In addition, assuming that wafers put into the production line one month ago (30 days) are processed in the first-in last-out manner and the delay is up to 15 days in particular, the capacity of the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with the safety being taken into consideration can be estimated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>123(<highlight><italic>GB</italic></highlight>)&times;(1&plus;(15 (days)/30(days)))&equals;184.5(<highlight><italic>GB</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the capacity per day can be expressed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>123(<highlight><italic>GB</italic></highlight>)/30(days)&equals;4.1(<highlight><italic>GB</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After elapse of the first one month, from the next day, data of 4.1 GB is backed up by the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> every day. In this case, if AITs (Advanced Intelligent Tapes) each of which has the capacity of 100 GB are used as backup mediums, using approximately 1.23 tapes (4.1 (GB)&times;30(days)&equals;123(GB)) per month can suffice. Further, presuming that the backup data is stored for one year, preparing approximately 15 tapes (1.23 (tapes)&times;12(months)&equals;14.76) can suffice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can display a list of inspection results in a non-illustrated display section by using reduced images of the image data created in accordance with each classification of the directory structure which is not backed up but remains in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and display in the display section the correspondence relationship between the image data file and the backup medium based on the storage content in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the retrieval or inspection status of the backup medium or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a view showing an example of display of a list of inspection images by the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The display screen of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> has an inspection image display area <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for displaying a list of many aligned reduced images <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to the image data as an inspection result, an area <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for displaying product classes or processes of the overall lots or all strokes, and a directory display area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that records of the image data or data of reduced images which are not required at all are deleted by the periodical maintenance in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Although description has been given as to an example in which the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to a plurality of the inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the above-described embodiment, it is possible to apply a system in which the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in the one-to-one relationship. Furthermore, a system having a function of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be likewise applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a view showing a schematic structure of an image data file management system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, like reference numerals denote parts equal to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to a LAN <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for a line in a factory. The process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> manages a series of processes for manufacturing a wafer in the factory. Further, in the clean room <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4 and others) and the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected to a LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transferring images. Furthermore, the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be configured to be connected to the LAN <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Inherent information of each wafer as an inspection target (inspection processes, product classes or the like) is stored in a recipe area (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4 and others) carry out the macro inspection, the pattern inspection, the microscopic inspection (micro inspection) and the SEM inspection of each wafer. Moreover, to the LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected non-illustrated inspection apparatuses such as an overlap inspection apparatus, a film thickness inspection apparatus or an extraneous material inspection apparatus. The respective inspection devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (1 to &num;4 and others) download the necessary inherent information of each wafer from the recipe area (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and perform inspection in accordance with a created recipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After completion of inspection, the respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4 and others) supply an inspection result file in which an inspection result is added to the inherent information to a temporary directory in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the image server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transferring images. The server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the image server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> monitors the temporary directory in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, converts by using a decoder the inspection result supplied to the temporary directory, registers it in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and stores it in the recipe area (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> after performing history management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> At this moment, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extracts the image data from the converted inspection result and classifies (moves) the image data to a directory structure in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in accordance with predetermined rules. The server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> creates and stores reduced images of the image data in accordance with each classification of the directory structure. Moreover, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can make judgment upon whether a defect detected by a given inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also detected by another inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by comparing information indicative of largeness of the defect which can be obtained based on a coordinate of the defect indicated by the image data in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with a coordinate of the defect indicated by the image data extracted from the inspection result of the inspection result file from another inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

That is, in the enlarged image of the wafer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, there is shown an image of the defect which is the same as the defect shown in the enlarged image of the wafer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> and detected by the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;4). As a result, an operator can observe the image obtained by the microscopic inspection and then observe the image obtained by the SEM inspection with respect to the same defects. Incidentally, if there is no image obtained by the SEM inspection linked to the image of the defect obtained by the microscopic inspection, the image <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is not displayed. Further, in the image information <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, inherent information in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;4) which is a link target is displayed in characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when an operator uses a non-illustrated mouse or keyboard in the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and operates (for example, click operation) to select an encircled number (&ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;5&rdquo;) on the enlarged image of the wafer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the content in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> can be displayed in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Consequently, an operator can observe the image obtained by the pattern inspection and then observe the image obtained by the SEM inspection with respect to the same defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a view showing a modification of display of an image of a wafer which is changed in the order of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> mentioned above. In the display example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, an image obtained by the macro inspection is gradually enlarged in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and it is then changed over to an image obtained by the microscopic inspection. A wafer image <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is the same as the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. When an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) to select an image of a defect indicated by an arrow a in the wafer image <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the wafer image <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> obtained by the macro inspection is enlarged and displayed while mainly focusing on the defect image. Moreover, when an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) to select an enlarged defect image indicated by an arrow b in the wafer image <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, that defect image is further enlarged and displayed as a wafer image <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, when an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) to select an arbitrary part in the wafer image <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, a microscopic image linked to an image of that part is displayed. For example, when an operator manipulates to select a part indicated by an arrow A, a microscopic image <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> linked to an image of that part is displayed. In addition, when an operator manipulates to select a part indicated by an arrow B, nothing is displayed as indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> since there is no microscopic image linked to an image of that part. In this manner, since a part selected by an operator is mainly displayed after switching to the microscopic image <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, nothing is displayed if there is no linked image. Therefore, by displaying a position at which a linked image exists in an emphatic color or the like on the wafer image <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the position at which the linked image exists can be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, a sub image <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> showing the relationship of a display range between an image obtained by the macro inspection and a microscopic image linked to that image is also displayed in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during display of the microscopic image. In the sub image <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, there are displayed a display range <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> of the wafer image <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> immediately before display the microscopic image, a display range <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the linked microscopic image <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and a current display range <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, respectively, in the frames. As a result, an operator can be aware of the relationship of each display range of the image obtained by the macro inspection, the linked microscopic image and the current image, thereby effectively observing the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As described above, by operating to select an image obtained by the macro inspection, a wafer image can be enlarged and displayed while focusing on a selected part, and the image can be gradually enlarged for display up to a predetermined magnification. Additionally, if there is an image obtained by any other inspection apparatus which is linked to a predetermined part in the enlarged image, automatic switching is carried out in order to display that image. For example, switching is performed when the magnification is equal to or greater than that of the image of any other inspection apparatus. As a result, an operator can gradually enlarge and observe a defect in the wafer image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are provided respective buttons <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> used for performing detailed information display of, e.g., the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement and overlay display. In the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement, the inspection concerning the entire wafer is carried out in a similar may to the macro inspection. When the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement is effected, &ldquo;Present&rdquo; is displayed on the left side of a corresponding button <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this state, when an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) the button <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;Detailed information&rdquo;, detailed information of the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement is downloaded from the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> displays the detailed information in characters in a window on the display section. Further, when an operator uses a non-illustrated mouse or keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) the button <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of &ldquo;Overlay&rdquo;, the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> displays the downloaded image data of the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement on the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the overlay manner. As a result, an operator can see the defect image obtained by the macro inspection and the defect image obtained by the overlap inspection or the film thickness measurement simultaneously on the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, thereby observing the state of each defect in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> button <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> used for superposing and displaying defect images in a plurality of processes for manufacturing the wafer on the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is provided in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. When an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) the button <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a window for selecting a product class of the wafer is displayed. When an operator operates to select a plurality of processes having images which must be displayed, image data obtained by respective inspections in these respective processes is downloaded from the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (or the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) to the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> superposes and displays these sets of image data on the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the order of the respective processes with time. It should be noted that if a color of a defect image is changed and displayed in accordance with each process, the state of generation of the defect can be further easily recognized. In this manner, by superposing and displaying defect images in the respective inspection apparatuses in a plurality of processes for manufacturing the wafer in order in accordance with each process, an operator can recognize a process in which the defect is generated, thereby readily grasping a factor of occurrence of the defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) to select an item of any desired one of the inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4 and others) in the inspection result <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the detailed information and the image of the inspection result obtained by that inspection apparatus can be displayed in another window, or the wafer image <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be switched to an image of that inspection apparatus for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in the defect information by any other apparatus <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> displayed in the display section of the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, information of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which can readily detect a target type of defect is displayed in favor. That is, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, as shown in the defect information <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, since a name of the defect is &ldquo;Defocus&rdquo;, the inspection result is display in the order of the inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;PA501&rdquo; and &ldquo;LA505&rdquo;) which can readily detect the defocus. As a result, an operator can see the inspection result or the image in the inspection apparatus which detects a defect which must be observed in favor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In addition, when an operator uses a mouse or a keyboard and operates (for example, click operation) the button <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, re-classification processing is carried out. The server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> makes reference to the records in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and classifies detected defects based on the defect information shown in the inspection result of each inspection apparatus in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, in response to the operation from the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For example, when an extraneous material is detected at an end portion of the wafer by the extraneous material detection apparatus and a streak-like film thickness defect is detected at a part corresponding to that extraneous material by the film thickness inspection apparatus, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> classifies that defect as a comet. Additionally, when an error on the wafer is detected by the macro inspection apparatus and an overlap error is detected by the overlap inspection apparatus, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> classifies that defect as a mask displacement. Further, when an error on the wafer is detected by the macro inspection apparatus and a pattern inspection is detected by the pattern inspection apparatus, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> classifies that defect as a defocus. These classification results are transmitted from the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and shown in the defect information <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a function for classifying each defect information in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and registering it in the defect classification dictionary, and also has a function to learn classification information of defects registered in the defect classification dictionary in order to facilitate classification. It is possible to select automatic execution of the defect information classification function and the classification dictionary registration function by setting the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or manual execution of these functions by the manipulation of an operator. Furthermore, in case of automatic execution, since reduction in processing speed of the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be predicted, it is effective to perform processing by a computer different from the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> makes judgment upon whether a target wafer is acceptable based on the inspection results in the respective inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1 to &num;4 and others) and supplies the judgment result to the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the received judgment result is displayed in the display section, and a warning is displayed if the wafer is rejectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In addition, the information of the inspection results stored in the hard disk <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> or the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is periodically stored in a backup medium in the backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. This backup processing is automatically carried out when the server main body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> receives information indicative of completion or delivery of a product from the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the backup processing, the image information or the like of the respective processes of a corresponding product are collectively backed up based on the information in the data base <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can sort product names by using a backup auto loader during backup and store information of respective lots of the same products in one tape. The backup device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> displays a warning when each tape is full of information, and waits for judgment upon whether the information should be stored on another tape or the tape should be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (&num;1) has a function for notifying the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the image server <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the LAN <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the fact that inspection in another inspection apparatus is required together with information of the defect coordinates and the inspection results when an error is generated in the macro inspection. When the process controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> receives the notification, it instructs the inspection apparatus which requires the inspection to perform the inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Additionally, by connecting the retrieval terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the Internet connected to the LAN <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it is possible to monitor the inspection status through the Web. As a result, a line manager can operate the image server section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from a remote site as well as a factory, thereby communicating the inspection result. Further, by configuring the processing controller <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to display occurrence of an error on the Web and distribute this information to previously specified email addresses when the error is generated in an inspection process, a line manager can be aware of occurrence of the error from a remote site as well as a factory. Furthermore, since the LAN <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for the line in a factory is a system different from the LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transferring images, the burden on the both communication lines can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide the image data file management system and method which can efficiently save the image data and realize efficient management of the backup data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not restricted to the foregoing embodiments, and it can be appropriately modified and carried out without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to provide the image data file management system and method which can efficiently manage the image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
