<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electrostatic actuator which generates pressure by displacing a vibrating plate with electrostatic force, and to a manufacturing method therefor, and also relates to a liquid spraying or discharging device, such as an ink-jet head, for discharging droplets, using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrostatic liquid spraying or discharging device such as an ink-jet head printer, for example, capable of continually performing proper droplet discharging action regardless of external atmospheric pressure fluctuations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The background art will now be described with an inkjet printer as an example of an electrostatic liquid discharging device. An ink-jet printer having an electrostatic ink-jet head is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 6-55732, for example. With this type of ink-jet head, ink within a pressure chamber is discharged from an ink nozzle by vibrating a vibrating plate forming a portion of the pressure chamber wherein ink liquid is stored, by electrostatic force. Accordingly, changes in the external atmospheric pressure alter the discharge properties of the ink droplets, which may cause a problem in that the desired ink droplets may not be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> That is, with an electrostatic ink-jet head, a vibrating plate defining a portion of the pressure chamber faces an electrode plate across a narrow gap, and the vibrating plate is vibrated by electrostatic force by applying a driving voltage therebetween. The gap between the vibrating plate and the electrode plate is extremely narrow, around 1 to 2 microns, so the space between the vibrating plate and the electrode plate is sealed to form a sealed chamber, so that the vibration of the vibrating plate is not inhibited by intrusion of dust and the like therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the event that the external atmospheric pressure fluctuates, the vibrating plate, partitioning off the pressure chamber and the sealed chamber, is displaced in a direction such that the pressure within the sealed chamber matches that of the external atmospheric pressure. Consequently, even when voltage has not been applied, the vibrating plate is in a state of already having been displaced. Thus, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure fluctuates, the vibrating properties of the vibrating plate change even when the same driving voltage is applied, and the discharging properties of the ink droplets (the amount of ink droplets per discharge and the discharging speed of the ink droplets) change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Now, ink-jet printers having a bubble-jet ink-jet head disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 4-284255 are known. This Unexamined Patent Application Publication discloses a method for performing continuously stable ink droplet discharging action regardless of fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure, by detecting the ambient atmospheric pressure and changing the voltage waveform applied to the electro-thermal converting member, that is to say, the driving voltage waveform of the ink-jet head, according to the external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This method is effective for ink-jet heads according to the bubble-jet method wherein ink liquid within the pressure chamber is heated and caused to bubble, but is seldom advantageous when applied to electrostatic ink-jet heads. Particularly, in environments such as high elevations where the atmospheric pressure differs markedly from normal, merely adjusting the driving voltage waveform for driving the vibrating plate may not be sufficient to facilitate appropriate droplet discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Now, electrostatic actuators may be applied to other devices besides the ink-jet printer given here as an example, such as fuel injection devices for internal combustion engines, atomizers for spraying liquids such as perfume, and micro-pumps, but with these devices as well, it is thought that the droplet discharge properties fluctuate according to fluctuation of external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrostatic actuator capable of reliably generating desired pressure unaffected by fluctuations of the external atmospheric pressure, and an electrostatic liquid spraying device capable of discharging droplets in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above objects, the electrostatic actuator according to the present invention comprises a vibrating plate, an electrode plate facing the vibrating plate, and a sealed chamber formed between the electrode plate and the vibrating plate; wherein the vibrating plate is displaced through electrostatic force by applying voltage between the vibrating plate and the electrode plate; the electrostatic actuator having a pressure compensator for decreasing the pressure difference between the internal pressure in the sealed chamber and the external pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The pressure compensator employed may comprise a pressure compensating chamber communicating with the sealed chamber, and may be capable of increasing/decreasing its volume according to external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this case, the entire pressure compensating chamber might be formed of an expanding/contracting material, or a portion of the pressure compensating chamber may be defined by a displacement plate displaceable in the direction perpendicular to its plane (horizontal plane) according to external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Now, the displacement plate is only slightly separated from the facing wall of the pressure compensating chamber, so in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is high, the displacement plate may be displaced and come into contact with the opposing inner wall, thereby inhibiting pressure compensating functions. Also, in the event that the displacement plate is towards the facing wall the compliance thereof decreases, which may also result in the inhibition of pressure compensating functions. Accordingly, the displacement plate is preferably curved in a form so as to protrude in a direction away from the facing inner wall of the pressure compensating chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Next, an arrangement may be used wherein a displacement plate displaceable in the outwards direction of the plane is positioned as a portion of the horizontal pressure compensating chamber, wherein the displacement plate and electrode plate are positioned facing one another, so that the displacement plate is displaced according to changes in external atmospheric pressure, by electrostatic force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the pressure compensator may comprise a heat-generating member capable of at least heating gas sealed in the sealed chamber, instead of the pressure compensating chamber. Heating the sealed gas with the heat-generating member raises the internal pressure thereof, so the pressure difference with the external atmospheric pressure can be relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A preferable material used for configuring the electrostatic actuator is a semiconductor substrate which can be worked with precision. Accordingly, for example, doping a semiconductor substrate with boron, etching the semiconductor substrate, and using the boron doped layer as a displacement plate, allows a displacement plate with desirable properties (compliance) to be obtained. Also, in order to form the electrostatic actuator in a compact size, the vibrating plate and displacement plate are preferably sectioned and formed using a common semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also, the electrostatic liquid spraying or discharging device according to the present invention uses the pressure of the above electrostatic actuator having the pressure compensating functions, as the pressure generating source for discharging droplets. That is, the electrostatic liquid spraying or discharging device comprises a nozzle for discharging droplets, and a pressure chamber communicating with the nozzle and also holding liquid, wherein a vibrating plate provided in a portion of the pressure chamber is vibrated by the above-described electrostatic actuator, thereby providing the liquid in the pressure chamber with pressure fluctuation for discharging droplets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Common ink-jet heads serving as liquid discharging devices are provided with multiple ink nozzles, with pressure chambers provided corresponding to each ink nozzle, and with a common ink chamber (common liquid chamber) for supplying ink liquid to the pressure chambers provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Now, a diaphragm displaceable in the outwards direction of the horizontal plane is in some cases formed at the common ink chamber, so that pressure fluctuations in each of the communicating pressure chambers are not transmitted to the side of the neighboring pressure chamber. In the case of applying the present invention to such an ink-jet head, the diaphragm may also serve as the displacement plate. Also, in order to form the device or a portion thereof (the ink-jet head) in a compact size, the pressure chamber, the common ink chamber, and the pressure compensating chamber are preferably sectioned and formed using a common semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In particular, with a liquid spraying or discharging device comprising an electrostatic actuator of a configuration wherein the displacement plate of the pressure compensating chamber is displaced by electrostatic force, the configuration may have an external atmospheric pressure detector for detecting external atmospheric pressure, and a controller for driving the displacement plate according to the detected external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, with a liquid spraying or discharging device having an electrostatic actuator comprising the heat-generating member, the configuration may have an external atmospheric pressure detector for detecting external atmospheric pressure, and a controller for driving the heat-generating member according to the detected external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now, the external atmospheric pressure detector may be of a configuration comprising an electrostatic capacity detector for detecting the electrostatic capacity between the vibrating plate and the electrode plate, and thereby estimating the external atmospheric pressure based on the detected electrostatic capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The method for manufacturing the electrostatic actuator according to the present invention is a method for manufacturing an electrostatic actuator comprising a vibrating plate, an electrode plate facing the vibrating plate, and a vibrating chamber formed between the electrode plate and the vibrating plate, wherein the vibrating plate is displaced by electrostatic force, by applying voltage across the vibrating plate and the electrode plate, the method comprising: a process for forming a pressure compensating chamber communicating with the vibrating chamber; a process for forming a displacement plate at a portion of the pressure compensating chamber, displaceable according to external atmospheric pressure, into a form curved so as to protrude in a direction away from the facing inner wall of the pressure compensating chamber; and a process for shutting off and sealing the pressure compensating chamber from the external atmosphere, along with the vibrating chamber. Furthermore, the air pressure for sealing the pressure compensating chamber may be adjusted. Accordingly, the initial curvature of the displacement plate is adjusted, and a displacement plate with desired compliance properties can be obtained.</paragraph>

The mechanism system of the ink-jet printer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> according to the present example is a common arrangement, having a platen roller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> serving as a component of a transporting means for transporting recording paper <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, an ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> facing the platen roller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a carriage <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for reciprocally moving the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the line direction (scanning direction) which is the axial direction of the platen roller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and an ink tank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for supplying ink to the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via an ink tube <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> denotes a pump, which is used in the event that a state of defective ink discharge occurs at the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for suctioning the ink via the cap <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and waste ink tube <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> to the waste ink pool <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> (Ink-Jet Head) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a disassembled ink-jet head of the present example; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic longitudinal cross-sectional diagram of the assembled ink-jet head; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic transverse cross-sectional diagram thereof, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the electrode position thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As is shown in these Figures, the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a face type electrostatic ink-jet head wherein ink droplets are discharged from ink nozzles provided on the upper face of a substrate. This ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed of a three-layer structure of an upper nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a lower glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> introduced therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a silicone substrate for example, with the surface of this plate being formed by etching a recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprising the compression chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> wherein the base plate functions as the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a fine groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> forming the ink supplying opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provided on the rear portion of the recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising the common ink chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for supplying ink to each of the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, a recess <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprising an atmospheric pressure or atmosphere communicating chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, communicating with the atmosphere, is formed by etching at a position adjacent to the pressure chamber recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> positioned at the far edge. The base plate portion of this atmospheric pressure chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> functions as the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is displaced according to changes in the external atmospheric pressure. In the present embodiment, the compliance of this displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is set so as to be 10,000 times or greater than the total sum of the compliance of the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Also, a groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is also formed comprising an external atmosphere communicating hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the atmosphere chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to communicate externally. The lower plane of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is smoothed by mirror polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> joined to the upper side of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a silicone substrate for example, the same as the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On the nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, plural ink nozzles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> communicating with the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed at the portion defining the upper plate of the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Also, an ink supplying hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for supplying ink to the common ink chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the portion defining the upper plane of the common ink chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Joining the nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the above recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and fine grooves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to be covered, and the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, ink supplying openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, common ink chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, atmosphere communicating chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and communicating hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be each sectioned and formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Also, the ink supplying hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to the ink tank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) via the connecting pipe <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and tube <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The ink supplied from the ink supplying hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is supplied to the independent pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the ink supplying openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> joined to the lower side of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a borosilicate glass substrate, which has a thermal expansion coefficient close to that of silicon. Within the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, recesses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprising the vibrating chambers (sealed chambers) <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are formed at the portion facing the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> corresponding to the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed at the base planes of the recesses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> have a segment electrode <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and a terminal portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, in the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> a recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the same depth as the recess <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed at the portion facing the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising the base plate portion of the atmosphere communicating chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is connected to the recess <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> via the communicating recess <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. A dummy electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of ITO is formed in the recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Joining the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> defining the base plane of the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the segment electrode portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to face each other across an extremely narrow gap G. This gap G is sealed by a sealing agent <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> placed between the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in a sealed state is thereby formed. Also, the recess <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is covered by the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is the base plate portion of the atmosphere communicating chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the pressure compensation chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for compensating pressure in the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> according to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. The pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is in communication with the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the communicating portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> formed by the communicating recess <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is thin and is capable of elastic deformation in the direction outwards from the plane, in which it is formed i.e., the vertical direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> functions as a common electrode for the side of the pressure chambers. Facing electrodes are formed by the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and corresponding segment electrodes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> across the gap G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), described below, is connected between the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. One output of the head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is connected to the terminals <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the other output is connected to the common electrode terminal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> formed at the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The cavity plate itself has electroconductivity, so voltage can be supplied from the common electrode terminal <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, in the event that there is a need to supply voltage to the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at a lower electrical resistance, a thin film of an electroconducting material such as gold or the like may be formed at one plane of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by vapor deposition, sputtering, or the like. With the present example, a positive pole joining is used for connecting the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so an electroconductive film is formed on the side of the channel formation plane of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Also, the dummy electrodes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are for preventing the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from adhering to the glass substrate side at the time of anodic bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (Pressure Compensating Operation) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> With the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this configuration, applying a driving voltage across the opposing electrodes from the head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> generates electrostatic force due to a charge that arises between the opposing electrodes, the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> deforms toward the side of the segment electrode portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the volume of the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> increases. Next, canceling the driving voltage from the head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the opposing electrodes and discharging the charge therebetween causes the vibrating plate to return by the elastic restoring force thereof, and the volume of the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> rapidly shrinks. Due to the internal pressure fluctuation generated at this time, a portion of ink stored in the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is discharged from the ink nozzle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> communicating with the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to be discharged toward the recording paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Now, a case wherein the external atmospheric pressure changes will be described. For example, in the event that the device is moved from sea level to a high altitude, the external atmospheric pressure drops. In this case, unless the internal pressure of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> also changes, the internal pressure becomes markedly greater than the external atmospheric pressure. Consequently, in order to obtain balanced pressure, the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> deforms upwards in the view shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, so that the volume of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> However, with the present example, the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> communicate with the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> via the communicating portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> faces the atmosphere communicating chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that communicates with the atmosphere, across the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The compliance of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is extremely great as compared to that of the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is displaced upwards in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> view before the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are displaced, thereby increasing the volume of the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and forming a balanced pressure state with the external atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, the gap between the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and individual electrode <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is maintained at a constant value, regardless of fluctuations in external pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As described above, with the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment, even in the event that fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure occur, there are essentially no adverse effects on the vibrating properties of the vibrating plates. Accordingly, constant and stable ink discharging properties can be maintained, regardless of fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, with the ink-jet head according to the present example, the vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are formed in the plane (horizontal) direction. That is, at the time of forming the recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the pressure chamber in the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, i.e., at the time of forming the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also formed to a thickness approximately the same as that of the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, manufacturing of an ink-jet head having pressure compensating functions is simplified. Also, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered by the nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, having the advantage that this portion can be securely protected so that there is no damage thereto. Further, such a protecting portion uses a portion of the nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, having the advantage that manufacturing is simpler than in a case using a separate protective plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> (Control System) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic configuration diagram of the control system of the inkjet printer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment. The circuitry comprising the center of this control system can be formed with a one-chip micro-computer, for example. Briefly describing the overview of the control system according to the present embodiment with reference to the Figures, reference numeral <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> denotes a printer control circuit, and RAM <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and a character generator ROM (CG-ROM) <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are connected to the printer control circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via internal busses <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, including an address bus and data bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A control program is stored within the ROM <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and the driving control action of the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is executed based on the control program called and activated therefrom. The RAM <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is used as the work area for the driving control, and dot patterns corresponding to input characters are rendered in the CG-ROM <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> denotes a head driving control circuit, which outputs driving signals, clock signals, etc., to the head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, under the control of the printer control circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> which is connected via the internal bus <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Also, printing data DATA is provided via the data bus <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is comprised of a TTL array, for example, that generates driving voltage pulses corresponding to input driving signals, and applies these to the individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and common electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are the object of driving, to cause discharge of ink droplets from the corresponding ink nozzles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In order to generate the driving voltage pulses, a ground voltage GND, and driving voltages Vn, are supplied to the head driver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. These voltages Vn are generated from the driving voltage Vcc of the power source circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The carriage motor driving control circuit <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is connected to the printer control circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via the internal bus <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The carriage motor driving control circuit <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> drives the carriage motor (not shown) for reciprocally driving the carriage <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> bearing the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the motor driver <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, so as to move the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> in the Figure. Also, the transport motor driving control circuit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is connected to the printer control circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via the internal bus <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The transport motor driving control circuit <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> drives the transport motor via the motor driver <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, and performs transport control of the recording paper <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> following the platen roller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in the transporting direction shown by the arrow <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> in the Figure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described next, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for pressure compensating in the above ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be formed in a curved plane form under standard external atmospheric pressure at sea level, instead of a flat plate form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a partial cross-sectional diagram of an ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A having the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A in a curved form that bends toward and protrudes into the side of the atmosphere pressure chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The members other than this displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A are the same as those in the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A in such form can be manufactured as follows. A boron-doped layer of silicon is formed by doping with boron the portion of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that will form the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A, before etching the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The boron-doped layer is etched at the same time as the etching to form the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, thereby forming the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Boron is diffused in the boron-doped layer portion, and thus is expanded as compared with other silicon portions. Further, the expansion of the portion where the boron-doped layer is formed is restricted by the silicon portions at both sides thereof which have not been doped with boron. Accordingly, forming a thin displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A at the boron-doped layer portion causes the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to be a curved form that is bent to protrude in the outer direction, or in a recessed form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is positive-pole-joined to the lower side of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A to which the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A is formed, and a sealed pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is sectioned and formed by the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and the opposing glass substrate portion. The opposite side of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A faces the atmosphere pressure chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A bends in a protruding curved plane form toward the side of the atmosphere pressure chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> With the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A having the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A bent in a protruding curved plane form toward the side of the atmosphere pressure chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described above, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is high, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A is pressed toward the side of the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and deforms. Accordingly, the atmospheric pressure fluctuations can more effectively compensated for in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is high, as compared with the flat displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> However, such a displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A which protrudes toward the side of the atmosphere pressure must bend even further in the protruding direction in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is lower than the internal pressure of the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (the atmospheric pressure at the time of sealing this chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>), so the compliance drops. Accordingly, the pressure compensating functions thereof may not be sufficiently exhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating a properties curve qualitatively illustrating the degree of compliance of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A. as a function of the external atmospheric pressure. In this graph, the horizontal axis indicates external atmospheric pressure, and the vertical axis indicates compliance. As can be understood from this graph, the lower the external atmospheric pressure compared to the air pressure at the time of sealing the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the lower the compliance of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A, and this rapidly deteriorates in a non-linear form. That is, displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A does not bend as readily, and accordingly, the pressure compensating functions thereof rapidly deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the event that the external atmospheric pressure is low, in order to sufficiently raise the compliance of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A so as to be sufficiently high even at high elevations for example, the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is preferably sealed at reduced pressure. For example, the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is preferably sealed at a reduced pressure state of around 650 hPa&plusmn;50 hPa absolute pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the behavior of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A sealed at a reduced pressure. In the Figure, the solid line represents the state of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A before air-tight sealing, the dotted line represents the state of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A after reduced-pressure sealing, and the broken line represents the state of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Thus, even in the event that the external atmospheric pressure is high, the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A does not come into contact with the base plane of the pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (the surface of the dummy electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>) and stop functioning. Also, as can be understood from the graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the relationship of compliance of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure remains almost linear, so compensation according to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure can be performed properly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(A), applying voltage across the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates an electrostatic attractive force, whereby the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is drawn toward the electrode side and is deformed. Consequently, the volume of the first pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced, and the internal pressure of the communicating vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D is increased. Stopping application of the voltage causes elastic restoration of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so the internal pressure of the communicating vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D returns to its original state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> For example, in the event that the ambient atmospheric pressure is a certain value, voltage is applied between the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is drawn toward the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(B). In the event that the external atmospheric pressure drops, lowering the applied voltage or stopping the voltage application causes the internal pressure of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D to drop, so the pressure difference between the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D and the external atmospheric pressure decreases. Accordingly, the vibrating properties of the vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D can be held constant, and change in the ink discharge properties can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure increases, raising the applied voltage causes the deformation of the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to increase, and the pressure in the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D is raised, so the pressure difference with the external atmospheric pressure is reduced, and a change in the ink discharge properties can be avoided in this case, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Now, in the event that the amount of change in the external atmospheric pressure is great, a volume change in the second pressure compensation chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be used as follows. In the event that the ambient atmospheric pressure is a certain value, voltage is applied between the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is drawn toward the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(A). In the event that the external atmospheric pressure rises, voltage is applied across the second displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is also deformed. Consequently, the capacity of the second pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also is reduced, so the pressure of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D can be greatly increased to match the rise in external atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, the pressure difference between external atmospheric pressure which has risen greatly and the internal pressure of the vibrating chambers can be reduced or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Conversely, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure drops, application of voltage is stopped, so that the first displacement plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> returns to its original state, thereby increasing the volume of the first pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the internal pressure of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>D drops, and the pressure difference between external atmospheric pressure and the internal pressure is reduced or eliminated. The voltage application control for the electrodes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for increasing or decreasing the volume of the first and second pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be performed by a control mechanism described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, external atmospheric pressure is detected by air pressure detector <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the set air pressure is compared with the detected external atmospheric pressure by pressure comparator <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and the displacement plates <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are displaced with displacement plate driver <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, based on the comparison results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, various sensors can be used for the air pressure detector, such as electrostatic capacity air pressure sensors, piezoelectric air pressure sensors, and so forth.

The basic structure of the ink-jet head <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E according to the present embodiment is the same as that of the above-described embodiments, with a nozzle plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E and glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E being layered above and below with a cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E therebetween.

Vibrating plates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E are formed at the base plane portions of the pressure chambers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E having a gap for allowing displacement of the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E is sectioned and formed between the lower plane of the cavity plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E. Individual electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>E are formed of ITO in the base plane of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is characterized in that instead of providing a pressure compensating chamber wherein the volume fluctuates according to a displacement plate of the pressure compensator, a heat controlling member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is used to heat or cool a sealed gas in the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E, thereby increasing or reducing the internal pressure of the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E, and consequently reducing or eliminating the pressure difference between the vibrating chambers <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and; the external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As is known from Boyle-Charles&apos; law, air pressure can be controlled by heat. For example, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure increases, the heat controlling member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is activated to generate heat, and heating the vibrating chamber formation portion of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E heats the gas within the vibrating chamber and the gas attempts to expand. However, the vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E is sealed, so the internal pressure increases, and the pressure difference with the external atmospheric pressure is relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Conversely, in the event that the external atmospheric pressure drops, the heat controlling member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> performs an endothermic or cooling action, thereby cooling the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E, which cools the gas within the vibrating chamber, thus lowering the internal pressure. Accordingly, the pressure difference with the external atmospheric pressure can be relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The heat controlling member may be a heat-generating member such as a tantalum nitride thin film, for example. Alternatively, this may be capable of endothermic action, such as a Peltier device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of the driving control mechanism of the heat controlling member. As shown in the Figure, the air pressure detector <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> detects the external atmospheric pressure. The detected external atmospheric pressure is converted into the internal temperature of the vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E, in the air pressure/temperature converter <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The converted temperature is compared with a preset target temperature in the temperature comparator <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The heat controlling member driver <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> drives the heat controlling member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> based on the comparison results, such that the temperature within the vibrating chamber meets the target temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Temperature detector <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be attached to the glass substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>), comparing the detected value with the target temperature in order to execute even more precise temperature management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Also, detection of the air pressure may be calculating based on the electrical capacity between the vibrating plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E and electrode <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>E in the vibrating chamber <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E, instead of mounting an air pressure sensor or the like on the ink-jet printer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> With the above-described embodiments, a displacement plate is formed on one portion of the pressure compensating chamber, so that the volume of the pressure compensating chamber increases or decreases by the displacement plate being displaced according to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. Instead of this, an arrangement may be used wherein the entire pressure compensating chamber <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is formed of an elastic material, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, so that the entirety thereof expands or contracts according to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As described above, the electrostatic actuator according to the present invention has a pressure compensator for reducing or eliminating the pressure difference between the internal pressure of vibrating chambers partitioned by vibrating plates and the external atmospheric pressure, so the vibrating properties of the vibrating plate do not change according to fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, a liquid discharging device in which the present invention is applied is capable of continually performing stable droplet discharging action, regardless of fluctuations in the external atmospheric pressure. For example, an ink jet printer using the present invention is capable of continuously performing high-quality image formation, regardless of where it is used, whether at high elevations or at sea level, etc. </paragraph>
