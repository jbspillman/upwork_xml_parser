<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A gasification reactor apparatus (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) comprising a gasification vessel (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), a gas-fired combustion chamber (<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) and a combination fan and cyclone unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) in an upper part (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;) of the vessel (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) with two functions: first, the fan (<highlight><bold>62,64</bold></highlight>) impels incoming feedstock (<highlight><bold>14,14</bold></highlight>&prime;) centrifugally into contact with the hot inside surface of the vessel to produce rapid onset of gasification. Second, the unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) exerts a cyclonic motion on the product gas causing outward separation of particulate matter from the gas, which passes to the outlet via a path through the middle of the vessel (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a gasification reaction apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the subject apparatus is for converting organic materials, or materials containing organic matter, into high calorific value gas. It is especially applicable to the disposal of wastes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is an ever-pressing need to dispose of wastes such as commercial and municipal (domestic) wastes. Landfill has been a traditional means of disposal but has numerous drawbacks which are well known. Incineration is a possibly better method of disposal, but has its limitations. In particular, energy conversion rates are comparatively low, and the utilization of waste heat, such as for district heating, is beset with efficiency problems and high capital costs of heat distribution. Incinerators produce large volumes of flue gases of low calorific value. They must be cleaned, expensively, before discharge to the atmosphere. Incinerators also yield large quantities of ash, which require disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Incineration therefore is by no means an ideal alternative to land-fill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Gasification is a potentially attractive alternative to incineration. In gasification, organic matter is decomposed directly, i.e. converted pyrolytically in the absence of air, into combustible gas and ash. Unfortunately, with present gasifiers the gas produced is heavily contaminated with carbon and ash particles. The gas needs considerable and costly cleaning before it can be efficiently utilized as a source of heat or for conversion into electricity. Frequently, the gas produced by existing gasification plant is contaminated with highly toxic dioxins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention has for its object the development of a highly efficient converter or gasifier capable of yielding clean, high calorific value gas with minimal ash. Another object is to devise an adaptable converter or gasifier design suitable for implementation in large-scale municipal waste disposal sites, as well as for implementation in small sites such as in hotels, factories and shopping precincts. In the latter implementation, the gasifier desirably would provide all the energy needs of the site, and could make it substantially self-sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A municipal waste disposal plant embodying the present gasification reaction apparatus can be organised as described in the following overview. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Incoming solid waste is passed to a sorting station. Here, ferrous and non-ferrous metal objects are removed. Also removed are ceramic and vitreous objects. The remaining solid waste is primarily of organic matter, including cellulosic, plastics and rubber materials. The waste is now passed to a shredding station, to be broken down into small particles of relatively uniform size. At this stage, the waste will normally contain large amounts of moisture, so it is passed to a drier. Energy for the drier is taken from the exhaust of the boiler/engine and used for the further conversion of gas to usable energy, ie electricity or heat. Moisture driven off as water vapour may be condensed for discharge to a sewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The dried waste, if in the form of a cake is comminuted, and is then delivered to the gasifier for decomposition into flammable gas and ash. The gas which is produced can be used for various purposes, but the primary use is for driving a gas turbine generator for producing electricity, some or all of which may be supplied for gain to the national grid system. Some of the gas is used for heating the gasification apparatus. Exhaust from the later can be used to heat the drier indirectly. Exhaust from the gas turbine generator can be fed to a heat exchanger for producing superheated steam, for powering a steam turbine generator. Some of the steam might be used for heating the drier. Electricity produced by the steam turbine generator may be utilised for the plant installation&apos;s needs or may be supplied for gain to the grid system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It will be seen from the foregoing outline that a gasification plant is economically highly desirable. Acquisition of the fuel, (waste), may cost the plant operator nothing. Indeed, the operator may well be able to charge waste producers for disposing of the waste. Once up and running, the plant need have no significant operational costs other than staffing and routine maintenance and repair. The energy input for operating the plant can be derived effectively from the waste itself. Surplus energy derived from the waste can be sold for profit, e.g. as electrical or thermal energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> By this invention, a method of gasifying solid or liquid organic matter for producing high calorific value product gas, involves the steps of heating a gasification vessel to elevated temperature while excluding air therefrom, admitting feedstock airlessly to the top of the vessel and centrifugally dispersing the feedstock by a fan into immediate contact with the heated inside of the vessel, for decomposition into gas and ash, and exerting a cyclone motion on the product gas within the vessel for cracking it and for ridding it substantially of particulate matter such as ash, the gas being conducted to an outlet along a central axial path through the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides at an improved gasification reaction apparatus. According to the invention, therefore, there is provided a gasification reactor apparatus, comprising a combustion chamber wherein is mounted a gasification vessel which has an inlet for feedstock to be gasified and an outlet for discharging product gas, the inlet including air-isolating and sealing means for preventing ingress of air to the vessel with feedstock, and in an upper part of the vessel there is a combination rotary fan and cyclone unit which, in use, respectively (a) disperses incoming feedstock into contact with a heated inside wall of the vessel and (b) establishes a cyclone in the product gas for ridding the gas of particulate matter before discharge from the outlet.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The gasification reaction apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a gasification vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, e.g. made of stainless steel. In this vessel, feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is pyrolytically converted into high calorific value gas, and ash, in a non-oxidizing atmosphere inside the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a right-cylindrical upper part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; and a frusto-conical lower part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&Prime; which tapers towards and terminates in an ash collector <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The latter is provided with two spaced-apart gate valves <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which form an air lock, by means of which ash can periodically be discharged without letting air into the gasification vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The gasification vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a cyclone fan unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its upper part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being mounted on a hollow shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which extends upwards from the vessel. The shaft is contained inside an upstanding duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> welded to a top cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the vessel. In turn, the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is coupled to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The drive shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is suspended in a sealed, air and gas tight bearing assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which closes the top of the duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and preferably is fluid cooled. Electric motor drive device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided for rotating the two shafts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and hence the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The two shafts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are in essence supported only by the bearing assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends down through the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Mounted on its bottom end is a graphite bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which internally receives a centering pin mounted on a spider <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. There is a clearance of 1 mm or so between the inside of bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the centering pin. Together, the bush and pin do not function as a bearing for the shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>; only the bearing assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supports the shaft for rotation. The pin and bush <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> primarily constitute a safety measure, to constrain or restrict radial movement of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to within safe limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Air cannot enter the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and particularly the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described so far, nor can gas escape from the vessel except by way of a gas duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is branched from the upstanding duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and includes a connection <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to a safety pressure seal, not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; for conversion into gas is introduced airlessly into vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through an inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> featuring an air-tight, telescopic expansion conduit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is welded to the top cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the main, the feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be municipal solid waste in small particulate, dried form which is largely fibrous in nature. However, the feedstock is by no means limited to municipal solid waste. Indeed, other organic feedstocks can be used and they need not be solid. For instance, used oils can be fed by line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> into the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for gasification as feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. Such oils can be converted into especially high calorific value gas. In some cases, it may be desirable to introduce both solid and liquid feedstocks at the same time to the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as using a mixture of feedstock allows the chemical composition and calorific value of the product gas to be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Solid feedstock is airlessly supplied to the vessel inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by a sealed feeder apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the feeder apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which supplies the solid feedstock airlessly to the conduit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, comprises a chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with a feedstock inlet <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a feedstock outlet which opens to the conduit. Sealing means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at a location between the inlet and outlet spans the chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The sealing means includes a pair of contra-rotary rollers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> contacting each other and forming a yieldable nip. The nip is of a substantial vertical extent and allows feedstock to pass between the rollers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in its passage toward the outlet, and forms a seal substantially preventing gas or air from passing between the rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sealed feeder apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is placed beneath a supply conveyor (not shown), to receive particulate feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the conveyor. The sealing means <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> effectively partitions the chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into two parts, one including the inlet <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> being open to the atmosphere and the other, below the sealing means, being isolated thereby from the atmosphere. Thanks to the yieldable rollers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which are driven by a motor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> falling under gravity from the conveyor is passed, without air, into the lower part of the chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. From there, the feedstock is advanced to the outlet, conduit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by an oscillating bar conveyor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, of known kind. The lower part of the chamber can be provided with at least one gas fitting (not shown). By this means, at start up of apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the lower part of the chamber can be evacuated or flushed with inert gas. It will be filled with gas produced in the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during actual gasification operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As stated, the sealing means comprises a pair of contacting, contra-rotating rollers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> forming a yieldable sealing nip, the rollers having yieldable, resilient compressible peripheries formed by polymeric tires. Particles of feedstock which enter the yieldable sealing nip are conveyed downwardly, in the nip, the resilient, compressible peripheries yielding, or giving to embrace and entrap the feedstock particles while simultaneously preventing any significant quantity of air from passing into the lower part of the chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises an uppermost metal disc <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> rigidly affixed to the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. On the top surface of the disc <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, fan blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are mounted. The disc <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are disposed close beneath the top cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the blades rotate close beneath the inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. There can be three, four or more fan blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Also rigidly affixed to the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and to the bottom surface of the disc, are a plurality of metal paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, e.g. four in number. Each paddle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can project radially from the shaft, and can have its outermost part bent, curved or angled forwardly, i.e. in the direction of rotation of the cyclone fan. The paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are disposed at even spacings about the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Instead of projecting radially of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the paddles can be&mdash;and preferably are&mdash;disposed tangentially to it, so as to project forwardly in the direction of rotation of the cyclone fan. Again, in this arrangement each paddle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has its outermost part bent, curved or angled forwardly. In use, when the cyclone fan is rotating, the paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> set up a swirling motion of the gas in the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> each have a square or rectangular upper part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; and a tapered, triangular lower part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The metal disc <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, fan blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be made of stainless steel, welded to one another and to the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted inside a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The combustion chamber has a top <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, bottom <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and sidewall <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> fabricated from steel with thick insulating linings, e.g. of firebricks, fireclay or ceramic fibre. A plurality of gas burners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are mounted at spaced intervals about the sidewall <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. They burn a mixture of combustible gas and air, and in operation heat the vessel to a temperature of about 900&deg; C. or more. In use, the combustible gas can be a proportion of the gas produced by gasification of the feedstock. When starting the gasification process, however, any convenient combustible gas can be substituted, e.g. propane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The gas burners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are preferably as described in our British patent application GB 9812975.2 but any suitable burner may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Combustion products within the chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are exhausted to atmosphere by exhaust duct <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the gaseous combustion products are first cooled by heat exchange in a steam or hot water generator (not shown) The recovered heat is desirably used in the plant, e.g. the drier used for removing moisture from the feedstock. After heat exchange, the combustion products are then exhausted to atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Operation of the gasification reaction apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Upon start up from cold, an inert gas such as nitrogen is introduced into the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through an inlet (not shown), and exhausted via the duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The sealed feeder apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also flushed with inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While the inert gas atmosphere is maintained in the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the burners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are ignited and the vessel is brought up to temperature. The temperature of vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be assessed by known means such as a pyrometer (not shown). Meanwhile, the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated at a speed of 500-1000 rpm by the electric motor drive device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Once vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is at the desired temperature, supply of feedstock is commenced. Feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; passing through the inlet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> encounters the rapidly-revolving fan blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and is flung outwards against the hot inside surface of the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Gasification into high calorific value gas commences rapidly, it is believed within one hundredth of a second. Such rapid onset of gasification is thought to be an important factor in the avoidance of dioxins production. As feedstock supply and gasification continue, it is found that the gas produced exerts a propelling effect on the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, maintaining its rotation. As a result, electric power to the drive motor device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be switched off. Moreover, it can then be used as a generator of electricity usable in the plant. As gasification proceeds, supply of inert gas can be shut off and the high calorific gas can be caused to exit the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for further treatment, collection and use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> During gasification, the produced gas may be contaminated by particulates. However, as noted above, the paddles <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> set up a swirling motion&mdash;or cyclone effect&mdash;in the gas. As a result, the particulate matter is projected outwardly against the inside of vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If this matter has not been fully gasified, its decomposition and gasification will continue in the vicinity of the inside of vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and ultimately it is converted to ash. The cyclone effect successfully rids the gas of particulate contaminants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The gas produced in due course enters the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by way of lower openings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; therein. It passes up the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and issues into the upper region of the duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via shaft openings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Most of the gas leaves duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, but a proportion of the gas passes down the duct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> back into the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, into which it is drawn by the centrifugal action of the fan blades <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the gas drawn in assisting the flow of incoming feedstock to the hot inside surface of the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Gas entering the duct <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is passed to a blast cooler or scrubber, where it is very rapidly cooled by passage through cooling water or oil sprays. Cooling by such a cooler or scrubber leaves the gas in a particularly clean state, and can ensure that conversion of its components into contaminants such as dioxins is successfully avoided. The ensuing gas burns very cleanly and its combustion products can pose minimal environmental problems when discharged to atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The gas produced can be used in small part to feed the burners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The main gas production is converted into heat or electrical energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By way of non-limitative example, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can have a cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of 3.6 m diameter, and the vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can consume about 1.5 tonne of dry municipal solid waste per hour. Such apparatus can commence gas production about 1 hour after starting up from cold. In emergency, gas production can be halted in about 25 seconds by terminating the supply of feedstock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The efficiency of conversion of feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; into gas is of the order of 90-95%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The gas produced per hour can yield about 2.5 to 14 MW, depending on the nature of the feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. If this gas is consumed in a turbine generator to produce electricity, the peak conversion efficiency is 42% or so. In practice, depending on the quality of the feedstock, 0.7 to 4.5 MW of electricity can be generated from 1.0 tonne of the dry feedstock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If the gas obtained from the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used partly for heating (e.g. space heating) and partly for electricity generation, yields may be 30% electrical energy and 50% heat energy. Expected energy loss is 20%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The wall of the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is pierced by a row of five, vertically aligned through-holes <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> the row of holes <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> being positioned so as to be towards the lower portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is also pierced by a row of five, vertically aligned through-holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the row of holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> being positioned within the upper portion of the duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A duct <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> set in the side of the upper duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is used to extract gases from the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which pass into the interior of the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> via holes <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and exit to within the duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> from the interior of the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> through holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The upper portion of the duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is substantially sealed from the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by an annular gas restrictor <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is fed airlessly into the vessel by <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by a feeder apparatus (not shown) as described with reference to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a closed conical collar <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> secured on the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> towards the top of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and on whose sloping upper surface are mounted four (in this case) equidistantly spaced upstanding plates <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> (two shown) extending radially from near the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the base of the conical collar <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Depending vertically downwardly from the rim of the conical collar <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are, in this embodiment, twenty-four planar fan blades <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> which are set angled slightly away from radial alignment so as to be directed towards the direction of motion of the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> viewed radially outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The fan blades <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> could also be slightly curved in the radial direction across their horizontal width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The fan blades <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are supported in their vertical orientation from the conical collar <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> by a pair of vertically spaced spiders <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> each fixed horizontally between the shaft <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and each of the fan blades <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A frustro-conical wear tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is welded to the corner of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the junction of the domed top <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&Prime; and side wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> adjacent the outermost extent of the plates <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is mounted inside a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with gas burners (not shown) constructed of the same materials as the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but configured to surround the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Combustion products within the chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are exhausted to atmosphere by exhaust duct (not shown). Preferably, the gaseous combustion products are first cooled by heat exchange in a steam or hot water generator (not shown). The recovered heat is desirably used in the plant, e.g. the drier used for removing moisture from the feedstock. After heat exchange, the combustion products are then exhausted to atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Operation of the gasification reaction apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is as described above with reference to the apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Upon start up from cold, an inert gas such as nitrogen is introduced into the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through an inlet (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> While the inert gas atmosphere is maintained in the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is brought up to temperature. and the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotated at a speed of 500-1000 rpm by the electric motor drive device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Once vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is at the desired temperature, supply of feedstock is commenced. Feedstock <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; passing through the inlet duct <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> encounters the rapidly-revolving plates <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and is flung outwards against the hot inside surface of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the wear plate <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> shielding the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the inital impact point with the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Gasification into high calorific value gas commences rapidly, as before. As feedstock supply and gasification continue, the gas produced exerts a propelling effect on the cyclone fan <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, maintaining its rotation and, again, electric power to the drive motor device <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can be switched off and it can then be used as a generator of electricity usable in the plant. As gasification proceeds, supply of inert gas can be shut off and the high calorific gas can be caused to exit the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> via duct <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for further treatment, collection and use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The paddles <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> set up and maintain a swirling motion&mdash;or cyclone effect&mdash;in the gas in the volume of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the particulate matter being projected outwardly against the inside of vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. If this matter has not been fully gasified, its decomposition and gasification will continue in the vicinity of the inside of vessel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and ultimately it is converted to ash. The cyclone effect successfully rids the gas of particulate contaminants as the gas produced in due course enters the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the centre of the vessel, away from teh particulates which are flung to the vessel side wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; by way of lower openings <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> therein. It passes up the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and issues into the upper region of the duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via shaft openings <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Most of the gas leaves duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> via duct <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, but a proportion of the gas passes down the duct <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> back into the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, into which it is drawn by the centrifugal action of the plates <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, the gas drawn in assisting the flow of incoming feedstock to the hot inside surface of the vessel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Gas entering the duct <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is, as before, passed to a blast cooler or scrubber, where it is very rapidly cooled by passage through cooling water or oil sprays. Cooling by such a cooler or scrubber leaves the gas in a particularly clean state, and can ensure that conversion of its components into contaminants such as dioxins is successfully avoided. The ensuing gas burns very cleanly and its combustion products can pose minimal environmental problems when discharged to atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The gas produced can be used in small part to feed the burners (not shown). The main gas production is converted into heat or electrical energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It is expected that in a typical municipal disposal site, there may be as many as nine apparatuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> running in parallel. Power output is predicted to be of the order of 30 MW electrical energy and 50-60 MW heat energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The gas produced from municipal solid waste is desirably low in noxious halogenated compounds. A typical chromatographic analysis shows that the amount of such compounds is insignificant. </paragraph>
