<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to foamed fracturing fluids, additives for foaming the fracturing fluids and methods of using the fracturing fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Viscous gelled fracturing fluids are commonly utilized in the hydraulic fracturing of subterranean zones penetrated by well bores to increase the production of hydrocarbons from the subterranean zones. That is, a viscous fracturing fluid is pumped through the well bore into a subterranean zone to be stimulated at a rate and pressure such that fractures are formed and extended into the subterranean zone. The fracturing fluid also carries particulate proppant material, e.g., graded sand, into the formed fractures. The proppant material is suspended in the viscous fracturing fluid so that the proppant material is deposited in the fractures when the viscous fracturing fluid is broken and recovered. The proppant material functions to prevent the fractures from closing whereby conductive channels are formed through which produced fluids can flow to the well bore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After the viscous fracturing fluid has been pumped into a subterranean zone in a formation and fracturing of the zone has taken place, the fracturing fluid is removed from the formation to allow produced hydrocarbons to flow through the created fractures. Generally, the removal of the viscous fracturing fluid is accomplished by converting the fracturing fluid into a low viscosity fluid. This has been accomplished by adding a delayed breaker, i.e., a viscosity reducing agent, to the fracturing fluid prior to pumping it into the subterranean zone. Examples of delayed breakers that can be used include, but are not limited to, enzymes, acids and oxidizing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In carrying out hydraulic fracturing, the fracturing fluids must often be lightweight to prevent excessive hydrostatic pressure from being exerted on subterranean formations penetrated by the well bore. As a result, a variety of lightweight fracturing fluids have heretofore been developed and used including foamed fracturing fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Foamed fracturing fluids have heretofore included various surfactants known as foaming and foam stabilizing agents for facilitating the foaming and stabilization of the foam produced when a gas is mixed with the fracturing fluid. However, the foaming and stabilizing surfactants have not met complete environmental requirements. That is, when the foaming and stabilizing surfactants find their way into water in the environment, they do not fully degrade which can result in interference with aquatic life cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there are needs for improved foamed fracturing fluids, improved fracturing fluid foaming and stabilizing additives which degrade completely in the environment and are harmless thereto and improved methods of utilizing the foamed fracturing fluids. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

The additive is preferably predissolved in water to form an aqueous solution which is added to a fracturing fluid to be foamed along with a gas for foaming the fracturing fluid. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One liter of tap water was placed in a Waring blender and 2% potassium chloride was added. 2.4 grams of hydroxypropyl guar (20 pounds per 1000 gallons) were stirred into the 2% potassium chloride solution. The solution was adjusted to a pH of 6.0 by the addition of sodium diacetate. The solution was stirred vigorously for 20 minutes to allow the guar to hydrate fully. The gel yielded a viscosity of 12 centipoises at 300 rpm on a Fann model 35 viscometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 100 milliliters of the hydrated gel were placed in a Waring blender jar. 0.5 milliliters of keratin foaming agent were added to the blender jar at a very low blender speed to give the foam sufficient time to build. The speed of the blender and the shear rate were increased until the foam reached a maximum height in the blender jar. 60 grams of 20/40 sand (5 pounds per gallon) were added to the blender jar with stirring to equally disperse the sand throughout the foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The resulting 70 quality foam was poured into a 500 milliliter graduated cylinder so that settling of the sand could be observed. Approximately 5% of the 20/40 sand settled after one hour at room temperature. Stated another way, 95% of the 20/40 sand stayed suspended in the foam for one hour. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One liter of tap water was placed in a Waring blender and 2% potassium chloride was added. 2.4 grams of hydroxypropyl guar (220 pounds per 1000 gallons) were stirred into the 2% potassium chloride solution. The solution was adjusted to a pH of 6.0 by the addition of sodium diacetate. The solution was stirred vigorously for 20 minutes to allow the guar to hydrate fully. The gel yielded a viscosity of 12 centipoises at 300 rpm on a Fann model 35 viscometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A solution of 10 milliliters of tap water, a foam stabilizer comprised of 2 grams of potassium iodine and 1.66 grams of iodine was prepared. 100 milliliters of the above described hydrated gel were placed in a Waring blender jar and stirring was started. 0.5 milliliters of the above described foam stabilizer were added and allowed to disperse followed by the addition of 0.5 milliliters of keratin foaming agent added at a very low blender speed to give the foam sufficient time to build. The mixing and the shear rate were increased until the foam reached the maximum height in the blender jar. 60 grams of 20/40 sand were added while stirring to allow the sand to be equally dispersed throughout the foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The resulting 70 quality foam containing the dispersed sand was poured into a 500 milliliter graduated cylinder to observe sand settling. Trace quantities of the 20/40 sand settled after one hour at room temperature. Stated another way, greater than 99% of the 20/40 sand stayed suspended in the foam for one hour. </paragraph>
