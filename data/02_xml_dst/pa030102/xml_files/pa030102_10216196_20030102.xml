<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned very small computer, when the power switch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is depressed, then icon groups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which can effect various processings shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> are displayed on the upper portion and right-hand side of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If an icon <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;see&rsqb; of the icon groups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and one of characters train of &lsqb;action&rsqb;, &lsqb;connection&rsqb;, &lsqb;report&rsqb; and so on displayed on the left side of the &lsqb;see&rsqb; icon <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, for example, &lsqb;report&rsqb; is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a report picture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> is displayed on the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, a picture of eagle <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> drawn on the report picture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a picture drawn, for example, on the first page of the report page. A name <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> who draws this picture is displayed on the end portion of this report page. Such many pages are memorized in the memory as report data and stored therein. Each page on these report pictures is not provided with a page number because it is very troublesome to rewrite the page number when one report is stored. Further, the content of &lsqb;report&rsqb; is not limited to the figure or the like and sentences and so on are written in the &lsqb;report&rsqb; in most cases. Of course, if a write icon <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;write&rsqb; is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and of the icon groups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> arrayed on the upper portion of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a printing type icon <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;printing type&rsqb; or a figure icon <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;figure&rsqb; is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a printing type plate or a figure plate is dragged in the report picture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the printing type or the figure can be drawn on the report pictures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. &lsqb;connection&rsqb; is generally used to write or to check a telephone directory, an address book and so on. Further, &lsqb;action&rsqb; is used to write or to check a schedule table or the like, and respective pages of these various data are stored in the memory in the form of cards. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, following the Start of operation, in first step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the power switch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is turned ON first and the icon groups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are displayed on the upper portion and right portion of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. When of these icon groups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> displayed on the right side of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> other icon <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;others&rsqb; which is located on the lowermost portion of the icon group <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an owner page is opened, then an owner page picture <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is displayed on the display portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. On the owner page, in addition to a column <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in which owner&apos;s name, address of owner&apos;s home, phone number of owner&apos;s home, address of owner&apos;s company, phone number of owner&apos;s company and so on are written, an owner name column <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which owner&apos;s name such as <custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00001.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/><custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00002.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00002"/>, sign or pen name and so on are written is provided. In this owner column, A, B, O and AB denote blood types and &quest; denotes an unknown blood type. If the owner touches own blood type, the owner&apos;s blood type is registered. In second step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, if the printing type icon <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;printing type&rsqb; of the icon group <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the top of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is dragged up to the center of the picture screen of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> without lifting the top of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the picture screen of the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then the printing type icon <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is enlarged and the printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is obtained as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. This printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is displayed in a superimposed fashion on the owner picture <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is displayed at the position in which the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is lifted off from the picture screen. In the printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> superimposed upon the owner picture <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as described above, a hand-writing key <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is placed in an active state as shown by a hatched portion in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. If the name of, for example, &ldquo;<custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00003.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00003"/><custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00004.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00004"/>&rdquo; is written on a box-shaped portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a kanji key <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of characters key is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a recognition key <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> recognizes the hand-written characters and converts the recognized characters into predetermined printing type kanji characters, which are then displayed on the box-shaped portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, the registration of the owner&apos;s name on the owner name column <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While in the second step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the printing type plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is opened and the owner signs his name, the figure plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> written as &lsqb;figure&rsqb; may be opened and the owner may sign his name on this figure plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If registration of owner name, the sign or pen name or the like on the owner name column <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is finished, then the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> writes the signed owner name and the registration time on the end portion of each card data in accordance with the flowcharts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (formed of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> drawn on two sheets of drawings so as to permit the use of a suitably large scale), following the Start of operation, it is determined in first step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whether or not a write page is opened by touching the write icon <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If the write page is not opened as represented by a NO at step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then other processing is performed at second step ST<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the processing returns to the first step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the write page is opened as represented by a YES at step ST<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to third decision step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In third step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the figure icon <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;figure&rsqb; is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the figure plate is reproduced on the report picture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of, for example, the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the write icon <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> described as &lsqb;printing type&rsqb; is touched with the point of the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the printing type plate is reproduced on the report picture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of, for example, the display section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and new figure or new character is written in the figure plate or in the printing type plate. If a NO is output at step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the next fourth decision step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In decision step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not any data is already written, for example, in the opened report page (action page and connection page may be possible). If no data is written on the opened report page as represented by a NO at step ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the opened report page is a blank page and the processing proceeds to the end. If the opened report page or card is a page in which something is already written, this card is sent to the fifth decision step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is determined in step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> whether or not this card is copied. If a NO is output at-step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the processing proceeds to the end, whereas if a YES is output at step ST<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to fifth step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, when the copy is performed, a copy icon <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) is dragged and the copy processing is carried out by a copy plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>. In this copy plate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, the copy is performed by designating the number of copies, a page designating key and a copy starting key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> While there is a possibility that a plurality of copies may be required, in these copies, the owner name, sign and pen name (referred to later) written on the owner name column are rewritten as &lsqb;copy&rsqb; <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows the report picture in the above-mentioned condition. That is, in the case of the copy, the owner name is not the writer name and the writer name becomes the &lsqb;copy&rsqb; <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. If a YES is output at step ST<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in which new data is written in the figure plate or in the printing type plate, then the processing proceeds to the next decision step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is determined at decision step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> whether or not the page is turned over. If the page is turned over as represented by a YES at step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, whereat the content of writer column (owner name column), that is, name of &lsqb;<custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00005.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00005"/><custom-character file="US20030005003A1-20030102-P00006.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00006"/>&rsqb; or the like is copied to the corresponding position of the determined page and then the processing proceeds to the end. If a NO is output at decision step ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the next decision step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereat it is determined whether or not the data is recorded on a floppy disk. If a YES in which data is recorded on the floppy disk is output at step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the name on the owner name column is copied similarly to step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In that case, step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not limited to the floppy disk and may be applied to the case that data is recorded on a magnetic medium such as a magnetic tape, a hard disk and so on or a recordable, a rewritable optical disk and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> At the completion of step ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the end. If a NO is output at step ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the next decision step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is determined in step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whether or not the card, which is turned over, is printed out. If the card is printed out as represented by a YES at step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, then the owner name is copied similarly to step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the processing proceeds to the end. If a NO is output at step ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the next decision step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is determined in step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> whether or not the power source is turned OFF. If the power source is turned OFF as represented by a YES at step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereat the owner name is copied similarly to the step ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Then, the processing proceeds to the end. Under the condition that the steps ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are finished, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</cross-reference>, a name <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> signed on the end portion of each card data is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If a NO is output at step ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to the next decision step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, whereat it is determined whether or not the name is copied. If a YES is output at step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, then the processing proceeds to step ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In step ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the copy is performed similarly to step ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the writer column of the copied page is changed to &lsqb;copy&rsqb; <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>. That is, in step ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, since it is the copy of the writer who describes the data in the card, the signature of owner name is removed. While the flowchart in steps ST<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrates the case such that the owner name signed on the card data in which something is already written is changed to &lsqb;copy&rsqb;, step ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shows the case that the signature of the writer who writes data immediately after new data is written in the card is changed to &lsqb;copy&rsqb; and &lsqb;copy&rsqb; is determined. Similarly, steps ST<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> illustrate the case that the signature of the writer who writes data immediately after new data is written in the card is changed to &lsqb;copy&rsqb; and &lsqb;copy&rsqb; is determined. If a NO is output at step ST<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, other processing that the aforementioned processings is carried out at step ST<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and then the processing proceeds to the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to this embodiment, when the card data is turned over, printed out and recorded on the record medium or when the power source is turned OFF, the name of the writer who writes the card data is displayed so that the writer who describes the card data can be known immediately. Further, in the copied card data, the name of the writer who writes the card data is erased and changed into &lsqb;copy&rsqb;. Thus, it can be determined immediately whether the card data is the true card data or the copied card data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (formed of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> drawn on two sheets of drawings so as to permit the use of a suitably large scale) is a flowchart to which references will be made in explaining an operation in which a time is recorded when data is recorded on a record medium such as a floppy disk or the like, when data is printed out, when the power switch is turned OFF and when data of the determined page is copied. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, like parts corresponding to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are marked with the same references and therefore need not be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, steps STE<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and STE<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> correspond to steps ST<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, ST<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and ST<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In steps STE<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, STE<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and STE<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a value of present time from the timer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is written in the determined page at its corresponding recording position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</cross-reference> show card data in which a time <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the determined page is written. Further, in steps STE<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and STE<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the determined page is copied and a present time from the timer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is written in the copied page at its corresponding recording position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows the condition such that a current time <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at which the determined page is copied is written in each card data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned arrangement, even when the user receives card data (page data) by means of electronic mail, a FAX communication, IC card and so on and mixes the received card data with owner&apos;s card data, it is possible for the user to know clearly when and from whom the card data is sent, that is, those who sent the card data and the time at which data is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While the copy of owner&apos;s signature and the writing of time are independently performed in the aforementioned embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C, 4D</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E, the above operations may be performed at the same time. Further, it is needless to say that not only the time but also date may be registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the input of data is not limited to the pen <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and data may be input to the apparatus by utilizing a keyboard and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As set out above, according to the present invention, if any data is written in card data when the user opens the check page and the write page, the signature, sign, pen name or the like of the writer who writes the data is recorded and date and time when card data is determined are also recorded, thus making it possible for the user to know clearly the writer&apos;s name and time and date of the recording. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the information processing apparatus of the present invention, it is possible for the user to know the time when card data is copied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Having described a preferred embodiment of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to that precise embodiment and that various changes and modifications thereof could be effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the novel concepts of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
