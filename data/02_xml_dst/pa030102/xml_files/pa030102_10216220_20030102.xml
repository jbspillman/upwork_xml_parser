<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process cartridge and an electrophotographic image forming apparatus. In this specification, an electrophotographic image forming apparatus means such an apparatus that records images on recording media using an electrophotographic image formation system. The examples of electrophotographic image forming apparatuses include electrophotographic copying machines, electrophotographic printers (laser printers, LED printers, and the like), facsimile apparatuses, word processors, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A process cartridge means: a cartridge in which a charging means, a developing means or a cleaning means, and an electrophotographic photosensitive member, are integrally placed, and which is enabled to be removably installed in the main assembly of an image forming apparatus; a cartridge in which at least one among a charging means, a developing means, and a cleaning means, and an electrophotographic photosensitive member, are integrally placed, and which is enabled to be removably installed in the main assembly of an image forming apparatus; or a cartridge in which at least a developing means and an electrophotographic photosensitive member are integrally placed, and which is enabled to be removably installed in the main assembly of an image forming apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the past, an electrophotographic image forming apparatus which employs an electrophotographic image forming process has been employing a process cartridge system, according to which an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a single or plural processing means which act on the electrophotographic photosensitive member, are integrally placed in a cartridge removably installable in the main assembly of an image forming apparatus. This process cartridge system makes it possible for a user to maintain the apparatus without relying on maintenance personnel, drastically improving operational efficiency. Thus, the process cartridge system has been widely used in the field of image forming apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A process cartridge is provided with an information storing means in which the history or specification values of the process cartridge are registered. The information storing means is enabled to communicate with the main assembly of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus so that the maintenance of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus main assembly and the process cartridge can be simplified or image quality can be improved. Some process cartridges are provided with a connector or the like which connects the electrophotographic image forming apparatus main assembly to the information storing means of the process cartridge. In order to eliminate the need for a mechanical connector which tends to increase the cartridge size, it has been considered to employ a noncontact communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in the case of a process cartridge employing a wireless communication system, the aforementioned information storing means is affected by the electrical noises generated by the processing members, for example, a charge roller, a development sleeve, and a transfer roller of the apparatus main assembly, to which bias is applied from the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. Therefore, there is a chance that the contents of the information storing means will be destroyed or written over with erroneous information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present information is one of the results of the further development of the above described conventional technologies. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the appended drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a process cartridge will be described along with an electrophotographic image forming apparatus in which a process cartridge is removably installable. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus (laser beam printer) in which a process cartridge has been installed, and depicts the general structure of the apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a process cartridge, and depicts the general structure thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As for the order of descriptions, first, the general structure of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus in which a process cartridge has been installed will be described, and then, the structure of a process cartridge will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (General Structure) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this electrophotographic image forming apparatus A (laser beam printer) is such an apparatus that forms an image on recording media (for example, recording paper, OHP sheet, fabric, and the like) with the use of an electrophotographic image formation process. In operation, it forms a toner image (developer image) on an electrophotographic photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, &ldquo;photosensitive drum&rdquo;) in the form of a drum. More specifically, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is charged by a charging means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and then, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is exposed to a laser beam projected onto the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from an optical means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while being modulated with image formation information, to form an electrostatic latent image in accordance with the image formation information, on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The thus formed electrostatic latent image is developed into a toner image by a developing means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having been placed in a cassette <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is conveyed by a conveying means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprising a pickup roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a combination <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a feed roller and retard roller, two pairs <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of conveying rollers, and the like, while being turned over, in synchronism with the toner image formation. Next, the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the process cartridge B is transferred onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by applying voltage (transfer bias) to a transfer roller <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a transferring means with which the main assembly A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, &ldquo;image forming apparatus main assembly&rdquo;) of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus is provided. The transfer roller <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the linear interface between the two rollers becomes parallel to the longitudinal direction (axial line direction) of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as the process cartridge B is installed into the image forming apparatus main assembly A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After receiving the toner image, the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is conveyed to a fixing means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by a conveyer belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The fixing means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a driver roller <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a rotational fixing member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The rotational fixing member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a cylindrical sheet, and contains a heater. It is rotatably supported by a supporting member. The fixing means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> applies pressure and heat to the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to fix the transferred toner image to the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is passing through the fixing means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is conveyed through a reversing path, and discharged into a delivery tray <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, by two pairs <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>of discharge rollers. The aforementioned optical means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a laser diode, a polygon mirror, a lens, and a refection mirror, although they are not illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (Process Cartridge Structure) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The process cartridge B is such a cartridge that is provided with an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and at least one processing means. As for processing means, there are a charging means for charging an electrophotographic photosensitive member, a developing means for developing an electrostatic latent image formed on an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a cleaning means for cleaning the toner particles remaining on the peripheral surface of an electrophotographic photosensitive member, for example. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the process cartridge B in this embodiment, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with a photosensitive layer is rotated, and while it is rotated, its peripheral surface is uniformly charged by the voltage (charge bias) applied to a primary charge roller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, &ldquo;charge roller&rdquo;) as a charging means. Then, a laser beam modulated with the image formation information from the optical means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is projected upon the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through an exposure opening (unillustrated) to form an electrostatic latent image. This electrostatic latent image is developed by the developing means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which uses toner. More specifically, the charge roller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is placed in contact with the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the longitudinal axes of the two components become parallel to each other. As charge bias is applied to the charge roller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the image forming apparatus main assembly A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is charged. The charge roller <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> rotates by following the rotation of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The developing means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> supplies the development region of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with toner to develop the electrostatic image formed on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The developing means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> sends the toner within the toner container <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> toward a development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the rotation of a toner conveying member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Further, it rotates the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in which a stationary magnet is contained, and forms a layer of toner on the peripheral surface of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while triboelectrically charging the toner, by a development blade <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The triboelectrically charged toner on the peripheral surface of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is supplied to the development region of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with a pair of spacer rings <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>as a gap maintaining means, which are fitted one for one around the longitudinal (axial direction) end portions of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and remain in contact with the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the longitudinal ends of the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, maintaining a predetermined distance between the peripheral surfaces of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In operation, development bias is applied from the image forming apparatus main assembly A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that the toner on the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is transferred onto the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in accordance with the pattern of the aforementioned electrostatic latent image to form a toner image, or a visual image. The development blade <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is a blade for regulating the amount of the toner on the peripheral surface of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as well as for charging the toner. In the adjacencies of the development sleeve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a toner stirring member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>for recirculating the toner within the development chamber is rotatably mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> After the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is transferred onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by applying voltage (transfer bias) opposite in polarity to the toner image, to the transfer roller <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the toner particles remaining on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are removed by the cleaning means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the cleaning means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> scrapes the toner particles remaining on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, down into the waste toner bin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>by the rubber cleaning blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>attached to the longitudinal tip portion of a cleaning blade holding member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.
