<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof and, more particularly, to a wiring pattern in a region where wiring lines with different pitches are connected, a forming method thereof, and a semiconductor pattern exposure mask used in that method. The present invention is applied to, e.g., a boundary region between a memory cell array region, and a memory cell peripheral circuit region of a semiconductor memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a common practice to use photolithography in the manufacture of semiconductor devices such as a semiconductor memory, microprocessor, and the like. Photolithography is a technique for irradiating a pattern exposure mask formed with a pattern with light rays, projecting the light rays onto a photoresist on a semiconductor substrate via an optical system to expose the photoresist, and transferring the pattern on the mask onto the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Miniaturization of semiconductor devices is in progress to achieve high integration and low cost. For this purpose, miniaturization of a pattern formed by photolithography must be realized first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, a resolution R and depth of focus DOF in photolithography are expressed by Rayleigh&apos;s equations:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>R&equals;k</italic></highlight>1(&lgr;/<highlight><italic>NA</italic></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>DOF&equals;k</italic></highlight>2(&lgr;/<highlight><italic>NA</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> where &lgr;: the wavelength of irradiation light, NA: the numerical aperture, and k1 and k2: process constants and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the above equations, it is effective to shorten the wavelength of irradiation light so as to transfer a fine pattern. As a light source of a conventional exposure system, i-line having a wavelength of 365 nm is normally used. In order to form a finer pattern, a KrF excimer laser having a wavelength of 248 nm is currently normally used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to promote further miniaturization, it is required to use a light source of a shorter wavelength, to decrease k1 and k2, and to increase the numerical aperture NA (high NA). As the light source of a short wavelength, an ArF excimer laser having a wavelength of 193 nm is hopeful. However, it is difficult to develop an optical system, photoresist, and the like for the ArF excimer laser, and such system has not reached a practical use yet. Although k1 and k2 can be reduced by improving the resist and process, their limit values are around 0.4 to 0.5. Too high an NA is not practical since it is difficult to work a high-NA lens that can cover a large area upon exposure. In addition, a certain depth of focus or more must be assured in actual exposure. However, since the depth of focus drops with increasing NA, as can be seen from the Rayleigh&apos;s equations, it is difficult to achieve a high NA in this respect as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As described above, improvement of resolution achievable by only improving the wavelength, numerical aperture, and process is limited. Hence, so-called super resolution techniques such as a method using an attenuated phase shifting mask, a method using off-axis illumination upon exposure of a mask pattern, and the like are used as that for further improving resolution. The super resolution technique will be briefly explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the attenuated phase shifting mask, a translucent film having a transmittance of 3 to 10% is normally formed in place of a chromium film to transmit light so as not to perfectly intercept light even at a line pattern portion, and the phase of transmission light is shifted 180&deg;. At this time, the resolution is improved by forming a steep light intensity distribution at the boundaries between line and space patterns by coherence produced between light transmitted through the line pattern portion and that transmitted through the space pattern portion. By contrast, in a normal mask, a line pattern portion is normally formed of chromium or the like to intercept light so as to prevent the photoresist from being exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In off-axis illumination, an aperture that intercepts light components near the center of a light source is set to irradiate a mask with only obliquely incoming light components. When such off-axis illumination is used, either of &plusmn;1st-order diffracted light components are not projected, and the remaining diffracted light component is projected. In this way, the resolution can be improved by the method of forming an image using two luminous fluxes, i.e., 0th-order light and one of &plusmn;1st-order diffracted light components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By contrast, in a normal illumination method, light which is emitted by a light source and with which a mask is irradiated forms an optical image on a semiconductor substrate since three luminous fluxes, i.e., 0th-order light and &plusmn;1st-order light components produced by diffraction are projected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, the aforementioned super resolution technique is effective to form periodic, dense patterns but can hardly form coarse patterns simultaneously with dense patterns. That is, it is possible to miniaturize patterns on a memory cell array region using the super resolution technique, but it is difficult to form desired patterns on a wiring connection region between the memory cell array region and a peripheral circuit region. In some cases, the patterns of the connection region limit the pitch of a memory cell array, resulting in an increase in chip size of a semiconductor memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As described above, in a conventional semiconductor memory, the resolution and depth of focus readily impair due to coherence of light upon forming wiring patterns using photolithography on a boundary region between a memory cell array region where line &amp; space wiring patterns are formed at a very small pitch equal to or lower than the wavelength of a light source of an exposure system, and a peripheral circuit region where wiring patterns are formed at a patch larger than that in the former region. As a result, desired patterns cannot be formed, and disconnection and short-circuiting of wiring patterns readily occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is the first object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device which can prevent disconnection and short-circuiting of wiring patterns in a region where wiring lines or interconnects with different pitches are to be connected, and can achieve high integration. More specifically, the present invention has as its object to suppress the resolution and depth of focus from impairing upon forming wiring patterns using photolithography in the boundary region between a first region where line &amp; space wiring patterns are formed via very small spaces equal to or smaller than the wavelength of a light source of an exposure system, and a second region where wiring patterns are formed via spaces larger than those of the first region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is the second object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device, which can suppress any errors due to dimensional variations at the memory cell array edge portion of a semiconductor memory device and can realize high yield and high reliability, and its manufacturing method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Prior to a description of embodiments, problems in a connection region between a memory cell region and peripheral circuit region of a semiconductor memory device will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a general pattern layout of a semiconductor memory device. Peripheral circuit regions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that drive a memory cell array are laid out to surround a memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Gate lines, metal wiring lines, and the like of the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are normally formed by dense patterns such as simple line &amp; space patterns aligned periodically, but those of each peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed by patterns coarser than the memory cell array region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The gate lines and metal wiring lines on each peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed by patterns more complicated than the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> although they have periodicity to some extent. The gate lines and metal wiring lines on the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> run to outside the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and are connected to those of each peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> However, on each connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> between the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, since very fine line &amp; space patterns in the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> continue to run, and the periodicity of patterns is disturbed, the resolution and depth of focus on the connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> readily impair. As a result, desired patterns cannot be formed, resulting in disconnection and short-circuiting of wiring lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a pattern exposure mask formed with a wiring pattern which connects the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and each peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wiring patterns having a line width L, line space S, and pitch (L&plus;S) are formed on the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, wiring patterns having a pitch 2&times;(L&plus;S) are formed on the peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and wiring patterns for connecting, e.g., odd-numbered wiring patterns of the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to wiring patterns of the peripheral circuit region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed on the connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this case, one-end portions of the remaining (even) wiring patterns of the memory cell array region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> terminate on a boundary with the connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and their other-end portions are connected to wiring patterns (not shown) used to connect another peripheral circuit region. The line width of each wiring pattern on the connection region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> changes in two steps, and the change positions of the respective wiring patterns are on an identical line or collinear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the simulation results of a resist pattern obtained upon exposing the resist on a semiconductor substrate using the pattern exposure mask shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Note that the resist patterns are obtained by computing light intensity distributions, and plotting the distribution of equal intensities. Also, three lines in the resist pattern indicate a resist pattern at a light intensity at which designed wiring dimensions can be obtained, and those at light intensities at which designed wiring dimensions vary &plusmn;10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As the simulation computation conditions, the line width and line space of wiring lines on a semiconductor substrate are 0.15 &mgr;m on the semiconductor substrate, a KrF excimer laser having a wavelength &lgr;&equals;248 nm is used as a light source, the numerical aperture NA&equals;0.6 and coherence factor &sgr;&equals;0.75 are set, and annular illumination that covers the central portion of the light source (covers &frac23; the light source at an area ratio) is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Also, as the pattern exposure mask, an attenuated phase shifting mask which has a transmittance of 6% and rotates the phase of light 180&deg; is used. In order to check if an intended depth of focus can be assured, we assumed that exposure is done under the condition with a defocus of 0.4 &mgr;m from the best focus position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> However, as can be seen from a simulation result with the smallest line width of the three simulation results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, i</cross-reference>.e., when the exposure amount has a 10% increase from an optimal value, a wiring line disconnects (indicated within a circle D). That is, wiring lines may disconnect due to variations of the exposure amount, resist sensitivity, and the like in actual exposure, thus causing operation errors. The reason why a desired pattern is not formed at a position where the periodicity of a wiring line is disturbed is that diffracted light produced at the terminal end portion of the wiring line or a position where the line width of the wiring line changes influences neighboring patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned problems, and embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a partial plan view of a mask pattern formed on a semiconductor device pattern exposure mask according to the first embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a partial enlarged view of the mask pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The mask pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> is a pattern exposure mask of a semiconductor memory. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a first mask region corresponding to a memory cell array region; <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a second mask region corresponding to a peripheral circuit region; and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a third mask region corresponding to a boundary region (connection region) between the memory cell array region and peripheral circuit region. Also, hatched portions indicate opaque portions (opaque patterns), and blank portions indicate transparent portions. These portions are respectively used to transfer line and space patterns onto a semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed with a first line &amp; space pattern set in which first, second, third, and fourth line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> each having a line width L are aligned in turn via line spaces S (wiring pitch&equals;L&plus;S), and at least two sets of these line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> repeat themselves periodically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The second mask region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with a second line &amp; space pattern set in which fifth and sixth line patterns 121 and 122 each having a line width L or more are aligned via a line space S or more, and at least two sets of these line patterns <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> periodically repeat themselves (pitch&equals;4(L&plus;S)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> One-end portions of the first and third line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> run to be connected to the fifth and sixth line patterns <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the second mask region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via seventh and eighth line patterns <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> on the third mask region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> By contrast, the second line pattern <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> terminates at the boundary position between the first and third mask regions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The fourth line pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> runs to and terminates at the boundary position between the third and second mask regions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the seventh line pattern <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> connected to the first and fifth line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the eighth line pattern <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> connected to the third and sixth line patterns <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the fourth line pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are aligned on the third mask region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Note that third and second mask regions (not shown) are present at the other end side of the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (on the side opposite to the third mask region) to be symmetric to the third and second mask regions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The other-end portions of the first and third line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and 113 on the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> terminate in the third mask region (not shown). The other-end portions of the second and fourth line patterns <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> run to be connected to line patterns of the second mask region (not shown) via the third mask region (not shown). In this way, all the line patterns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to the second mask regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the seventh line pattern <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed so that its line width changes stepwise in the middle of its lengthwise direction in the third mask region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the line width on the side of the fifth line pattern <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> thickens stepwise compared to that on the side of the first line pattern <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the eighth line pattern <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is formed so that its line width changes stepwise in the middle of its lengthwise direction in the third mask region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the line width on the side of the sixth line pattern <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> thickens stepwise compared to that on the third line pattern <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The stepwise change position of the line width of each of the seventh and eighth line patterns <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be separated S or more in the lengthwise direction from the boundary position between the third and first regions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and L or more in the lengthwise direction from the boundary position between the third and second mask regions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the first line pattern <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> runs into the third mask region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a portion of the distance S in the pattern lengthwise direction as a portion of the seventh line pattern <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, while its line width remains the same, and the line width of the seventh line pattern <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> increases at the portion of the distance S. Likewise, the third line pattern <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> runs into the third mask region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a portion of the distance S in the pattern lengthwise direction as a portion of the eighth line pattern <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, while its line width remains the same, and the line width of the eighth line pattern <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> increases at the portion of the distance S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The fourth line pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the first mask region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> runs parallel to the seventh and eighth line patterns <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> while its line width L remains the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Note that the stepwise change position of the line width of each of the seventh and eighth line patterns <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may be separated more than S from the boundary position between the third and first mask regions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, if this distance is too large, the pattern area increases, and this undesirably results in high cost of a semiconductor device to be manufactured. Hence, it is appropriate to set the distance to this portion to be S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned mask pattern, the minimum space on the mask is S, and this minimum space S on the mask preferably matches a minimum space S of line &amp; space patterns. The reason for this will be explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the manufacturing process of a mask, a mask pattern may differ from a desired one due to dust or the like. Hence, after the pattern is formed on the mask, it must be inspected for the presence/absence of defects. Since defect inspection is done by an inspection device using light such as a laser microscope or the like, the size of a pattern that can be inspected is limited by the wavelength of the light source of the inspection device. In order to perfectly execute defect inspection, pattern dimensions must assume large values to some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In a mask used to simultaneously form a memory cell array region and peripheral circuit regions, a pattern having the smallest size in a given mask corresponds to that in a memory cell array region. Therefore, when the wiring line width and wiring spaces of all patterns in the mask are adjusted to those in the memory cell array region, the mask can be perfectly inspected for any defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> After the gate lines and wiring lines of a semiconductor memory device are formed, pattern portions corresponding to line spaces of the mask are buried by an insulating interlayer later. At this time, if the space between gate lines or wiring lines is too small, the insulating interlayer cannot often be buried in this portion. As a result, foreign matter may remain in this portion, and may cause operation errors of a memory. In this manner, in order to perfectly bury the insulating interlayer, the spaces between gate lines and wiring lines are preferably adjusted to the minimum space of the memory cell array region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Since photolithography normally uses reduction projection exposure, the dimension of the mask pattern assumes a value four or five times larger than those of a resist pattern formed on a semiconductor substrate. That is, the dimension of a mask used to form a resist pattern of, e.g., 0.15 &mgr;m is 0.6 &mgr;m or 0.75 &mgr;m. In the following description, the dimensions of the mask pattern are equal to those of the resist pattern for the sake of simplicity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> More specifically, simulation computations are made under the condition that the line width and line space of line patterns corresponding to those of the mask are 0.15 &mgr;m on the semiconductor substrate, a KrF excimer laser having a wavelength &lgr;&equals;248 nm is used as the light source, the numerical aperture NA&equals;0.6 and coherent factor &sgr;&equals;0.75 are set, annular illumination that covers the central portion of the light source, and an attenuated phase shifting mask which has a transmittance of 6% and rotates the phase of light 180&deg; is used as the opaque portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In actual exposure, steps caused by different stage heights of an exposure system, warp of a semiconductor substrate, and the like, and a defocus caused by steps on a substrate and the like must be taken into consideration, and the computations are made with a defocus of 0.4 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

Compared to the conventional resist patterns shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, since the terminal end portions and line width change portions of the wiring lines are separated by appropriate distances, neighboring wiring patterns are free from any influences of diffracted light produced at those portions. Therefore, when a pattern is actually formed by exposure on a semiconductor substrate using the mask pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> sufficiently large process margin can be assured, and a high-quality wiring pattern can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The problems of the conventional nonvolatile semiconductor memory device will be discussed below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference> show principal part of a pattern on a reticle used in the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</cross-reference>, in which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</cross-reference> corresponds to a reticle used to transfer the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</cross-reference> onto the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28B</cross-reference> corresponds to a reticle used to transfer the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</cross-reference> onto the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> For example, the reticle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</cross-reference> is formed with a line &amp; space pattern having a line width L1 and space T1. Process margins for the exposure amount and a focus of the exposure system near the memory cell array edge portion are smaller than those of the array internal portion, and it is difficult to form a desired pattern. For example, when the exposure amount or the focus of the exposure system varies, a pattern near the memory cell array edge portion suffers larger dimensional variations than that of the array internal portion. Especially, when the super resolution technique is used, that tendency is notable. For this reason, it is a common practice to set a memory cell located at the memory cell array edge portion or a plurality of memory cells located near the array edge portion to be dummy cells which are not electrically used. In this way, dimensional variations near the array edge portion are allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> However, in practice, dimensional variations near the array edge portion may cause the following errors in the memory cell array. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</cross-reference>, and corresponds to the same process as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</cross-reference>. In case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the array edge portion is formed thinner than other patterns <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. This pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the array edge has poor stability due to its thinness, and may collapse in a later process. For example, if this pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>collapses in the development process after exposure, etching is done using the pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that has collapsed as an etching mask and, as a result, a wrong pattern is formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Conversely, a photoresist pattern at the array edge portion may be formed thicker than other patterns due to errors of the exposure amount or focus of the exposure system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A, and corresponds to the same process as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A, and corresponds to a process after etching in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. In case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30, a</cross-reference> photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the array edge portion is formed thicker than other patterns <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In this case, when the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is removed using the photoresist patterns <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as an etching mask, and the buffer oxide film <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are removed using the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the width of a trench <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the array edge portion becomes smaller than those of trenches <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the array internal portion, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. Upon burying an insulating film in these trenches <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the trench <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with a smaller width is often insufficiently buried compared to other trenches <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. As a result, dust may be produced in a later process, or the control gate electrodes <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> may short-circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, formation of the trenches <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> poses another problem. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A, and corresponds to the same process as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the manufacturing process of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A, and corresponds to the same process as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the width of an element region <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the array edge portion is formed larger than those of other element regions <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The layout of the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is displaced due to misalignment or the like of a reticle. As a result, a space for the pattern <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is located above the element region <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>When the conductive material is etched using this photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and element region <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are etched to form a substrate damage portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, resulting in errors. Furthermore, since process margins for variations of the exposure value and focus are small at the array edge portion, the aforementioned phenomenon is more pronounced. </paragraph>

Each floating gate <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is split at a position above an isolation region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and is isolated for each memory cell <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. A plurality of control gate electrodes <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are formed above the plurality of floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> via an inter-gate insulating film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. A plurality of memory cells <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> form vertical and horizontal arrays, and the control gate electrodes <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of memory cells <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> which neighbor across the isolation region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are connected to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In the seventh embodiment, the width of the isolation region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is set to satisfy the following condition. That is, let T1 be the width of an isolation region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the memory cell array edge portion, and T2 be the width of the isolation region in the memory cell array internal portion.

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Note that a memory cell at the memory cell array edge portion is normally used as a dummy cell which is not electrically used. In the seventh embodiment, as can be seen from inequalities (1) and (2) above, since the occupation area of the dummy cell increases than that in the conventional device, the area of the memory cell array may increase accordingly. However, the memory cell array includes a very larger number of memory cells, and a slight increase in area at the memory cell array edge portion is very small relative to the area of the overall array. Hence, an increase in occupation area of the dummy cell at the array edge portion does not lead to an increase in area of the entire memory cell array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> A method of manufacturing the nonvolatile semiconductor device according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</cross-reference> will be explained below using FIGS. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (with suffices A and B).

Of course, before the buffer oxide film <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> are stacked, a well region may be formed in the surface portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In the seventh to 11th embodiments, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34, 41</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (with suffices A and B), the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> at the memory cell array edge portion is completely removed if it is located at a position outside the array. However, the present invention is not limited to such specific structure. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A and 51B</cross-reference>, the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may remain even at a position <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> outside the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Since the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A and 51B</cross-reference> is substantially the same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A and 41B</cross-reference> except for the floating gate electrode at the memory cell array edge portion (at the position <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> outside the array), a detailed description thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The seventh to 12th embodiments have been explained taking a NAND nonvolatile semiconductor memory device as an example.

<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In the seventh to 12th embodiments, a positive type resist, the exposed portion of which becomes a space of the photoresist is used. Alternatively, a negative type resist, the exposed portion of which becomes a line of the photoresist may be used. In this case, the reticle pattern according to each embodiment can be reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the reticle according to the seventh to 12th embodiments, its opaque portion may use chromium or the like that perfectly intercepts light, or an attenuated phase shifting mask that transmits some light components or changes the phase of incoming light. Also, an alternating phase shifting mask having different phases of neighboring line patterns may be used. </paragraph>
