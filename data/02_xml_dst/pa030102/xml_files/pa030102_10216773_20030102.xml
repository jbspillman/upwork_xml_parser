<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of managing freight information for performing freight transportation from a consignor to a consignee and a freight management system and more particularly, to a freight information management method and a freight management system which use a contactless information readable IC card as an electronic tag and have many freight loading/unloading base stations so as to be suitable for wide area transport requiring quick and accurate transportation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In mixed freight transportation services for transport of mixed freight goods of many consignors, as represented by door to door delivery, freight goods are transported from a consignor to a consignee through many stages of base stations. Under the circumstances, with a view to improving the quality of transport service including prevention of irregular conditions such as loss of freight, misunderstood delivery destination and damage, the freight pursuit intending to precisely catch the pass history of freight at each base station is of significant importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> At the present-day practical level, a system using a bar code has been used widely as a means for realizing the freight pursuit. In the bar code system, the freight pursuit is carried out by printing a bar code indicative of a freight number on a freight slip and reading the bar code on the slip attached to the freight at each pass base station. But, in the bar code system, it is necessary for reading the bar code to align the direction of the freight goods and to scan for read of information freight by freight. Further, technical restrictions are encountered in which only initially registered information can be held or the capacity of information which can be held is small. Consequently, acquisition work of freight pass information is laborious and time-consuming, raising a problem that perfect automation of freight control such as sorting is difficult to achieve without resort to manual labor. Further, owing to these problems, there arises other fatal problems from the standpoint of freight pursuit that a time lag occurs between acquired freight history information and actual freight transit or items in the freight history information are insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To solve these problems, a freight information management method has been studied recently, according to which an electronic freight slip (electronic tag) utilizing an IC card capable of storing a great amount of information and writing and reading information in a contactless fashion is used in place of the freight slip printed with a bar code. Such a technique as above is described in, for example, JP-A-4-341414. In the literature, when delivery information is stored in an electronic tag in response to an inquiry signal from an electronic reader/writer installed in a truck in a navigation system using the electronic tag and adapted to transmit stored delivery information, the position information of a delivery destination is inputted on longitude and latitude corresponding to GPS information. On the other hand, the truck detects its vehicle position by means of a GPS (Global Positioning System) to display its present position in the form of a present position indication mark on a navigation map displayed on an indicator of a navigation unit and at the same time, displays on the navigation map, as delivery destination, position information of the delivery destination contained in the delivery information read out of the electronic tag and inputted to the navigation unit. According to JP-A-4-341414 as above, even an unexperienced door to door delivery worker can set a delivery route as exactly as an experienced worker does and delivery miss and missing delivery can be prevented. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the transport information management method using the electronic tag, its application range is not limited to the method applied to navigation and the electronic tag can be utilized effectively by solving problems as below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) When collection request information or the like is written into the electronic tag at a consignor destination, there arises a practical problem that installation conditions in the information system at the consignor destination differ including a site where an electronic reader/writer can be installed, a site where an IC card reader/writer can be installed and a site where only a bar code label printer can be installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) When a request for changing the delivery destination/date occurs, a plurality of freight goods exist in one order (called lot) or special freight goods such as fragile or precision machinery and instruments are handled, there arises a problem as to how use of the electronic tag should be made in the case as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (3) There arises a problem as to how the electronic tag should be utilized in order to quickly deal with irregular conditions such as erroneous arrival, erroneous loading, left-out freight, nonarrival freight and over loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a freight information management method which can realize freight transportation with high efficiency by using, as an electronic tag, a contactless information readable storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in a freight information management system having a consignor destination system installed at a consignor destination, base station systems respectively provided at a plurality of base stations a dealer in delivering freight collected from the consignor destination to a consignee, a consignee destination system provided at a consignee destination, a freight information overall management system connected with the base station systems, and an electronic tag attached to the freight to be delivered and being capable of electronically storing freight information necessary for delivery, a collection request inputted by the consignor destination system is recorded on the electronic tag attached to the freight and transmitted to a collection management system in a base station system so as to be received thereby. During collection of the freight, information concerning the collection is recorded on the electronic tag by means of a terminal unit and the collection information is transmitted to the collection management system. The base station system informs the freight information overall management system of the collection information and information concerning the freight passing through the base station. The freight information overall management system acquires a transport history of the freight on the basis of the information sent from an in-base station freight information system and calculates a delivery schedule of the freight and informs it to each in-base station freight information management system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, in the freight information management system using electronic tags, when an electronic reader/writer is provided at the consignor destination, collection request information and an arrival store name are written into an electronic tag in advance by means of the electronic reader/writer at the consignor destination but when the reader/writer for electronic tag is not provided at the consignor destination, collection request information received at a base station system is stored in a terminal unit used by a collector in charge and the collection request information precedently inputted in a terminal unit is written into an electronic tag at the consignor destination. In the course of transportation of the freight, freight transport history information such as arrival base station name, work end date and person in charge of work is written into the electronic tag by means of the electronic tag reader/writer connected to the aforementioned portable terminal, a on-vehicle terminal or a sorting unit at an end of unloading, sorting or loading work in each base station, so that the freight transport history of each freight may be caught precisely with reality. By comparing the freight transport history information with freight arrival schedule information and the collection information such as special freight handling and appointed delivery date, quick handling of the freight transport and irregular conditions can be realized on the aforementioned practical level.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereunder in greater detail by way of example of mixed freight transportation services in which freight goods are transported under mixed loading of a plurality of shippers from a consignor to a consignee. Generally, in case of mixed freight transportation, transport freight is delivered from a consignor destination to a consignee via many stages of base stations including a departure store, a departure transit store, an arrival transit store and an arrival store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the function and the overall flow of mixed freight transportation services according to an embodiment of the present invention. The participant in the mixed freight transportation services includes a consignor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An individual, an enterprise or the like entrusting transportation of freight comes under the consignor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> possesses base stations such as departure store <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, departure transit store <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, arrival transit store <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and arrival store <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a freight information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, collection vehicles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, transit vehicles <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and delivery vehicles <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and contracts transportation services. The consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> corresponds to an individual or enterprise receiving freight. Generally, a plurality of consignors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and consignees <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are involved. The overall flow of the mixed freight transportation services will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the consignor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes a request for collection to the carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (collection request process <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) and the carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives the request (request reception process <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). Based on this, the carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes a collection vehicle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to make the rounds of a plurality of consignor destinations so as to collect freight goods to be transported at individual consignor destinations (collected freight acceptance process <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>). The collected freight goods are carried back to the departure store <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and unloaded from the collection vehicle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (unloading process <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the freight goods are sorted in accordance with destinations (sorting process <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>), loaded on a transit vehicle <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (loading process <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) and then transported to the next base station. During unloading <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, it is checked whether appointed freight goods correctly reach the departure store <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (nonarrival freight check process <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as in the departure store <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the unloading <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, sorting <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, loading <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and nonarrival freight check <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are carried out in each of the base stations of the departure transit store <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, arrival transit store <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and arrival store <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in this order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> After being loaded <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> onto a delivery vehicle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the arrival store <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the freight goods are transported to consignee destinations <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and are handed over at the individual consignee destinations <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (delivered freight hand-over process <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>). At that time, in case a consignee is absent and the freight cannot be handed over, the freight is carried back to the arrival store <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and kept in custody (custody process <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>). Then, the loading <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, delivery transportation and delivered freight hand-over <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are repeated at suitable timings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> During the collected freight acceptance <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the unloading <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, sorting <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, loading <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and delivered freight hand-over <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> at each base station, freight information such as freight pass time is registered in the information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (freight information register process <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). Further, on the basis of the freight information registered at the time of collected freight acceptance <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the freight information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> informs the consignor of freight information such as delivery schedule time (delivery scheduled freight information informing process <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and delivery scheduled freight information confirming process <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) and informs each base station of freight information such as arrival schedule time (arrival scheduled freight information informing process <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and arrival scheduled freight information confirming process <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>). In addition, when hand-over of the freight to the consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is correctly carried out on the basis of the freight information registered at the time of delivered freight hand-over, the freight information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> gives information to this effect to the consignor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (delivery finish informing process <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and delivery finish confirming process <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>) but when hand-over of the freight cannot be carried out correctly because of absence of the consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, gives information to this effect to the consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (absence notice process <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and absence notice confirming process <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above function, the mixed freight transportation services have the function of responding to inquiries about requests from the consignor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, consignee <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and each base station so as to cause the freight information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to offer to the requesters various kinds of information such as attribute information and pass time information concerning freight about which the inquiries are made (freight information offer process <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and freight information inquiry process <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>), the function of handling requests for change of the delivery destination and delivery time for the consignee (delivery destination/date change requesting process <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and delivery destination/date change handling process <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>), and the function of causing each base station to catch the freight information without resort to connection to the freight information management center <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (individual freight information confirming process <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the overall construction of a system for realizing, in the present embodiment, various kinds of functions at the consignor destination, each base station and freight information management center of the carrier and the consignee destination shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>.

Thereafter, in the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a process for register of order information is carried out by the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a detailed flow chart of the order information register process. In the order information register process (step <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>), it is first examined whether the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the bar code label printer (step <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>). If the reader/writer type is the bar code label printer, the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> converts the collection request number included in the collection request answer received in the step <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> into a bar code form and issues a bar code label <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, thus ending the process. Then, the consignor attaches the printed label <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the corresponding freight. In case there are a plurality of freight goods in connection with one order, the consignor attaches the bar code label <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to representative freight (step <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the reader/writer type is determined not to be the bar code label printer in the step <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> uses, as the key, the consignee address <highlight><bold>1338</bold></highlight> included in the collection request information stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to retrieve an address classified arrival store name DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in advance, thereby determining an arrival store name. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an example of the address classified arrival store name DB. In the address classified arrival store name DB <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight>, arrival store names <highlight><bold>1720</bold></highlight> having service ranges covering addresses <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> in a region where the freight transportation services are offered are registered in respect of the individual addresses (step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, it is examined whether the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the electronic tag reader/writer (step <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight>). If the reader/writer type is not the electronic tag reader/writer, the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> held in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the arrival store name settled in the step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight> are registered in the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> precedently distributed to the consignor destination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by using the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When the reader/writer type is determined to be the electronic tag reader/writer in the step <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight>, the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the arrival store name determined in the step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight> are registered in a basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> precedently distributed to the consignor destination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by using the electronic reader/writer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to read the freight number precedently registered in the basis electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and stores it in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Further, the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> examines whether the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> contained in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> held in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is not less than two and when the number is less than 2, it ends the process (step <highlight><bold>1570</bold></highlight>). If the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> is not less than 2, the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> stores an initial value of 2, as the lot number, in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The lot number is a number for definitely defining individual freight goods when a freight lot prevails in which a plurality of freight goods exist for one order (step <highlight><bold>1575</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, the processor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to register the collection request information stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the arrival store name determined in the step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight> as well as the freight number registered in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and the lot number in a precedently distributed lot electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. At that time, the lot number in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is added with 1 (step <highlight><bold>1580</bold></highlight>). Next, it is examined whether the lot number exceeds the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> and when the lot number is larger than the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>, the process ends but when this does not stand, the program proceeds to the step <highlight><bold>1580</bold></highlight> and register operation into the lot electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is caused to continue (step <highlight><bold>1590</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

The portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> stores the received collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and delivers it to the output unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The collector in charge (driver) carries out the collection work by utilizing the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the flow of a process which is mainly performed in the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> during the collected freight acceptance process <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> carried out by the collector in charge at the consignor destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the collected freight acceptance process <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, information stored in an IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> precedently distributed to the consignor destination <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is read by using the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and written into the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, special charge rule <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, utilization cost history <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight> and electronic money balance <highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight> are stored in a memory inside the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. The special charge rule <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> includes, for example, a rule such as discount rule <highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight> used for calculation of a cost for &ldquo;when the utilization cost total for this month exceeds 100000 yen, the discount rate is 0.9&rdquo;. The special charge rule <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> can be different for different consignors.

In the electronic money balance <highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight>, an electronic money balance when the IC card <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is provided with the electronic money function is recorded (step <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, when the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the electronic tag reader/writer, collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> for one order stored in a basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> attached to freight and an arrival store name are written into the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by means of the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. When the order is for a freight lot, only collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> stored in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> may be written. In case the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the IC card reader/writer, collection request information stored in the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> and an arrival store name are written, for one order, into the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by using the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, by using the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> corresponding to the written order is erased from the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. In case the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the bar code label printer, a bar code label <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is first read by using the bar code reader/writer <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Then, by using a collection request number read from the bar code label <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> as the key, collection request numbers stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are retrieved and collection request information corresponding to a matched collection request number is written into the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1915</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When the weight of the freight corresponding to the collection request information is measured by means of the meter <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> reads obtained weight information from the meter <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. When there is a freight lot, weight values of all of the corresponding freight goods are measured and the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> adds the weight values to provide weight information (step <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> performs charge calculation on the basis of the obtained weight information (step <highlight><bold>1925</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the charge calculation process, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> computes a flat rate on the basis of a flat rate system DB precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and adds the flat rate to the cost. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the flat rate system DB is a database in which flat rates <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> are registered in respect of charge items <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight>. The flat rate is a fee of constant amount which is added to the cost regardless of the contents of the order. A flat rate is computed by adding individual flat rates <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> corresponding to individual charge items <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight> in the flat rate system DB <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, on the basis of an incidental service charge system DB precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> computes an incidental service fee and adds it to the cost. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the incidental service charge system DB is a database in which necessary incidental service fees are registered in respect of individual incidental service items <highlight><bold>2310</bold></highlight>. The incidental service is a service such as time appointed delivery or chilled transport carried out in accordance with a demand by the consignor in addition to the ordinary service and a fee added when the consignor utilizes such a service is an incidental service charge. Here, an incidental service fee <highlight><bold>2320</bold></highlight> corresponding to an incidental service item <highlight><bold>2310</bold></highlight> matching the incidental service <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is determined. When there are a plurality of matching incidental services, the fee is calculated by totaling fees (step <highlight><bold>2120</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> examines whether the information set in the reader/writer type <highlight><bold>1335</bold></highlight> in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is the bar code label printer. If the reader/writer type is of the bar code label printer, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>2128</bold></highlight> but in case of a different type, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>2130</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2124</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>2128</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> consults an address classified arrival store name DB precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by using the consignee address <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> contained in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> to determine an arrival store name. The address classified arrival store name DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is identical to the address classified arrival store name DB in the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> and the arrival store name is settled similarly to the step <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>2130</bold></highlight>, a transport distance is determined by consulting a transport distance calculation DB precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, in the transport distance calculation DB <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight>, departure stores <highlight><bold>2410</bold></highlight> are set in the row direction, arrival stores are set in the column direction and inter-base station distances <highlight><bold>2430</bold></highlight> are registered at intersection points of the departure stores and arrival stores. On the basis of departure store names precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in respect of the individual portable terminal systems <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and an arrival store name obtained by the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>1915</bold></highlight> (when the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the IC card reader/writer or electronic tag reader/writer) or in the step <highlight><bold>2128</bold></highlight> (when the reader/writer type of the consignor destination freight information system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the bar code label printer), the departure stores <highlight><bold>2410</bold></highlight> and arrival stores <highlight><bold>2420</bold></highlight> in the transport distance calculation DB <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> are retrieved to determine the transport distance from a transport distance described at a matching site. For example, if the departure store is Totsuku store and the arrival store is Kohhoku Higashi store, the transport distance is 15 km. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> consults a weight dependent charge system DB precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to compute a weight dependent fee and add it to the cost. The weight dependent fee is a fee determined in accordance with the transport distance and the weight of freight and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, weight dependent fees corresponding to weight zones <highlight><bold>2510</bold></highlight> and distance zones <highlight><bold>2520</bold></highlight> are registered in the weight dependent charge system DB. On the basis of the weight value read by the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight> and the transport distance determined in the step <highlight><bold>2130</bold></highlight>, the transport fee is determined from a fee corresponding to the matching weight zone <highlight><bold>2510</bold></highlight> and distance zone <highlight><bold>2520</bold></highlight> in the transport charge system DB <highlight><bold>2500</bold></highlight>. For example, if the weight is 7 kg and the transport distance is 15 km in the figure, the weight zone is &ldquo;5 to 10 kg&rdquo; and the distance zone is &ldquo;10 to 30 km&rdquo; and the transport fee is 370 yen (step <highlight><bold>2140</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Further, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> determines a discount rate on the basis of a discount rule set in the special charge rule <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> obtained in the step <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight>. During the determination of the discount rate, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> consults, as necessary, the information such as the weight information obtained in the step <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight> and the utilization cost history <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight>. When the condition matches a plurality of discount rules, discount rates determined from the individual discount rules are multiplied together to compute a final discount rate. For example, if the utilization fee total for this month is 101000 yen and the weight is 110 kg in case of the special charge rule <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the final discount rate is 0.9&times;0.95&equals;0.855. The processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> computes a final fee by multiplying the cost calculated in the step <highlight><bold>2140</bold></highlight> by the final discount rate (step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> When the final fee is computed in the manner as above, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> displays the computed fee on the output unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and then proceeds to the next process in the step <highlight><bold>1930</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2160</bold></highlight>). In the step <highlight><bold>1930</bold></highlight>, it is examined whether the bill index <highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight> in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;cash income&rdquo;. If the bill index <highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight> is the cash income, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1935</bold></highlight> but in case of a different class, the step <highlight><bold>1935</bold></highlight> is skipped and the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1940</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When the bill index <highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight> is the cash income, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> subtracts the fee computed in the step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight> from the electronic money balance read in the step <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> to calculate an electronic money balance after the cash income. The electronic money balance is displayed on the output unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the electronic money balance <highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight> in the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> is updated with the displayed balance by means of the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. When the electronic money balance is minus, a short account is displayed on the output unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. When the cost can be recovered correctly, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> holds &ldquo;finished&rdquo; in the recovery index (step <highlight><bold>1935</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>1940</bold></highlight>, it is examined whether the bill index <highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight> in the collection request information is &ldquo;pay on arrival&rdquo;. In the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> if the bill index <highlight><bold>1324</bold></highlight> is pay on arrival but in case of a different class, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1945</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to deliver an account/receipt which describes the consignor name <highlight><bold>1328</bold></highlight> and bill index contained in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, the transportation service contractor name, departure store name and person in charge name precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the fee calculated in the step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight> and date of charge calculation, and the sign column. The processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also causes the IC card reader/writer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to record the utilization date and the fee calculated in the step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight> in the utilization date column <highlight><bold>2040</bold></highlight> and cost column <highlight><bold>2050</bold></highlight> in the utilization cost history <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight> of the IC card <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>1945</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the collection information register process, the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is first examined and it is decided whether the reader/writer type is the electronic tag reader/writer (step <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>). If the reader/writer type is the electronic tag reader/writer, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to register the weight obtained in the step <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight>, the fee calculated in the step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight>, the person in charge number precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the data of execution of register and &ldquo;collection&rdquo; indicated in the work index in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> attached to the freight of interest. When the recovery index held by the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>1935</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, &ldquo;finish&rdquo; is registered, as recovery class, in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> but when the recovery index is not held, &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo; is registered. In case of a freight lot, similar information is all registered in the corresponding lot electronic tags <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>.

Also, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> reads the freight number precedently registered in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> by means of the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and stores the information registered in the basic electronic tag <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2630</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> examines whether the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> in the held collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is not less than &ldquo;2&rdquo; and when the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> is less than <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the processor ends the process (step <highlight><bold>2640</bold></highlight>). If the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> is not less than 2, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> sets, as the lot number, an initial value 2 and holds it (step <highlight><bold>2650</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to register the held collection request information, the arrival store name, the weight information, the fee calculated in the step <highlight><bold>2150</bold></highlight>, the person in charge number, the register date and the work index, together with the freight number registered in the basic electronic tag in the step <highlight><bold>2630</bold></highlight> and the lot number, in the lot electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> carried by the collector in charge. Register of the recovery index in the lot electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is carried out similarly to the step <highlight><bold>2620</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> decides whether the value of lot number exceeds the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> in the collection request information. If the value of the lot number is less than the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>, the process in the step <highlight><bold>2660</bold></highlight> is repeated but if the value of lot number exceeds the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>, the collection information register process is ended (step <highlight><bold>2670</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Following the collection information register process, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to deliver special freight index labels by the number indicated by the number <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> in accordance with the special freight index <highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight> in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. The special freight index labels are attached to the freight goods by the person in charge. For example, when the special freight index <highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;fragile&rdquo;, a label describing &ldquo;Fragile, handle with care&rdquo; is delivered as the special freight index label (step <highlight><bold>1955</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> examines whether a collection register end request from the input unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is present (step <highlight><bold>1960</bold></highlight>). In the absence of the collection register end request, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> repeats the process following the step <highlight><bold>1915</bold></highlight> to carry out the process in connection with another order. In the presence of the collection register end request, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to deliver a receipt describing the collection request information, arrival store name, weight information, fee, person in charge number, register date and work index which are stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as well as the sign column.

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In the unloading process <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the on-vehicle system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> first receives a person in charge number and a base station name from the input unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and stores them in the storage unit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. For reception of the person in charge number, an IC card reader/writer, for example, is provided for the on-vehicle system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the person in charge number may be accepted through the medium of an IC card in which the person in charge number of each person in charge is registered. This holds true for register of the person in charge number in other processes (step <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Next, processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to obtain, from the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the freight number, lot number, electronic tag index, the number special freight index, departure store, arrival store and delivery appointed time which are registered in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and to hold them (step <highlight><bold>2815</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> retrieves a delivery destination/date change freight DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the in-base station freight information system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by using the freight number as the key and examines whether delivery destination/date change information is registered in connection with the freight of interest. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the delivery destination/date change freight DB holds changed delivery destination information <highlight><bold>3015</bold></highlight> and changed desirable delivery date information <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> in correspondence to freight numbers <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>. The changed delivery destination information <highlight><bold>3015</bold></highlight> includes name <highlight><bold>3030</bold></highlight>, address <highlight><bold>3035</bold></highlight>, telephone number <highlight><bold>3040</bold></highlight>, electronic address <highlight><bold>3045</bold></highlight> of the changed destination and changed arrival store name <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Through the delivery destination/date change requesting and handling process to be described later, either or both of the changed delivery destination information <highlight><bold>3015</bold></highlight> and the changed desirable delivery time information <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> are registered in the delivery destination/date change freight DB <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2817</bold></highlight>). When a record having a freight number <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> coincident with the freight number is found as a result of retrieval, the program proceeds to the process of step <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight>. But in the absence of a record having a freight number <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> coincident with the freight number, the process of step <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> is skipped and the program proceeds to the process of step <highlight><bold>2825</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2817</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight>, information of the record containing that freight number <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> is read.

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>2825</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> registers the person in charge number stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> and the present time in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. Then, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> transmits that information and freight pass information containing the freight number, lot number and &ldquo;unloading&rdquo; indicated in the work index to the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2825</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> retrieves a transport route pattern DB by using the departure store name and arrival store name as the key to determine transport route base stations. In the transport route pattern DB, transport route base stations are registered at intersection points of a matrix of departure store <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> and arrival store <highlight><bold>3120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. For example, if the departure store is &ldquo;Sapporo nishiten&rdquo; and the arrival store is &ldquo;Fukuoka higashiten&rdquo;, then an entry <highlight><bold>3130</bold></highlight> will determine that the transport route is Sapporo nishiten-Chitose Kuhkohten-Fukuoka kuhkohten-Fukuoka higashiten. In the event that a base station to which the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> belongs is not included in the thus determined transport route base stations, an erroneous alarm to this effect is delivered to the output unit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2830</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> When a delivery time is designated by the appointed delivery time <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> obtained in the step <highlight><bold>2815</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> delivers the appointed delivery time, freight number and arrival store name to the output unit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2835</bold></highlight>). In case a special freight class such as &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; or &ldquo;precision machinery and instruments&rdquo; is indicated by the special freight index <highlight><bold>1322</bold></highlight>, the contents and the freight number are delivered to the output unit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. By watching the output, the person in charge of work can identify and handle the special freight with ease (step <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Further, when the number is not less than 2, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> registers the holding freight number, lot number and the number in the lot freight information DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight>, lot number <highlight><bold>3220</bold></highlight> and the number <highlight><bold>3230</bold></highlight> are registered in the lot freight information DB. If, in this process, a record exists in which both the freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> and the lot number <highlight><bold>3230</bold></highlight> have the same values as the freight number and lot number to be registered, register operation into the lot freight information DB <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> is not carried out (step <highlight><bold>2845</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The processor checks whether a lot check start request is inputted to the input unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In the absence of the lot check start request, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> clears the holding information and returns to the process in the step <highlight><bold>2815</bold></highlight> and repeats the aforementioned process in connection with the next freight (step <highlight><bold>2850</bold></highlight>). When the lot check start request is detected in the step <highlight><bold>2850</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> examines the lot freight information DB <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> and counts the number of records in which the same freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> is registered. The thus obtained count value is compared with a value registered in the number <highlight><bold>3230</bold></highlight> corresponding to the freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> of interest and the result is delivered, together with the freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight>, the number <highlight><bold>3230</bold></highlight> and the count value, to the output unit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Then, a lot freight information erase request is received from the input unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in respect of the individual freight numbers and when a request from the operator occurs, a record having the same freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> as the freight number in question is erased from the lot freight information DB <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2860</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> When the lot check in the step <highlight><bold>2860</bold></highlight> ends, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> examines whether a work end request is inputted to the input unit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In the presence of the work end request, the processor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> ends the process and in the absence of the work end request, the processor repetitively carries out the processes following the step <highlight><bold>2815</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2870</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> receives the freight pass information from the on-vehicle system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>2825</bold></highlight>, it registers that freight pass information in a freight pass DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the freight pass information DB consists of freight number <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight>, lot number <highlight><bold>3320</bold></highlight>, base station name <highlight><bold>3330</bold></highlight>, work index <highlight><bold>3340</bold></highlight>, pass time <highlight><bold>3350</bold></highlight>, vehicle number <highlight><bold>3370</bold></highlight>, custody index <highlight><bold>3380</bold></highlight> and person in charge name <highlight><bold>3390</bold></highlight>. When, in this process, a record has already been present in which the same values as those of the freight number and lot number contained in the received pass freight information are set in both the freight number <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> and the lot number <highlight><bold>3220</bold></highlight>, register operation into the freight pass information DB <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> is not carried out (step <highlight><bold>2875</bold></highlight>). The in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> transmits data registered in the freight pass information DB <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> at intervals of constant time to the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> through the inter-base station network <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2885</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Firstly, in the automatic sorting system <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, a person number of a person in charge of sorting work is received from the input unit <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>3410</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> causes the electronic reader/writer <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> to read the freight number, lot number and arrival store name from an electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. In case the base station for execution of the sorting work is an arrival store, the consignee name <highlight><bold>1336</bold></highlight>, address <highlight><bold>1338</bold></highlight>, telephone number <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>, incidental service <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> and appointed delivery time <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> in the collection request information <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> held in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> are also read in addition to the aforementioned information (step <highlight><bold>3420</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Next, destination classified sorting designation is carried out (step <highlight><bold>3440</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows a detailed flow chart of the destination classified sorting designation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>3440</bold></highlight>, it is first decided on the basis of an arrival store name read out of the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> whether the base station in question is an arrival store in which freight goods are about to be sorted (step <highlight><bold>3510</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> If the base station of interest is not the arrival store, the processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> consults an arrival store classified sorting lot DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> by using the held arrival store name as the key to designates the freight number of the freight goods in question and sorting ports to the sorting line <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, in the arrival store classified sorting DB, base station names <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight> indicative of base stations serving as destinations of freight goods distributed from the sorting ports are registered in correspondence to sorting port numbers <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight> for identifying the sorting ports of the sorting line <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. Excepting the case where the matching arrival store is not present, one or more base station names are registered in the arrival store names <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight>. After issuing the sorting designation to the sorting line <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> shifts to the next process in step <highlight><bold>3450</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>3520</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the base station in question is an arrival store, the processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> uses the information read in the step <highlight><bold>3420</bold></highlight> to cause the label printer <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> to issue a seal-like label described with the information. This label is attached to the freight of interest by the person in charge (step <highlight><bold>3430</bold></highlight>). Next, the processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> examines from the held appointed delivery date <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> whether the delivery time is appointed. If the time for delivery is appointed, the program proceeds to the process in step <highlight><bold>3530</bold></highlight> but if the delivery time is not appointed, the process in step <highlight><bold>3530</bold></highlight> is skipped and the program proceeds to the process in step <highlight><bold>3540</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>3525</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>3530</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> commands sorting of freight goods kept in custody by consulting a sorting time zone&mdash;delivery end time correspondence DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>.

For example, it will be seen that freight goods sorted between 10:00 and 12:00 in the figure are scheduled to be delivered before 14:00. The processor <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> retrieves a time zone to which the current time belongs from the time zones <highlight><bold>3710</bold></highlight> to obtain a corresponding delivery end schedule time <highlight><bold>3720</bold></highlight>. Then, the appointed delivery time <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> obtained in the step <highlight><bold>3420</bold></highlight> is compared with the work end schedule time. If the delivery end schedule time is earlier, the sorting line <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> is commanded to sort the corresponding freight in question to the custody freight sorting port.

<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In the delivered freight hand-over <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, a delivery register index is first received from the input unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. When freight cannot be handed over for the reasons that the consignee is absent at the time of delivery of freight, &ldquo;absence register&rdquo; is inputted as the delivery register index but when hand-over is completed, &ldquo;delivery completion register&rdquo; is inputted (step <highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight>). With the delivery register index inputted, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to read, from the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the freight number, lot number, collection request information, weight, electronic tag index and fee. At that time, if the electronic tag classification is a lot tag, the read-out contents is discarded and information is read out of another electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4115</bold></highlight>). Next, the delivery register index inputted in the step <highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight> is decided and if the delivery completion register prevails, the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>4125</bold></highlight> but if the absence register prevails, the program proceeds to the process in step <highlight><bold>4160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>4125</bold></highlight>, the contents of bill index in the collection request information read out of the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> in the step <highlight><bold>4115</bold></highlight> is further decided.

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> displays a fee read out of the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, together with the freight number, on the output unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> receives the input of charge recovery index from the input unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. When the recovery index is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> updates the recovery index by using this indication. Next, with the recovery index inputted in the step <highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight> being &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to deliver a receipt describing the consignee name, bill index, fee, transport service contractor name, base station name, person in charge name, delivery date and sign column in the collection request information. It is assumed that the transport service contractor name, base station name and person in charge name are precedently registered in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4135</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>4140</bold></highlight>, the person in charge name, delivery date and &ldquo;delivery completion&rdquo; indicated in the work index are registered in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> by means of the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. At that time, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> registers similar information in a lot electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> having the same freight number as that read in the step <highlight><bold>4115</bold></highlight>. The freight number, lot number, collection request information, weight, fee and the delivery data registered in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> are stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> examines whether a delivery completion register end request is inputted from the input unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and in the absence of the delivery completion register end request, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> repeats the process following the step <highlight><bold>4115</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4145</bold></highlight>). In the presence of the inputted end request, the freight number, lot number, collection request information, weight and fee stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are described by the number of freight goods handed over to the consignee and a receipt described with the transport service contractor name, base station name, person in charge name, delivery date and sign column and its copy are delivered from the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>, together with the aforementioned information. The receipt is signed by the consignee and then carried back by the person in charge while the copy being transferred to the consignor (step <highlight><bold>4155</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

At that time, similarly to the step <highlight><bold>4140</bold></highlight>, similar information is also registered in the electronic tag <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> having the same freight number and information such as the processing date, freight number, lot number, collection request information, weight and fee is stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4160</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> examines whether an absence register end request is inputted from the input unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and in the absence of the absence register end request, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> returns to the step <highlight><bold>4115</bold></highlight> to repeat the absence register process in connection with other freight goods (step <highlight><bold>4170</bold></highlight>). In the presence of the absence register end request, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> causes the label printer <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> to deliver an absence slip in which the freight number stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and the article, the number and consignor name in the collection request information are described in correspondence to the number of freight goods and in which the consignee name, transport service contractor name, base station name, person in charge name, processing date, sign column and a sentence giving notice of the absence. The absence slip is left at the consignee destination in order to inform the consignee of the absence (step <highlight><bold>4175</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> After the receipt is delivered in the step <highlight><bold>4155</bold></highlight> or the absence slip is delivered in the step <highlight><bold>4175</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> transmits the delivery register information registered in the storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, such as the freight number, delivery (processing) date, work index and recovery index, to the delivery/custody freight management system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> through the radio communication unit <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4180</bold></highlight>). In the delivery/custody freight management system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> receives the delivery register information transmitted from the portable terminal system <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> by way of the radio communication unit <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> and transmits it to the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the in-base station network <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4185</bold></highlight>).

The processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> of the delivery/custody freight management system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> causes the electronic tag reader/writer <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> installed near an entrance of the custody place to read the freight number and the lot number from the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of the freight which passes through the entrance when it is brought into the custody place. At that time, the processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> writes the current date as entry date into the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. When the entry date has already been recorded on the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, register operation of the entry date is not effected. The processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> transmits, as the freight pass information, the freight number and lot number as well as the base station name precedently stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, the person in charge name inputted in the step <highlight><bold>4205</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;custody&rdquo; indicated in the work index to the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, thus ending the process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> decides the type of the custody freight handling request inputted in the step <highlight><bold>4310</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4340</bold></highlight>). If the custody freight handling request is a long-term custody freight notice command, the processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> extracts, from the custody freight location DB <highlight><bold>4400</bold></highlight>, a record of data for which a preset time starting with a date set in the entry date <highlight><bold>4440</bold></highlight> has elapsed. Then, the freight number <highlight><bold>4410</bold></highlight>, lot number <highlight><bold>4420</bold></highlight> and location <highlight><bold>4450</bold></highlight> in the extracted record are delivered, as long-term custody freight information, to the output unit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> and the process ends (step <highlight><bold>4350</bold></highlight>). On the other hand, when the custody freight handling request is a carry-out freight command, delivery time zone information including delivery start schedule date and delivery end schedule date is received from the input unit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> takes out of the custody freight location information DB <highlight><bold>4400</bold></highlight> a record in which the value set in the appointed delivery date lies between the delivery start schedule date and the delivery end schedule date in the delivery time zone information received here. Then, the processor deliver the freight number <highlight><bold>4410</bold></highlight>, lot number <highlight><bold>4420</bold></highlight> and location information <highlight><bold>4450</bold></highlight> in the taken-out record and transmits the freight number <highlight><bold>4410</bold></highlight> and lot number <highlight><bold>4420</bold></highlight>, as carry-out information, to the in-base statio freight information system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, thus ending the process (step <highlight><bold>4360</bold></highlight>). In the in-base station freight information system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the carry-out information forwarded from the delivery/custody freight management system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is stored in a carry-out freight DB stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, the carry-out DB has a list of freight number <highlight><bold>4510</bold></highlight> and lot number <highlight><bold>4520</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4370</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the process flow in the freight information management process <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> When receiving the pass freight information from the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4602</bold></highlight>), the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> registers data regarding transport history in a freight transport history DB. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>, the freight transport history DB holds pass point, base station name, work index at the base station, pass date, person in charge of work, and name of a vehicle participating in the work in respect of individual freight numbers (step <highlight><bold>4604</bold></highlight>). The processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> consults the freight transport history DB <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> and carries out the following process in respect of the individual freight numbers. Firstly, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> examines the latest work index registered in the freight transport history and if the work index is collection, the processor proceeds to step <highlight><bold>4608</bold></highlight> and in case of a different class, the processor proceeds to step <highlight><bold>4622</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4606</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In case the latest work index is collection, freight attribute information necessary for management of freight is registered in a freight attribute DB in this phase. Various kinds of information as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference> are held in respect of the individual freight numbers in the freight attribute DB (step <highlight><bold>4608</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, an arrival store/departure store area information DB is consulted to retrieve an arrival store name meeting information concerning a delivery destination in the freight attribute DB <highlight><bold>4700</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>, in the arrival store/departure store area information DB, district areas <highlight><bold>5020</bold></highlight> in which base stations taking charge of arrival stores or departure stores are registered in respect of the individual base stations (arrival stores/departure stores) <highlight><bold>5010</bold></highlight>. On the basis of an arrival store name obtained from this DB and a departure store name obtained from the freight attribute information <highlight><bold>4700</bold></highlight>, a transport route pattern DB <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> is retrieved to extract a transport route. The processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> registers the extracted transport route in a transport route schedule DB. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> holds base station index <highlight><bold>4910</bold></highlight>, arrival base station names <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> corresponding to the base station index and arrival schedule date <highlight><bold>4930</bold></highlight> at the arrival base station in respect of the individual freight numbers. Of the information in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight>, the arrival schedule date <highlight><bold>4930</bold></highlight> is determined and registered/updated through a process for calculation of arrival/delivery schedule date in step <highlight><bold>4612</bold></highlight> when the collection process or the loading process ends (step <highlight><bold>4610</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>4612</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> performs calculation of arrival schedule dates at the individual base stations and delivery destination. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> shows a flow chart of the process for calculation of the arrival/delivery schedule date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In the calculation process of arrival schedule date, a pass point in the latest history data (data at the end of the history data) is determined as base station u at present on the basis of the freight transport history DB <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5240</bold></highlight>). The processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> extracts a base station next to the present base station u from the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> and specifies a shift master DB of transport mail from the present base station u to the next base station v. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>, transport mail shift <highlight><bold>5310</bold></highlight> on route, base station departure time <highlight><bold>5320</bold></highlight> of each transport mail vehicle shift and arrival time <highlight><bold>5330</bold></highlight> at the next base station are registered in the transport mail shift master DB <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight>. Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> extracts a transport mail shift which can depart in the nearest future in accordance with the specified transport mail shift master DB <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> and the pass date in the latest history data and on the basis of the arrival time of the transport mail shift, determines an arrival schedule time at the next base station v (step <highlight><bold>5242</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, it is decided whether the next base station v is delivery destination and if the next base station v is a delivery destination, the calculation process of arrival schedule date ends (step <highlight><bold>5244</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> If the next base station V is not a delivery destination, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> uses the previously determined arrival schedule date to extract, from a work shift master DB of the base station v, a work shift in which a series of work consisting of unloading, sorting and loading can be started earliest. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference>, work shift <highlight><bold>5410</bold></highlight> and start time <highlight><bold>5420</bold></highlight> and end time <highlight><bold>5430</bold></highlight> of each work shift are registered in respect of the individual base stations in the work shift master DB <highlight><bold>5400</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> consults the transport mail shift master DB <highlight><bold>5300</bold></highlight> of transport mail from the base station v to the next base station w on the basis of an extracted work shift end time <highlight><bold>5430</bold></highlight> and calculates an arrival time at the base station w similarly to the step <highlight><bold>5242</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5246</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> examines whether the base station w is a delivery destination and if a delivery destination, this process ends (step <highlight><bold>5248</bold></highlight>). In case the base station w is not a delivery destination, the base station v is replaced with the base station w (step <highlight><bold>5250</bold></highlight>) and the processor returns to the step <highlight><bold>5246</bold></highlight> to calculate an arrival schedule time at a base station after next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> After ending the calculation of the arrival schedule date, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> compares the calculated arrival schedule date with the arrival schedule date registered in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4614</bold></highlight>). In case the two coincide with each other, indicating that the freight is transported on schedule, the process ends as it is. If the two differ from each other, the schedule of transport is not on schedule. In this case, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> updates an arrival schedule date <highlight><bold>4930</bold></highlight> at the base station (or consignee destination) for which the calculated arrival schedule date differs from the arrival schedule date registered in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight>, with the calculated arrival schedule date. Since the arrival schedule date is registered initially at the time that the collection information is settled, arrival schedule dates calculated for the individual base stations are all registered (step <highlight><bold>4616</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> When the arrival (delivery) schedule date at the consignee destination is changed, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> informs a consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of a new arrival (delivery) schedule date. The consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of interest is specified from an electronic address corresponding to a delivery destination in the freight attribute DB <highlight><bold>4700</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>4618</bold></highlight>). If a base station for which the arrival schedule date is changed is present, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> informs, to an in-base station freight information management systems <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the base stations, arrival schedule freight information including freight number of the corresponding freight and the new arrival schedule date (step <highlight><bold>4620</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>4622</bold></highlight>, the latest work index is examined and if loading is indicated, the program proceeds to the step <highlight><bold>4614</bold></highlight> and as in the case of the work index indicative of collection, the process following the step <highlight><bold>4614</bold></highlight> is carried out. If the work index is not indicative of loading, it is further decided whether the latest work index is indicative of delivery completion (step <highlight><bold>4624</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> When the work index is delivery completion, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> informs the consignor destination freight information management system of delivery completion information including image information of a receipt with reception sign, delivery destination, delivery date, article and fee, thus ending the process (step <highlight><bold>4626</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> When the work index is determined not to be delivery completion in the step <highlight><bold>4624</bold></highlight>, it is further examined whether the latest work index is absent and if the work index is not absent, the process ends (step <highlight><bold>4628</bold></highlight>) On the other hand, in the absence of the work index, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits information such as consignor information, article and absence confirming date, the desirable delivery destination and inquiry about date to the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, thus ending the process (step <highlight><bold>4630</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Here, the calculation and recalculation of arrival/delivery schedule date is carried out at the time that the collection process or the loading process ends but for realization of precise transport pursuit, the recalculation of arrival/delivery schedule date may also be carried out at the time that the unloading or the sorting process ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> &lt;9: Delivery Destination/date Change Request and Handling&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the process flow of the delivery destination/date change request process <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and the delivery destination/date change handling process <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In this process, when the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> makes a request for changing the delivery destination and date in response to a delivery schedule freight information notice or an absence notice from the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> calculates an arrival schedule date in response to the change request and if being able to respond to the change, it informs the in-base station freight information management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of change information. If being unable to respond to the change, the system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> informs the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of change impermissible information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> When the change of delivery schedule freight information notice received from the consignee through the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> or the change of delivery destination or date responsive to the absence notice is commanded, the consignee destination freight information management system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> transmits a delivery destination change request or a delivery date change request to the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> in a unit of freight number (step <highlight><bold>5610</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> When the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> receives the delivery destination change request or delivery data change request forwarded from the consignee destination freight information management system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5812</bold></highlight>), the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> extracts a base station r in which information in an electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> can be updated earliest in order to write the change contents into the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of freight in question. Specifically, pass point names and work index are taken out of the latest history data in the freight transport history DB <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight>. In case the work index is loading completion, indicating that the process is on the way of transport, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> determines the next arrival base station as base station r. For determination of this base station, the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> is consulted to retrieve a pass point name extracted from the freight transport history DB <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> and an arrival base station next to the pass point is determined as this base station. On the other hand, if the work index is of unloading completion or sorting completion, indicating that the freight is present at any base station, this base station corresponds to a pass point extracted from the freight transport history DB <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5614</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> examines the contents of the change request and if the change request is for only the delivery date, proceeds to the process in step <highlight><bold>5636</bold></highlight> but if the change request is for both the delivery destination and the delivery date, it proceeds to the process in step <highlight><bold>5618</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5616</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> When only the request for changing the delivery destination prevails or both the request for changing the delivery destination and the request for changing the delivery date prevail, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> retrieves the arrival store/departure store area information DB <highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight> on the basis of address information of the change request delivery destination to extract a base station P taking charge of an area of the changed delivery destination as a new arrival store. Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> retrieves the transport route pattern DB <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> on the basis of the base stations r and P to determine a transport route ranging from the base station r to the delivery destination subject to the change request. Specifically, the determination is carried out as below in accordance with the base index of the base station r. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> (1) In case of base station r being departure store </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In this case, the transport route ranging from the base station r to the change request delivery destination is determined similarly to the ordinary transport route. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> (2) In case of base station r being departure transit store or arrival transit store </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In this case, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> retrieves an entry in which the arrival store name <highlight><bold>3120</bold></highlight> indicates the base station P from the transport route pattern DB <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> to extract a transport route pattern including the base station r in the transport route. Then, by using a transport route from the base station r to the base P in the extracted transport route pattern, the transport route reaching the change request delivery destination is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> (3) In case of base station r being arrival store </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> This case corresponds to moving toward an arrival store or a state in which the freight is in an arrival store and delivery is not yet finished or the delivery of the freight is not permitted because of the absence of the consignee. In this case, the transport route reaching the change request delivery destination is determined similarly to the ordinary transport route by using the arrival store (base station a) before the change request as a departure store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> temporarily stores the new transport route determined as above (step <highlight><bold>5618</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In connection with the determined new transport route, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> calculates schedule dates of freight arrival at individual base stations and the consignee destination after the change through the process similar to that explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>5620</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> gives the consignee destination freight information management system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> notice for asking whether delivery on the delivery date designated by the delivery data change request is permissible or impermissible. Here, it is examined whether the delivery date designated by the delivery date change request is later than the freight arrival schedule date at the consignee destination determined in the step <highlight><bold>5620</bold></highlight>. When the requested delivery date is earlier than the arrival schedule date, the delivery date change request cannot be dealt with and therefore, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> ends the process. At that time, inability to deal with and information for requesting the change of the delivery date are transmitted to the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In the absence of the delivery date change request, the program proceeds to the next process in step <highlight><bold>5625</bold></highlight> without alteration (step <highlight><bold>5622</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In the step <highlight><bold>5625</bold></highlight>, answer information including the delivery destination after the change and the new delivery schedule date (in the absence of the delivery date change request, the delivery schedule date calculated in the step <highlight><bold>5620</bold></highlight> and in the presence of the delivery date change request, the requested delivery date) is transmitted to the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> compares the new transport route determined in the step <highlight><bold>5618</bold></highlight> with the transport route before the change registered in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> to identify a base station common to the two, a base station newly added to the transport route and abase station removed from the transport route. At that time, the base station r is commanded to write the delivery destination information (name, address, electronic mail and the like) after the change and the requested delivery date (in the presence of a request) into the electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of the freight in question (step <highlight><bold>5626</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> informs the in-base station freight information-management system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the base station newly added to the transport route of the freight number and the arrival schedule date (step <highlight><bold>5630</bold></highlight>). Further, the freight number of the freight in question, together with pass cancel information indicating that the freight does not pass because of the change of the transport route, is transmitted to the base station excluded from the transport route (step <highlight><bold>5632</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> After the above process, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> erases information in transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> concerning the base station excluded from the transport route and registers base stations following the base station E which are determined to be included in the new transport route and newly calculated freight arrival schedule dates at these base stations in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight>. The processor also updates the changed information in the freight attribute information DB <highlight><bold>4700</bold></highlight>, thus ending the process (step <highlight><bold>5634</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the presence of only the delivery date change request is determined in the step <highlight><bold>5616</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> decides whether the requested delivery date can be dealt with. In this case, since the arrival schedule date at the consignee destination registered in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> coincides with an arrival schedule date on the shortest schedule, it is examined whether a delivery date designated by the delivery date change request is later than the arrival schedule date at the consignee destination registered in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight>. When the requested delivery date is earlier than the arrival schedule date, the delivery date change request cannot be dealt with and therefore the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> ends the process. At that time, inability to deal with and information for requesting the change of the delivery date are transmitted to the consignee destination freight information system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5636</bold></highlight>). In case the delivery date change request can be dealt with, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> transmits answer information including the freight number of the freight in question and the delivery schedule date in the form of the date designated by the delivery date change request to the consignee destination freight information management system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5640</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Next, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> informs the base station r of the change of the delivery schedule date and commands it to write the changed delivery date into an electronic tag <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of the freight in question (step <highlight><bold>5642</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> updates the arrival schedule date at the consignee destination in the transport route schedule DB <highlight><bold>4900</bold></highlight> and the desirable delivery date in the freight attribute information DB <highlight><bold>4700</bold></highlight> with the requested delivery date, thus ending the process (step <highlight><bold>5644</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In the consignee destination information management system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, when the answer information sent from the freight information overall management system <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is received, the answer to the change request is confirmed by the consignee (step <highlight><bold>5624</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Here, the freight of interest is searched by using the freight number as the key but the search can be carried out similarly even when other information than the freight number, for example, the article, consignee name or the like is used as the key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiments set forth so far, information described on the electronic tag is utilized effectively in the freight transportation to realize a managed freight management system which can efficiently deal with the change request of delivery destination/date and handling of freight goods including handling of special freight goods such as fragile or precision machinery and instruments. Also, a managed freight management system can be realized in which irregular conditions such as erroneous arrival, erroneous loading, leave-out, nonarrival of freight and over loading can be dealt with quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments but can take various forms within the gist of the present invention.
