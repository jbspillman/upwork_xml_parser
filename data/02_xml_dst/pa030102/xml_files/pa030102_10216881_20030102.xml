<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of reclosable packaging. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods of making reclosable packages having slide zippers on horizontal form-fill-seal (HFFS) machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Methods of making reclosable packages on various types of HFFS machines are well-known in the reclosable packaging art, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,876,842. Slide zippers, i.e., plastic zippers opened and closed by a slider, are likewise well-known in the reclosable packaging art. Examples of several types of slide zippers can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,007,143, 5,008,971, 5,131,121 and 5,664,299. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The reclosable packaging art, however, is virtually, if not totally, silent as it relates to the manufacture of slide-zippered packages on HFFS machines. Because of the facility which is provided by slide zippers to consumers of reclosable packages and because of the large volume of reclosable packages made on HFFS machines today, it is highly desirable and advantageous to combine the two technologies so that slide-zippered reclosable packages can be made on HFFS machines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide methods of making slide-zippered reclosable packages on HFFS machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a chain of packages is formed, filled and sealed on an HFFS machine or the like. A pair of opposing film extensions are provided on each-package. As the chain of packages is indexed forwardly, a reclosable zipper is inserted between the film extensions of the leading package and sealed thereto. A slider is then inserted on to the reclosable zipper of the leading package and the completed leading package is cut from the chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment of the present invention, packages having reclosable zippers are output from an HFFS machine or the like, either individually or in a chain. A slider is then inserted on to the zipper of each package in turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a third embodiment of the present invention, packages are formed, filled and sealed on an HFFS machine or the like. During package formation, a reclosable zipper is sealed to each package and then a slider is inserted on to the zipper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, packages are formed, filled and sealed on a horizontal form-vertical fill-seal (HVFS) machine or the like. During package formation, a reclosable zipper is sealed to each package and a slider is inserted on to each zipper, either before or after zipper sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail, with frequent reference being made to the drawings identified below in which the same numerals represent the same elements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows how slide-zippered packages can be made on a typical thermoform HFFS machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Forming film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is indexed off a coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the same in a package forming direction. Downstream of the forming film coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a forming station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the forming film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thermoformed, using techniques well-known to those of ordinary skill in the reclosable packaging art, into a chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of advancing box-like bottom portions or trays <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of what will ultimately be completed packages. Product may then be loaded into the bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a loading station <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> if desired. After optional product loading, top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is indexed off a coil <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the same in the package forming direction, laid over the advancing bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and perimeterly sealed thereto at four locations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at a sealing station <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to form a sealed package <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The seal at the package opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> takes the form of a peel seal so that the consumer can easily gain access to the contents of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a perspective view of a sealed package <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> formed on the thermoform HFFS machine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> prior to zipper and slider insertion, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are each provided with film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which extend beyond the peel seal <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on one side of the package <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not sealed to each other and may readily be spread apart from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After the top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sealed to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the sealing station <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the package chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> enters a zipper and slider insertion and attaching station <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At this station <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> the film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the leading package are spread apart from each other and interlocked reclosable zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> supplied from a coil <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the same is fed between the film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a cross-sectional view of the package chain and zipper and slider insertion and attaching station <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The zipper is comprised of two interlocking closure elements <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending therefrom which are sealed to the film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such as by a pair of seal bars (not shown). After the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is thus sealed to the film extensions of the leading package, the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is stomped at each end of the package by a stomping apparatus (not shown) to provide end stops for the slider and to ensure that the ends of the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> do not come apart during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is then removed from a coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> thereof and inserted on to the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a slider insertion apparatus (not shown). The slider and zipper are designed such that the slider will open the zipper as the slider is moved along the zipper in an opening direction towards an opening end of the zipper and close the zipper as the slider is moved along the zipper in a closing direction towards a closing end of the zipper. It is preferable during slider insertion that the slider be inserted at the closing end of the zipper since the zipper is initially interlocked. The slider will thus be positioned for normal functioning. If the slider is inserted at a location other than at the closing end, it will be necessary to actuate the slider by moving it to the closing end, after which the slider will be in position for normal functioning. Such actuation may be done on the HFFS machine, or it may be done by the initial package user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> After slider insertion, the leading package is cross-cut from the remainder of the chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by any one of many commonly known cutting apparatuses (not shown) to remove a completed package <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having a slide zipper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In practice, the package chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be a single chain as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, or, alternatively, may be a multiple chain, such as the double chain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the case of a double chain, where two packages are joined side by side, the process of making the packages is virtually identical to that described above, except that the zippers and sliders are attached to the opposite sides <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the package chain simultaneously, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, thus requiring two zipper and slider insertion and attaching stations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Additionally, a second cut is needed in the machine direction along the central axis <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the chain to remove the side-by-side packages from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiment of the present invention is not limited to practice on thermoform HFFS machines, but may be practiced on any type of package making machine where the packages are formed with film extensions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the type discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> depict a second embodiment of the present invention. Zippered packages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, either in a chain <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or individually as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, are output from an HFFS machine (not shown), or any other type of bag making machine. In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the package chain <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is indexed into a slider insertion station <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. At the slider insertion station <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or at an earlier station, the ends of the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the leading package in the chain <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are stomped as discussed above. Then, a slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is removed from the slider coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and inserted on to the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Finally, a completed package <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> have a slide zipper is cross-cut from the chain by a cutting apparatus (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the packages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are individual and not chained together. The individual packages <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are transported one by one into the slider insertion station <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by a conveyor belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or the like, where the ends of the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the leading package are stomped (unless the stomping was done during package formation) and a slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is removed from the slider coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and inserted on to the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to provide a completed slide-zippered package <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a thermoform HFFS machine <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> configured to make slide-zippered packages. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the forming film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is indexed off a coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the same. Downstream of the forming film coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a forming station <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the forming film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is thermoformed into a chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of box-like bottom portions or trays <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of what will ultimately be completed packages. Product may then be loaded into the bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the loading station <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> if desired. Each bottom portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with a lip <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on one side thereof, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which is a cross-sectional view of the chain <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. After optional product loading, the reclosable zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is indexed off a coil <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the same and laid over the lips <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The lower zipper flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is then sealed to the lips <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by a sealing mechanism, such as a heater bar <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, at a sealing station <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The heater bar <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is positioned below the lips <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is a cross-sectional view of zipper attachment to the package lips. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an insulating and guide plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> positioned between the zipper flanges. The insulating and guide plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> provides a surface for the heater bar to react against and removes any danger of sealing through the zipper flanges, thereby eliminating the need for accurate heat control. The insulating and guide plate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> also serves to guide and position the zipper onto the package lips to ensure accurate sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is then removed from the slider coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and inserted on to the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the instant bottom portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at an insertion station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. After slider insertion, the ends of the zipper are stomped. Alternatively, the zipper ends could have been stomped together earlier, either on the machine or pre-stomped prior to winding on the supply coil, and the zipper indexed to the bottom portion. The top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is then indexed off the top film coil <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, laid over the formed bottoms <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the attached zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and sealed to the formed bottoms <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> around the perimeter of the package at a second sealing station <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the seal at the mouth of the package may take the form of a peel seal to provide easy access to the contents of the package. Optionally, the top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, if it is long enough, may be heat tacked to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to provide a tamper evident seal <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In the final step, the completed packages <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are cross-cut from the chain at a cutting station <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. If a double chain is used, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, then the side-by-side packages must also be cut from each other in the machine direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When making packages using multiple package chains, it is not necessary that the zippers and sliders be applied to opposite sides <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the package chain, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</cross-reference>. Rather, it is also possible to apply the zippers and sliders to the same sides of the packages. For example, a triple package chain is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. In this case the top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pre-perforated so that it can be split into three sections and laid over each of the bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This splitting is achieved by a separator assembly <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> having three L-shaped separator plates <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>As the top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is indexed off its roll <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the vertical portions of the separator plates <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>split the pre-perforated top film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into three portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and guide the three top film portions as they are laid over their corresponding bottom portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the horizontal portions of the separator plates interact with the sealing mechanism to ensure that there is no seal through, eliminating the need for accurate heat control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the present invention is not limited to thermoform HFFS machines, but may be practiced on any type of HFFS machine and on any type of bag making machine for that matter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows how slide-zippered packages can be made on a horizontal form-vertical fill-seal machine (HFVS) <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Package film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is paid off a roll <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the same. Downstream a pull roller <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is provided for driving the film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> through the machine. A folder plow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> positioned downstream of the film roll <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> folds the package film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> about a bottom crease <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to form opposing package walls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Interlocked reclosable zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is then paid off a roll <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the same and fed between the advancing package walls. Sliders <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are inserted on to the reclosable zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> prior to the folder plow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> at package width intervals at what will be the closing end of the zipper by a slider insertion mechanism at the slider insertion station <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The sliders <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are supplied from the slider coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At a first sealing station <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the zipper flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are sealed to the opposing package walls. Then at stomping stations <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the ends of the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for a given package are stomped. At a second sealing station <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the folded film and zipper are cross-sealed to form discrete packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Because the zippers are closed, it is necessary to open the zippers in order to fill the packages. This is achieved at a slider opening station <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, where the slider is held in position as the zipper and film are advanced when the pull rollers <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are activated. As the zipper moves through the slider, it is opened. Alternatively, the slider itself may be moved. Then, at a cutting station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> the individual packages <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are cut from one another. The separated packages <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are then taken to the filling station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> where they are filled. Filling may occur by means of a filling turret <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or the packages may be filled in-line, both of which techniques are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. After a package is filled, the slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is moved backed to the closing end of the zipper. Finally, a tamper evident <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> seal may optionally be provided above the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Completed slide-zippered packages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are then output from the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A first variation of the fourth embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the sliders are attached downstream of the folder plow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, rather than upstream of the folder plow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the sliders <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are attached to the zippers <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at their opening ends, rather than at their closing ends as above. Thus, in order to open the zippers for package filling the zippers must be forced open from the outside of the packages, rather than by using the sliders. This opening action is carried out at an opening station <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> by a suitable mechanism provided for the specific zipper construction. After filling at the filling station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the slider is moved to the closing end of the zipper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A second variation of the fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Under certain circumstances it may be desirable to eliminate the step of opening the zipper for filling. This can be done by sealing one zipper flange to one side of the folded film at the first sealing station <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> prior to filling, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, rather than sealing both flanges to the film as done previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, one flange <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the zipper is sealed to one wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the folded film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> a distance below the top <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> protrudes above the zipper to form a pair of opposing ears <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. To ensure that the zipper flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> do not seal to each other or the other side of the package at the first sealing station <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, a J-shaped insulator plate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is inserted between the zipper flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and between the unsealed zipper flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the other package wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In addition, one of the seal bars <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is kept hot and the other <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is deactivated. Then, at the second sealing station <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the packages are cross-sealed from the bottom of the film <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> up to but not including the zipper. When it comes time to fill the bag at the filling station <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the zipper is bent to one side, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In this manner, filing may proceed unobstructed, and there is no danger of contaminating the zipper. After filling, the unsealed zipper flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sealed to the other side of the package and the ears <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are sealed to each other by a pair of seal bars <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> with a perforation seal and a peel seal above the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. At the same time the ends of the zipper are cross-sealed together and end stops for the slider are created. The above indicated zipper cross-seals extend below the zipper flanges into the package side seals, but not above and beyond the zipper profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A third variation of the fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. In this variation, the zipper <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are attached to the bottom <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the package, rather than at the top <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As the film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is fed over the folder plow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a perforator <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> perforates the film <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> below the slider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form a pair of perforations <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (alternatively, a single perforation <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be provided). The zipper is then sealed to the bottom of the package by sealing the zipper flanges to the film beyond the perforation lines, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. A peel seal <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be provided between the zipper flanges in order to maintain in the integrity of the packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The packages are completed as discussed above, except that they are filled from the opposing end to which the zipper has been attached. Further, if a bottom gusset is required a V shaped film can be introduced between the package walls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and sealed into place. During use, the packages are inverted so that the zipper and slider are at the top and the perforated portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is tom away from the package to gain access to the slider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the foregoing manner the object of the present invention is achieved. Modifications to the above would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, but would not bring the invention so modified beyond the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
