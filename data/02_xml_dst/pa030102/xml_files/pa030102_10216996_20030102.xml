<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of parcel distribution and more particularly to a method for prescreening mail pieces or parcels distributed by a postal system. Current postal distribution systems include two major sorting stations. A first is located proximate to the parcel sender, The second is located proximate to the parcel receiver, At the first station, heretofore referred to as the incoming station, parcels are scanned and sorted for distribution to the second, heretofore district station. The district station is determined by electronically reading the destination address and associating it to the proximate district station. At the district station, the parcel is sorted again, by destination address, and associated with the appropriate mail carrier for manual delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most postal systems offer their customers the opportunity to forward mail to another address. For example, should a mail recipient relocate, either permanently or temporarily, his or her mail may be rerouted accordingly, so that continuous mail delivery service can be maintained. The forwarding of parcels, although primarily a manual endeavor, is not without its problems. For example, forwarded parcels still must be sorted and routed to the district station, and from their, resorted and rerouted again to the district station associated with the forwarding address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One procedure for forwarding mail at the district level is as follows. During normal operation, the letter carrier sorts parcels into bins associated with addresses along his or her route. Should a forwarding request exist for one of his or her addresses, the carrier will receive a forwarding label with the new address. A forwarding card or marker is placed in the bin associated with the address effected by the forwarding request. And parcels, normally slated for that bin, now receive a new hand written address from the mail carrier. Parcels with the forwarded address hand written thereon, are then returned into the postal system and rerouted accordingly. This process includes several disadvantages, including time delay in having a parcel sorted and routed all the way to the local level and relying upon the mail carrier to manually redirect the parcel. Where mail carriers are overworked or understaffed, such rerouting may not take high priority thereby adding to the already elongated route of travel of the forwarded parcel to its proper destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another procedure has the letter carrier identifying parcels to be forwarded; withdrawing the parcels from the mailstream; and forwarding the parcels to a central processing center for forwarding. With the help of extraction techniques, staff at the central processing center enter the invalid, old or former address into a computer. The computer is networked to a central database. The database contains information about all change of address and/or forwarding requests. The database is queried to display a list of new addresses and names of persons who placed forwarding orders. Staff search the list for a match to the name indicated on the parcel to be forwarded. When a match is made, a new label with the new address is either automatically or manually applied to the parcel to be forwarded. The new label covers up at least the bar code printed on the parcel when it first entered the mailstream, essentially replacing the bar code with one for the new address. Accordingly, the letter can be read and coded automatically with other parcels in the mail stream. This process has several disadvantages, including expenditure of labor and resources in locating and applying the new label as well as pulling parcels to be forwarded from the mail stream. As a result delays and unnecessary rerouting occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another procedure makes use of optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Herein, mail pieces to be forwarded are intercepted by the letter carrier, provided with stamps that may read &ldquo;Relocated, address unknown&rdquo; and sent to an automatic forwarding center. The mail forwarding center is equipped with optical scanning equipment which automatically read the sender and receiver&apos;s address on the parcel to be forwarded, A database, having forwarding information, is automatically queried and the appropriate address determined. In addition to forwarding addresses, other information may be obtained from the database, including: mailing remarks; advance orders, and other comments. Analysis of data in the database assists in the decision as to how to further treat the mail piece to be forwarded. In an additional automatic step, a label with the new address is applied on the mail piece to be forwarded. A bar code is printed thereon and the mail piece is re-integrated into the regular stream of letters for delivery. This procedure also suffers from the disadvantages discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,821 discloses a system for the forwarding of incorrectly addressed parcels. The parcels are scanned early in the sorting process and a distinction is made between machine readable and illegible addresses. Machine readable addresses are compared with a list of forwarding addresses in a national database. Where a match is found, a new zip code is applied to the parcel and it is rerouted accordingly. Illegible addresses are scanned and a digital image is made and saved into memory. The image is then manually processed for appropriate forwarding. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a system and method for speeding up the forwarding of parcels while offering customers additional services and options. An additional advantage includes the lowering of costs for transporting and sorting parcels. Still another advantage is providing mail services with an additional service from which to generate revenue. These and other advantages are made available by the present invention wherein parcels subject to a forwarding request or related service request are scanned and stored in a particular password (and consecutive number in the overall customer forwarding requesters scheme) protected memory address along with a record of the request. The parcels are held in a holding station rather than being farther sorted in the mailstream, The customer is notified that parcels have been scanned. The customer may then remotely access the memory address and view images of the parcels (via password and number), and based on that viewed, order that some or all viewed parcels in fact be forwarded or disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further feature includes the opening of the parcel, scanning of its contents and making images of the contents available to the customer for prior forwarding approval. Upon such approval, the parcels are either resealed or placed in new accommodations and appropriately forwarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further feature of the present invention includes obtaining other information about the parcel in advance of delivery, such as addressee data, type and condition of parcel, size, weight and the like. Likewise, the character of the parcel, such as express or registered mail, may be known in advance. Herein, the customer is provided with advance notice that additional steps in receiving the parcel in question are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further feature of the present invention includes alternative modes of communication, including electronic communication with mobile devices. Such communication may include e-mail, SMS and the like to personal computers, mobile telephones, personal digital assistants and the like. This feature adds a degree of mobility for customers who may be traveling and such. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by the present system and method, the customer is provided with advance notice of mail to be received and/or forwarded such that advance decisions on delivery can be made. Likewise, the mail system is provided with an additional service from which to generate revenue, as well as a more efficient and reduced load mail stream to process.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> generally and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in particular, parcels <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are first introduced into a mail stream by a sender (not shown) at an inbound sorting station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Herein, the address surface of the parcels, and recipient address in particular, are scanned and read with optical scanning or video imaging equipment having OCR and/or other appropriate decoding means. The decoded digital image is stored into a local or remote memory by appropriate processing means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The memory, processor and configuration thereof for remote access and multiple users is a design choice known to one skilled in the computer arts. Given the location flexibility of networked computers, the memory and processor may be located at the inbound station, holding station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, or other location accessible to mail sorting staff. Should a parcel address not be machine readable, alternative means are employed such as manually reading the parcel destination address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> After a parcel destination address is determined database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is queried for a matching address. Database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> contains a list of all destination addresses from which a forwarding request or other special instructions was received. Special instructions may include preview of parcel contents; parcel characteristics (mail deliver service such as registered, courier, etc.); parcel dimensions; parcel condition; addressee data; and the like. In addition, the customers prior approval of forwarding the parcel or information related thereto may be sought. Entries in the database may comprise any format provided the intent of the request and appropriate supporting data is present. For example, rerouting requests may comprise recipient name, old and new address and effective time frame. The rerouting requests may be password and consecutive number protected and remotely (i.e. customer) accessible. In addition, supporting equipment at the location of scanning are present to execute special instructions. For example, where the customer requests that the contents of the parcels be scanned and forwarded for review and what not, parcel opening and resealing equipment and the like. Where parcels cannot be resealed, contents are placed into new parcels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When a match is found, the parcel is routed <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to holding station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; the requests are retrieved and executed; the scanned image and any other relevant information (pursuant to the special instructions) are stored in the memory address associated with the customer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; and the customer is notified. Such notification may be in electronic form <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and occur over the world wide web <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or other appropriate means. The electronic form may comprise e-mail, SMS and the like and is effected by means known to one skilled in the communications art. The message may comprise the number of items to be forwarded as well as other mail piece specific information including weight, size, addresser, and content. Likewise, the actual image itself my be communicated to the customer. This is especially helpful when the addressee data is incomplete or otherwise suspect. If numerous mailpieces are present, the information associated therewith may be cataloged via sequential numbers and the like. Alternatively, rather than communicating the message to the customer, the customer may be provided with queued or unqueued access to the forwarding database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Such access may be password and number controlled, on an account basis, and the like. As depicted in the figures a customer&apos;s new address <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is different from customer old address <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. However, this may not need be the case when a customer desires to simply preview and have approval control over his or her post, Instructions, generally, are depicted by arrow <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Where no match is found, parcels are routed through the mail stream per normal operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the customer provides his or her feedback regarding the images of the parcels being held for him or her at holding station <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, The feedback may also be communicated electronically as discussed above. Where approval for forwarding the parcels is not provided, the parcels are discarded. Where approval is given, the parcels are routed <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, per instructions in database <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as previously provided by the customer. Herein, the parcels are routed to a district sorting center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, locally sorted into appropriate bins <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and eventually routed to the customer&apos;s new address <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the customer provided approval for the communicating of images of the contents of the parcels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the images are communicated back <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> electronically. This adds a degree of mobility to the customer, who is now only bound to an electronic message receiving device. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a flow chart of the above described procedure is set out. The parcel is introduced into the mail stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The address surface of the parcel is scanned <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The destination address is decoded <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A database is searched for matches to the decoded address <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A determination <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is made whether their is a match in the database to the parcel destination address. If no match is found <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, conventional reading methods are employed <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as manual inspection. If a match is found <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the parcel image is saved into the database customer memory address <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the customer instructions are retrieved from the database <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Herein, the flowchart continues in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. At some point prior to the entry of the parcel into the mail stream (step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), the customer makes a forwarding request and/or submits other special instruction <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The request is saved into a password and consecutive number protected database memory address <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the password and number are forwarded to the customer for future database access <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> determination is made whether the parcel address was effectively read <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If the address was not successfully read <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, an image of the parcel destination address is made, if not already made, and saved into the customer database memory address <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The image is then sent to the customer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. If the parcel destination address was successfully read <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, it is sent to the customer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the method continues to step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the customer decides whether to have the parcel forwarded (electronically or physically) or discarded. This may be conveyed by password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
