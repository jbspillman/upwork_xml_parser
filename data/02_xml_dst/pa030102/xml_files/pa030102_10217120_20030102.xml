<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of porous materials. In particular, this invention relates to porous dielectric materials useful in the manufacture of electronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As electronic devices become smaller, there is a continuing desire in the electronics industry to increase the circuit density in electronic components, such as integrated circuits, circuit boards, multichip modules, chip test devices, and the like, without degrading electrical performance. At the same time, it is desirable to increase the speed of signal propagation in these components. One method of accomplishing these goals is to reduce the dielectric constant of the interlayer, or intermetal, insulating material used in the components. A method for reducing the dielectric constant of such interlayer, or intermetal, insulating material is to incorporate within the insulating film very small, uniformly dispersed pores or voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Porous dielectric matrix materials are well-known in the art. One known process of making a porous dielectric involves co-polymerizing a thermally labile monomer with a dielectric monomer to form a block copolymer, followed by heating to, decompose the thermally labile monomer unit. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,990 (Hedrick et al.). In this approach, the amount of the thermally labile monomer unit is limited to amounts less than about 30% by volume. If more than about 30% by volume of the thermally labile monomer is used, the resulting dielectric material has cylindrical or lamellar domains, instead of pores or voids, which lead to interconnected or collapsed structures upon removal, e.g., heating to degrade the thermally labile monomer unit. See, for example, Carter et. al., <highlight><italic>Polyimide Nanofoams from Phase</italic></highlight>- <highlight><italic>Separated Block Copolymers, Electrochemical Society Proceedings, </italic></highlight>volume 97-8, pages 32-43 (1997). Thus, the block copolymer approach provides only a limited reduction in the dielectric constant of the matrix material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Dielectric materials for use in integrated circuit manufacture have been reported having up to 30% porosity with closed cells. However, such report failed to describe how to achieve such high porosity while maintaining closed cells, i.e. with no interconnectivity between the pores. Conventional methods of making porous dielectric materials fail to achieve closed cell porosity above 30%. As a result, conventional methods provide porous dielectric materials having 30% porosity with interconnected pores. This pore interconnectivity can lead to degraded electrical performance, such as crosstalk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for porous dielectric materials having 30% porosity or greater, wherein the pores are not interconnected, particularly for use in the manufacture of electronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, the size and nature of porosity is easy to probe in a solid bulk sample. Typical techniques to probe the pore structure and pore dimensions include nitrogen and mercury porosimetry, xenon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultrasound. Methods of analyzing particles in solutions and adsorption of gases are outlined in Hemnitz, <highlight><italic>Principles of Colloid and Surface Chemistry, </italic></highlight>Marcel Dekker, New York, p 489-544. However, all of these techniques are unsuitable when trying to elucidate the nature of a thin film on a silicon wafer. In this special case the volume of material is too small relative to the weight and mass of the silicon substrate so that these techniques do not effectively probe the pore structure present in the film. Thus new techniques have been applied to this problem such as PALS or SANS which require nuclear reactors to generate the positronium ions or neutron particles respectively and therefore are too expensive and complex for use in a commercial laboratory or manufacturing facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for an improved method for determining the interconnectivity of pores in a thin, porous dielectric film. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Porous dielectric materials having a wide variety of porosities can be prepared according to the present invention. Typically, the porous materials have a porosity of &gE;30% by volume, preferably &gE;35%, more preferably &gE;40%, and even more preferably &gE;45%. Porosities of 50% can also be achieved according to the present invention. Such porosity is a measure of the total volume of pores in the dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pore structure of the porous thin film dielectric materials of the present invention can be determined by a variety of methods. Preferably, an electrochemical test is used to measure an electrical property of the material, such as impedance, conductivity and the like. Particularly suitable is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (&ldquo;EIS&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Dielectric films typically have a very high impedance. When the film matrix contains open channels, a decrease in impedance is recorded as solvent and ions penetrate the film. When monitored by EIS, these phenomena can evaluate the porosity of the dielectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an EIS experiment, a variable frequency alternating current (&ldquo;AC&rdquo;) potential is applied to a system and the current is measured. The response follows Ohm&apos;s law, (E&equals;IZ) where the current (&ldquo;I&rdquo;) and the impedance (&ldquo;Z&rdquo;) are represented by complex numbers. The frequency-independent impedance is related to resistance (&ldquo;R&rdquo;) and the frequency-dependent impedance is related to capacitance (&ldquo;C&rdquo;). When the data are computer modeled, a modified Randles circuit adequately describes the sample&apos;s behavior. A suitable Randles circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where R<highlight><subscript>ct </subscript></highlight>is the resistance for the charge transfer and C<highlight><subscript>dl </subscript></highlight>is the double layer capacitance.

In the case of a doped silicon wafer, coated with a dielectric, and immersed in solution, the wafer is one plate, the film is the non-conducting media, and the solution is the second plate. The capacitance of this system is dependent on solvent penetration into the film. In the case of water, the large difference between the dielectric constant of water (78) and that of the non-conducting film (1.1-4.1) results in changes to Cc reflecting changes in the dielectric constant of the film.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pore interconnectivity of a porous dielectric film is measured by placing a glass ball joint <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such as a PYREX&trade; glass ball, along with a rubber o-ring against the thin, porous dielectric layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> deposited onto a conductive silicon wafer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The resistivity (&ldquo;R&rdquo;) of such a conductive silicon wafer is typically &lt;0.02 Ohm-cm. The ball joint is held in place by a fastening means, such as a clamp, and an aqueous reference standard solution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is charged into the ball joint. Suitable reference solutions include, but are not limited to a 10,000 ppm of copper (as copper nitrate) ICP standard solution in 5% nitric acid or 0.1 molar copper chloride in water. A platinum electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is placed into the reference solution and then a second reference electrode is also inserted into the solution. The back side of the wafer, i.e. the side opposite the film, is also contacted with an electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A measuring or monitoring system <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is used to record an electrical measurement, such as impedance, capacitance, leakage current and the like. When measuring impedance, a suitable measuring system is a Solartron 1260 Gain/Phase Analyzer, EG&amp;G Princeton Applied Research (PAR) 273 potentiostat/Galvanostat, and Zplot Impedance Software (available from Scribner Associates) used to measure impedance. Individual data files collected are fitted to a modified Randles circuit, (Zsim Impedance software from Scribner Associates), and their impedance parameters are plotted and compared as a function of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The reference standard solution is allowed to remain in contact with the film for 24 hours and the impedance is measured again. The values are compared to those for a film of the same composition that is non-porous. Differences in conductivity values of less than 1 S/m, as determined using the EIS method, indicate closed cell pore structures. Differences in conductivity values of greater than 1 S/m, as determined using the EIS method, indicate open cell pore structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> One of the advantages of the present invention is that the porous dielectric materials have closed cell pore structures. By &ldquo;closed cell&rdquo; pore structures, it is meant that the pores within the porous dielectric material are substantially non-interconnected, and preferably are not interconnected. By &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; non-interconnected it is meant that less than 10% , preferably less than 5%, and more preferably less than 2% of the pores are interconnected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The high levels of porosity and the closed cell pore structures of the present porous dielectric materials are achieved by selecting porogens that are substantially compatible with the dielectric material and that have a mean particle size such that a closed cell pore structure is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; it is meant that a composition of B-staged dielectric material and porogen are optically transparent to visible light. It is preferred that a solution of B-staged dielectric material and porogen, a film or layer including a composition of B-staged dielectric material and porogen, a composition including a dielectric matrix material having porogen dispersed therein, and the resulting porous dielectric material after removal of the porogen are all optically transparent to visible light. By &ldquo;substantially compatible&rdquo; it is meant that a composition of B-staged dielectric material and porogen is slightly cloudy or slightly opaque. Preferably, &ldquo;substantially compatible&rdquo; means at least one of a solution of B-staged dielectric material and porogen, a film or layer including a composition of B-staged dielectric material and porogen, a composition including a dielectric matrix material having porogen dispersed therein, and the resulting porous dielectric material after removal of the porogen is slightly cloudy or slightly opaque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To be compatible, the porogen must be soluble or miscible in the B-staged dielectric material, in the solvent used to dissolve the B-staged dielectric material or both. When a film or layer of a composition including the B-staged dielectric material, porogen and solvent is cast, such as by spin casting, much of the solvent evaporates. After such film casting, the porogen must be soluble in the B-staged dielectric material so that it remains substantially uniformly dispersed. If the porogen is not compatible, phase separation of the porogen from the B-staged dielectric material occurs and large domains or aggregates form, resulting in an increase in the size and non-uniformity of pores. Such compatible porogens provide cured dielectric materials having substantially uniformly dispersed pores having substantially the same sizes as the porogen particles. Thus, the mean diameter of the resulting pores is substantially the same as the mean particle size of the porogen used to form the pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The compatibility of the porogens and dielectric matrix material is typically determined by a matching of their solubility parameters, such as the Van Krevelen parameters of delta h and delta v. See, for example, Van Krevelen et al:, <highlight><italic>Properties of Polymers. Their Estimation and Correlation with Chemical Structure, </italic></highlight>Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., 1976; Olabisi et al., <highlight><italic>Polymer</italic></highlight>- <highlight><italic>Polymer Miscibility, </italic></highlight>Academic Press, NY, 1979; Coleman et al., <highlight><italic>Specific Interactions and the Miscibility of Polymer Blends, </italic></highlight>Technomic, 1991; and A. F. M. Barton, <highlight><italic>CRC Handbook of Solubility Parameters and Other Cohesion Parameters, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd</superscript></highlight>Ed., CRC Press, 1991. Delta h is a hydrogen bonding parameter of the material and delta v is a measurement of both dispersive and polar interaction of the material. Such solubility parameters may either be calculated, such as by the group contribution method, or determined by measuring the cloud point of the material in a mixed solvent system consisting of a soluble solvent and an insoluble solvent. The solubility parameter at the cloud point is defined as the weighted percentage of the solvents. Typically, a number of cloud points are measured for the material and the central area defined by such cloud points is defined as the area of solubility parameters of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> When the solubility parameters of the porogen and dielectric matrix material are substantially similar, the porogen will be compatible with the dielectric matrix material and phase separation and/or aggregation of the porogen is less likely to occur. It is preferred that the solubility parameters, particularly delta h and delta v, of the porogen and dielectric matrix material are substantially matched. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the properties of the porogen that affect the porogen&apos;s solubility also affect the compatibility of that porogen with the B-staged dielectric material. It will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art that a porogen may be compatible with one B-staged dielectric material, but not another. This is due to the difference in the solubility parameters of the different B-staged dielectric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The compatible, i.e., optically transparent, compositions of the present invention do not suffer from agglomeration or long range ordering of porogen materials, i.e. the porogen is substantially uniformly dispersed throughout the B-staged dielectric material. Thus, the porous dielectric materials resulting from removal of the porogen have substantially uniformly dispersed pores. Such substantially uniformly dispersed, very small pores are very effective in reducing the dielectric constant of the dielectric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The porogens used to form the present highly porous dielectric materials have a particle size selected to maintain a closed cell structure at a given porosity. Too small a pore size may result in an open cell, or interconnected, pore structure for a give porosity of the dielectric material. A porogen having a particular particle size that provides a closed cell structure at 30% porosity may provide an open cell pore structure at higher levels of porosity. For example, for porous dielectric materials having &gE;30% porosity, the porogens must have a particle size greater than 2.5 nm. For 30% porosity, it is preferred that the porogen has a particle size &gE;2.75 nm, and preferably &gE;3 nm. Typically, for dielectric materials having a porosity of 30% to 35%, a porogen having a particle size in the range of 2.75 to 4 nm is selected, and preferably 3 to 3.5 rim. For dielectric materials having a porosity of 35% to 40%, a porogen having a particle size in the range of 3.5 to 8 nm, and preferably 4 to 7 nm, is selected. For dielectric materials having a porosity of 40% to 45%, a porogen having a particle size in &gE;5 nm is selected, preferably 5 to 15 nm, more preferably 5 to 11 nm, and even more preferably 5 to 7 nm. If the size of the porogen is too large, the resulting pores in the dielectric material will be too large to be suitable for advanced electronic devices having very narrow linewidths. Thus, there is an optimum range of pore sizes useful for providing porous dielectric materials having closed cell pore structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of porogens are suitable for use in the present invention. The porogen polymers are typically cross-linked particles and have a molecular weight and particle size suitable for use as a modifier in advanced interconnect structures in electronic devices. Typically, the useful particle size range for such applications is up to about 100 nm, such as that having a mean particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 100 nm. However, for the present closed cell porous dielectric materials, it is preferred that the mean particle size is in the range of about 2.75 to about 20 nm, more preferably from about 3 to about 15 nm, and most preferably from about 3 nm to about 10 nm. An advantage of the present process is that the size of the pores formed in the dielectric matrix are substantially the same size, i.e., dimension, as the size of the removed porogen particles used. Thus, the porous dielectric material made by the process of the present invention has substantially uniformly dispersed pores with substantially uniform pore sizes having a mean pore size in the range of from 2.75 to 20 nm, preferably 3 to 15nm, and more preferably 3 and 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The polymers suitable for use as porogens in the present invention are derived from ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated monomers and are removable, such as by the unzipping of the polymer chains to the original monomer units which are volatile and diffuse readily through the host matrix material.

Purification of the porogen particles may be accomplished either by precipitation of the porogen particles or adsorption of the impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To be useful as porogens in forming porous dielectric materials, the porogens of the present invention must be at least partially removable under conditions which do not adversely affect the dielectric matrix material, preferably substantially removable, and more preferably completely removable. By &ldquo;removable&rdquo; is meant that the polymer depolymerizes or otherwise breaks down into volatile components or fragments which are then removed from, or migrate out of, the dielectric material yielding pores or voids. Any procedures or conditions which at least partially remove the porogen without adversely affecting the dielectric matrix material may be used. It is preferred that the porogen is substantially removed. Typical methods of removal include, but are not limited to, chemical, exposure to heat or exposure to radiation, such as, but not limited to, UV, x-ray, gamma ray, alpha particles, neutron beam or electron beam. It is preferred that the matrix material is exposed to heat or UV light to remove the porogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The porogens of the present invention can be thermally removed under vacuum, nitrogen, argon, mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen, such as forming gas, or other inert or reducing atmosphere. The porogens of the present invention may be removed at any temperature that is higher than the thermal curing temperature and lower than the thermal decomposition temperature of the organo polysilica dielectric matrix material. Typically, the porogens of the present invention may be removed at temperatures in the range of 150&deg; to 500&deg; C. and preferably in the range-of 250&deg; to 425&deg; C. Typically, the porogens of the present invention are removed upon heating for a period of time in the range of 1 to 120 minutes. An advantage of the porogens of the present invention is that 0 to 20% by weight of the porogen remains after removal from the organo polysilica dielectric matrix material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, when a porogen of the present invention is removed by exposure to radiation, the porogen polymer is typically exposed under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, to a radiation source, such as, but not limited to, visible or ultraviolet light. The porogen fragments generated from such exposure are removed from the matrix material under a flow of inert gas. The energy flux of the radiation must be sufficiently high to generate a sufficient number of free radicals such that porogen particle is at least partially removed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a combination of heat and radiation may be used to remove the porogens of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In preparing the dielectric matrix materials of the present invention, a plurality of porogen particles described above are first dispersed within, or dissolved in, a B-staged dielectric material. Any amount of porogen may be combined with the B-staged dielectric materials according to the present invention. The amount of porogen used will depend on the particular porogen employed, the particular B-staged dielectric material employed, the extent of dielectric constant reduction desired in the resulting porous dielectric material, i.e. the particular porosity desired, and the mean pore size of the porogen particles. Typically, the amount of porogen used is in the range of from 30 to 50 wt %, based on the weight of the B-staged dielectric material, preferably from 30 to 45 wt %, and more preferably from 30 to 40 wt %. A particularly useful amount of porogen is in the range of form about 30 to about 35 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The porogens of the present invention may be combined with the B-staged dielectric material by any methods known in the art. Typically, the B-staged dielectric material is first dissolved in a suitable high boiling solvent, such as, but not limited to, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, 2-heptanone, &ggr;-butyrolactone, &egr;-caprolactone, ethyl lactate propyleneglycol monomethyl ether acetate, propyleneglycol monomethyl ether, diphenyl ether, anisole, n-amyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, cyclohexanone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N&prime;-dimethylpropyleneurea, mesitylene, xylenes, or mixtures thereof, to form a solution. The porogen particles are then dispersed or dissolved within the solution. The resulting dispersion is then deposited on a substrate by methods known in the art, such as spin coating, spray coating or doctor blading, to form a film or layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After being deposited on a substrate, the B-staged dielectric material is then substantially cured to form a rigid, cross-linked dielectric matrix material without substantially removing the porogen particles. The curing of the dielectric material may be by any means known in the art including, but not limited to, heating to induce condensation or e-beam irradiation to facilitate free radical coupling of the oligomer or monomer units. Typically, the B-staged material is cured by heating at an elevated temperature, e.g. either directly, e.g. heated at a constant temperature such as on a hot plate, or in a step-wise manner. Typically, the dielectric material containing polymeric porogens is first annealed at a temperature of from about 200&deg; to about 350&deg; C., and then heated to a higher temperature, such as from about 400&deg; to about 450&deg; C. to at least partially remove the porogens. Such curing conditions are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Once the B-staged dielectric material is cured, the film is subjected to conditions which remove the porogen without substantially degrading the organo polysilica dielectric matrix material, that is, less than 5% by weight of the dielectric matrix material is lost. Typically, such conditions include exposing the film to heat and/or radiation. It is preferred that the matrix material is exposed to heat or light to remove the porogen. To remove the porogen thermally, the dielectric matrix material can be heated by oven heating or microwave heating. Under typical thermal removal conditions, the polymerized dielectric matrix material is heated to about 350&deg; to 400&deg; C. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the particular removal temperature of a thermally labile porogen will vary according to composition of the porogen. Upon removal, the porogen polymer depolymerizes or otherwise breaks down into volatile components or fragments which are then removed from, or migrate out of, the dielectric matrix material yielding pores or voids, which fill up with the carrier gas used in the process. Thus, a porous dielectric material having voids is obtained, where the size of the voids is substantially the same as the particle size of the porogen. By &ldquo;substantially the same&rdquo; it is meant that the diameter of the pores is within 10% of the mean particle size of the porogens used. The resulting dielectric material having voids thus has a lower dielectric constant than such material without such voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method of manufacturing a porous dielectric material suitable for use in electronic device manufacture including the steps of: a) dispersing a plurality of removable polymeric porogen particles in a B-staged dielectric material, b) curing the B-staged dielectric material to form a dielectric matrix material without substantially degrading the porogen particles; c) subjecting the dielectric matrix material to conditions which at least partially remove the porogen to form a porous dielectric material without substantially degrading the dielectric material; wherein the porogen is substantially compatible with the B-staged dielectric material; wherein the dielectric material is &gE;30% porous; and wherein the mean particle size of the plurality of porogen particles is selected to provide a closed cell pore structure.

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that low dielectric constant materials are obtained having uniformly dispersed voids, a higher volume of voids than known dielectric materials and/or smaller void sizes than known dielectric materials. The resulting porous dielectric matrix material has low stress, low dielectric constant, low refractive index, improved toughness and improved compliance during mechanical contacting to require less contact force during compression. </paragraph>

In a multilayer integrated circuit device, an underlying layer of insulated, planarized circuit lines can also function as a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a second step in the manufacture of integrated circuits, the layer of the composition is heated to an elevated temperature to. cure the B-staged dielectric material to form a dielectric matrix material without degrading the polymeric porogen. A catalyst, such as a Br&oslash;nsted or Lewis base or Br&oslash;nsted or Lewis acid, may also be used. In a third step, the resulting cured organo polysilica dielectric matrix material is then subjected to conditions such that the porogen contained therein is substantially, removed without adversely affecting the dielectric matrix material to yield a porous organo polysilica dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The porous dielectric material is then lithographically patterned to form vias and/or trenches in subsequent processing steps. The trenches generally extend to the substrate and connect to at least one metallic via. Typically, lithographic patterning involves (i) coating the dielectric material layer with a positive or negative photoresist, such as those marketed by Shipley Company (Marlborough, Mass. ); (ii) imagewise exposing, through a mask, the photoresist to radiation, such as light of appropriate wavelength or e-beam; (iii) developing the image in the resist, e.g., with a suitable developer; and (iv) transferring the image through the dielectric layer to the substrate with a suitable transfer technique such as reactive ion beam etching. Optionally, an antireflective composition may be disposed on the dielectric material prior to the photoresist coating. Such lithographic patterning techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A metallic film is then deposited onto the patterned dielectric layer to fill the trenches. Preferred metallic materials include, but are not limited to: copper, tungsten, gold, silver, aluminum or alloys thereof. The metal is typically deposited onto the patterned dielectric layer by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include, but are not limited to: chemical vapor deposition (&ldquo;CVD&rdquo;), plasma-enhanced CVD, combustion CVD (&ldquo;CCVD&rdquo;), electro and electroless deposition, sputtering, or the like. Optionally, a metallic liner, such as a layer of nickel, tantalum, titanium, tungsten, or chromium, including nitrides or silicides thereof, or other layers such as barrier or adhesion layers, e.g. silicon nitride or titanium nitride, is deposited on the patterned and etched dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In a fifth step of the process for integrated circuit manufacture, excess metallic material is removed, e.g. by planarizing the metallic film, so that the resulting metallic material is generally level with the patterned dielectric layer. Planarization is typically accomplished with chemical/mechanical polishing or selective wet or dry etching. Such planarization methods are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides a method of preparing an integrated circuit with a closed cell porous film including the steps of: a) depositing on a substrate a layer of a composition including B-staged dielectric material having a plurality of polymeric porogens dispersed therein; b) curing the B-staged dielectric material to form a dielectric matrix material without substantially removing the porogens; c) subjecting the dielectric matrix material to conditions which at least partially remove the porogens to form a porous dielectric material layer without substantially degrading the dielectric material; d) patterning the porous dielectric layer; e) depositing a metallic film onto the patterned porous dielectric layer; and, f) planarizing the film to form an integrated circuit; wherein the porogen is substantially compatible with the B-staged dielectric material; and wherein the dielectric material is &gE;30% porous; and wherein the mean particle size of the porogens is selected to provide a closed cell pore structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the dielectric material is an organo polysilica material. Thus, the present invention also provides a method of preparing an integrated circuit with a closed cell porous film including the steps of: a) depositing on a substrate a layer of a composition including B-staged organo polysilica dielectric material having polymeric porogen dispersed therein; b) curing the B-staged organo polysilica dielectric material to form an organo polysilica dielectric matrix material without substantially removing the porogen; c) subjecting the organo polysilica dielectric matrix material to conditions which at least partially remove the porogen to form a porous organo polysilica dielectric material layer without substantially degrading the organo polysilica dielectric material; d) patterning the porous dielectric layer; e) depositing a metallic film onto the patterned porous dielectric layer; and f) planarizing the film to form an integrated circuit; wherein the porogen is substantially compatible with the B-staged organo polysilica dielectric material and wherein the porogen includes as polymerized units at least one compound selected from silyl containing monomers or poly(alkylene oxide) monomers; and wherein the dielectric material is &gE;30% porous. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 8 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The interconnectivity of the porous films from Example 7 are measured by placing a PYREX&trade;glass bail joint complete with a rubber o-ring against the thin, porous dielectric layer deposited onto a conductive silicon wafer, having a resistivity (&ldquo;R&rdquo;)&equals;&lt;0.02 Ohm-cm. The ball joint is held in place by a clamp and then an aqueous 10,000 ppm of copper (as copper nitrate) ICP standard solution in 5% nitric acid is charged into the ball joint. A platinum electrode is placed into the solution and then a second reference electrode is also inserted into the solution. The backside of the wafer, i.e. the side opposite the film, is also contacted with an electrode. A measuring or monitoring system is used to record the impedence spectra with a Solartron 1260 Gain/Phase Analyzer EG&amp;G Princeton Applied Research (PAR) 273 potentiostat/Galvanostat, and Zplot Impedance Software (available from Scribner Associates). Individual data files are fit to a modified Randles circuit, (Zsim Impedance software from Scribner Associates), and their impedance parameters are plotted and compared as a function of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The copper ICP standard solution is allowed to remain in contact with the film for 24 hours and the impedance is measured again.
