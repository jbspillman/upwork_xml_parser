<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises flat conductors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>insulated with an insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the form of a tape, while a terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projecting on the opposite sides thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected as follows: As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are stuck through the insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the opposite sides of an intended flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that more than 50% of their length may project from the insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Then, the end portions of the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that have been stuck through the insulation <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are bent inward as shown by a broken line. The insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is broken with the ends of the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>so that the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>come in contact with the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in this connecting method, depending on the length by which the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>project from the insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the way in which the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are bent, it may be difficult to break the insulation <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the ends of the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to thereby bring the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in contact with the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In that case, stable connection is not obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal in which a flat cable and a terminal can always be connected in a good and stable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal in which a flat cable and a terminal can be connected in a stable state and a cramp piece is bent into an intended shape easily. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is to improve a method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal in which a flat cable comprising a flat conductor insulated with an insulation in the form of a tape and a terminal having a cramp piece are connected by sticking the cramp piece through the flat cable at a place corresponding to an intended portion of the flat conductor, and bending the cramp piece that has been stuck through the flat cable, toward the flat conductor to clamp the flat cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention is characterized in that an end portion of the cramp piece is made to project from the flat cable by a length that is in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the length of the cramp piece, and then the end portion of the cramp piece is bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, the method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention is characterized in that an end portion of the cramp piece is made to project from the flat cable by a length that is in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the length of the cramp piece and then the end portion of the cramp piece is bent; and the cramp piece is connected with the flat conductor at a first place where the cramp piece has been stuck through the flat conductor and a second place where an inner surface of the end portion of the cramp piece that has been bent is in contact with an outer surface of a bent portion of the flat conductor that has been bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the end portion of the cramp piece is made to project from the flat cable by a length that is in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the length of the cramp piece and then bent as described above, the flat cable and the terminal can be connected in a good and stable state not only at a first place where the cramp piece has been stuck through the flat conductor but also at a second place where the inner surface of the end portion of the cramp piece that has been bent is in contact with the outer surface of a bent portion of the flat conductor. Especially at the second place, the contact is very stable, and therefore, the connection is highly reliable, because it is formed in a manner that the inner surface of the end portion of the cramp piece that has been bent is in contact with the outer surface of the bent portion of the flat conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the length by which the end portion of the cramp piece projects from the flat cable is more than 50% of the length of the cramp piece, the connection lacks stability and therefore the reliability of the connection lowers. When the length by which the end portion of the cramp piece projects from the flat cable is less than 5% of the length of the cramp piece, the end portion of the cramp piece is not bent sufficiently, so that the second connection is not formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, the method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention is characterized in that a terminal comprising a substrate with a window and a plurality of cramp pieces projecting on opposite sides of the substrate is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This method of connection ensures that the cramp piece that has been stuck through the flat cable is bent appropriately. As a result, the flat cable and the terminal can always be connected in a good and stable state.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the method according to the present invention, a terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is used. The terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a member comprising a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with a window <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a plurality of cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of an length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> projecting on the opposite sides of the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and has a cross section like a staple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected as follows: As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed on a forming cramp <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the upper surface of the forming cramp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed a bending concave portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for bending the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> inward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this state, the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having the projecting cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is pressed with a pressing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, being guided by guides <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As a result, the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are stuck through the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that have been stuck through the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are bent inward with the bending concave portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the forming cramp <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to clamp the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A characteristic feature of the method according to the present invention is that the end portion of each cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is made to project from the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a length that is in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), and then the end portion of each cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is bent. The projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by which the end portion of each cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>projects from the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) is arranged to be in the range of 50&tilde;5%, preferably 40&tilde;5% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and on that condition, the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is bent with the bending concave portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is connected with the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a first place P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> where the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has been stuck through the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and at a second place P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> where the inner surface of the end portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that has been bent is in contact with the outer surface of a bent portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that has been bent. Thus, the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be connected in a stable and good state. In addition, since the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a window <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as stated above, the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is prevented from being pressed between the end of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Especially at the second place P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; since the inner surface of the bent portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is in contact with the outer surface of the bent portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the contact is very stable, and therefore, the connection is highly reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Next, why the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be connected in a good state when the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is bent on the condition that the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is arranged to be in the range of 50&tilde;5%, preferably 40&tilde;5% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be explained in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D relate to the present invention in which the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is arranged to be in the range of 50&tilde;5%, preferably 40&tilde;5% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and show, on the basis of an experiment, how the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is bent. In other words, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D show how the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>projecting from the flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is bent when the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> shows a state in which the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has been bent into its final shape.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing the result of a thermal shock test where thermal shock of &plus;80&deg; C.&tilde;&minus;30&deg; C. was given to three kinds of samples S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> each prepared by connecting a cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>for a wide use of 2.3 mm in tab width to a flat conductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Sample S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was a comparison example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> where the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 65% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, sample S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was an embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> where the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was 35% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and sample S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> was an conventional example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it was found that the connecting portion of sample S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the present invention showed stable contact resistance relative to thermal shock. Specifically, it was found that the connecting portion showed more stable contact resistance relative to thermal shock when the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that was in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was bent than when the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that was more than 50% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graph showing the result of measurement of how contact resistance in the above-mentioned three kinds of samples S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> varied. The terminal and the flat cable are thought to be used in an environment that varies. Therefore, contact resistance in each sample was measured three times, that is, soon after the sample was prepared, after the sample was left in a high temperature for a predetermined time (100&deg; C.&times;120 hours), and after the sample was subjected to a vibration test. In the vibration test, the sample was vibrated back and forth, left and right, and up and down with 4.5 G at 20&tilde;200 Hz with a sweep time of 3 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it was found that the connecting portion of sample S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the present invention showed stable contact resistance relative to variation in temperature and vibration. Specifically, it was found that the connecting portion showed more stable contact resistance relative to variation in temperature and vibration when the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that was in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was bent than when the end portion of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>having the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that was more than 50% of the cramp piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the above description of the embodiment, an example has been dealt with where a single flat cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a terminal <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected. The method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention is however not restricted to the above-described embodiment. The present invention can be applied to the case where a plurality of flat cables <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> placed one on another are connected so that flat conductors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the flat cables <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected by cramp pieces <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also in this case, when the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece is more than 50% of the cramp piece length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the connection lacks stability and therefore the reliability of the connection lowers. When the projecting length h<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the cramp piece is less than 5% of the cramp piece length h<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the end portion of the cramp piece is not bent sufficiently, so that the stable connection cannot be formed at the second place. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention, a cramp piece and a flat conductor are connected not only at a first place where the cramp piece has been stuck through the flat conductor but also at a second place where the inner surface of an end portion of the cramp piece that has been bent is in contact with the outer surface of a bent portion of the flat conductor. Thus, the flat cable and the terminal can be connected in a good and stable state. Especially at the second place, the contact is very stable, and therefore, the connection is highly reliable, because it is formed in a manner that the inner surface of the bent end portion of the cramp piece is in contact with the outer surface of the bent portion of the flat conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the method of connecting a flat cable and a terminal according to the present invention, a bending concave portion of a forming cramp has a shape adapted to bend an end portion of a cramp piece that projects from a flat cable by a length that is in the range of 50&tilde;5% of the cramp piece length. Thus, the end portion of a cramp piece that projects from a flat cable can be bent into an intended shape, easily. </paragraph>
