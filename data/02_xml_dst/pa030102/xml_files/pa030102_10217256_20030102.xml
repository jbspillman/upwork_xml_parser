<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">This patent application relates to a process whereby a filter/sieve is produced by injecting the interactive chemicals used to form gels and polymers at reservoir temperatures independently and sequentially into a well in such a manner that the chemicals only come into contact with each other at the desired depth of penetration in the formation.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the stoppage of water flow while permitting the recovery of hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon formation in the earth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Specifically, it relates to the placement of a filter/sieve of a blocking gel or polymer at a predetermined distance from a well bore in order to stop water flow and to thereby enhance the recovery of oil and gas hydrocarbons from the formation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is well known that the economic life expectancy of commercially productive oil and gas wells is determined by the transitional change with time from the well being predominantly oil and gas producing to increasingly becoming water productive. Under the best conditions the production of oil and gas only diminishes consistent with the depletion of the contained resource and at the uneconomic high water cut point the reservoir contains both non-produced mobile oil and gas and non-mobile residual oil and gas. At this high water cut point, the well is considered to be uneconomic for production of hydrocarbon from the specific perforated reservoir formation or interval and, as a consequence, production from that reservoir formation at that well location is abandoned. The quantity of residual oil remaining at this point however, is quite significant and residual oil saturation can range anywhere from 10 pore volume percent to in excess of 50 pore volume percent of the original oil or gas in place. This estimate does not take into account any volume of bypassed oil present in the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The increasing production of water from a reservoir interval can also be attributed to other mechanisms such as water or gas coning, or early breakthrough of water or gas from high permeability zones present within the reservoir formation being produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similar remarks apply to the injection of fluids into reservoir formations; the fluid flow profiles can be homogeneous or can be channeled into the formation by preferential flow through the higher permeability zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Blockage of high permeability zones within oil and gas productive reservoir has been commonly applied in the oil and gas industry as a means of reducing unwanted water and gas flow and improving oil and gas production. Both inorganic and organic gels and polymers have been used and there are a multitude of patents applicable to this type of blockage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The common mode of operation is to inject into the well either preformed gels or polymer mixes or mixtures of chemicals which will interact at reservoir temperatures to form gels or polymer mixes with time. The ensuing plugging or blocking effects of these gels or polymers then inhibits the preferential production of water from the formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Problems most commonly experienced with the injection of preformed gels or polymer mixtures relate to inadequate depths of penetration into the formation followed by early breakdown of the blocking gel or polymer during the reverse production flow from the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Injection of mixtures of gel or polymer forming chemicals with a secondary reactive chemical which induces gelation or polymer formation at depth in the reservoir suffers mainly in one being unable to control the reaction rate such that premature reaction does not occur prior to the chemical mixture being located at the desired depth of penetration. Premature gelation or polymerization of these chemical mixtures will often occur resulting in premature blockage at short distances (less than four feet) of penetration into the formation as is the case for direct gel or polymer injection. Formation of gels and polymers during the residence time spent by the chemical mixtures in the well bore during the injection is also a problem. Attempts have been made to diminish this effect by using coiled tubing to more speedily place the chemical mixes into the formation as well as using surfactant-emulsion transport of less water soluble and slower reacting acid forming chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Previous patent coverage relates to the use of Single Well Chemical Tracer technology for the measurement of residual oil saturation of watered-out reservoir formations (U.S. Pat. No. 3,623,842 (Nov. 30, 1971); Deans, H. A.: &ldquo;Method for Determining Fluid Saturations in Reservoirs.&rdquo;) U.S. Pat. No. 4,312,635, issued to Carlisle on Jan. 26, 1982, provides background information for the determination of partition coefficients, which are discussed further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In Deans&apos; process, a volume of water (seawater, fresh water or formation water) containing a known concentration of reactive chemical tracer is injected into a watered out reservoir formation followed by the injection of a predetermined volume of water (push volume) such that the chemical tracer fluid volume is pushed into the reservoir to a desired distance. The reactive chemical tracer used is a chemical which has the ability to partition between the residual oil present as a stationary phase in the reservoir and the water phase which is moving through the reservoir consistent with the injection flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The partitioning effect between the reactive chemical and the stationary residual oil reduces the velocity of flow of the reactive chemical tracer bank relative to the water flow. Following injection of the chemical mix and the push volumes, the well is shut-in to allow the reactive chemical tracer to react with water to form a secondary nonreactive chemical product at the location of the reactive chemical tracer bank. Reaction time is controlled such that between 20-40 volume percent of the reactive tracer is converted to the secondary product tracer. Back production of the injected fluids and measurement of the returning reactive tracer and chemical product concentrations allows a determination of the accessible residual oil saturation (AS<highlight><subscript>or</subscript></highlight>) for the test interval to be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The preferred reactive chemical tracers used in the accessible residual oil saturation (AS<highlight><subscript>or</subscript></highlight>) measurement process are water soluble esters such as ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate among others. Hydrolysis of these chemicals under reservoir conditions form the corresponding acid and alcohol components making up that specific reactive tracer chemical. As a consequence of the acid formation, the hydrogen ion concentration or acidity (pH) will correspondingly increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Patents for the use of inorganic and organic gels and polymers as blocking agents in reservoir formations do exist. In most instances where inorganic gel chemicals have been used, the gel formation is initiated by mixing the gel progenitor chemical with inorganic acid or organic acid and alcohol chemicals. Chemical esters have been reported as a means of forming gels by the in situ generation of acid and alcohol components which correspondingly change the pH and initiate gelation or polymerization. However, such use of esters has only been applied to the mixing of the ester with the gel forming agent at the surface followed by co-injection of the chemicals into the reservoir. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This patent application relates to a process whereby a filter/sieve is produced by injecting the interactive chemicals used to form gels and polymers at reservoir temperatures independently and sequentially into a well in such a manner that the chemicals only come into contact with each other at the desired depth of penetration in the formation. At this location in the reservoir, which can be determined by appropriate calculation, the injection is stopped and the intermixed and superimposed chemicals are allowed to react to form the filter/sieve of a gel or polymer depending upon the nature of the individual chemicals injected. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention relates to forming a filter/sieve or a blockage zone of a gel or polymer at a desired depth of penetration in a reservoir formation that ensures blockage and prevents water breakthrough into the well. More specifically, the present invention relates to the emplacement of two (2) or more reactive chemicals at a common location at a desired depth of penetration in a reservoir formation such that ensuing chemical gelation or polymerization will form a filter/sieve or blockage zone of predetermined size in an appropriate low velocity flow environment preferentially in high water cut permeability zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention employs reactive chemical(s) which are water soluble chemical(s) having solubility in both water and oil, and which have the ability to undergo reaction at reservoir conditions to form the desired filter/sieve or block zone of gel or polymer within an underground formation at a desired distance from the well. The process employs either an organic ester and a silicate or a soluble polymer and a multivalent salt. The process is unique in that the choice of chemicals and the independent injection of the chemicals into the formation with each chemical bank being pushed further out into the formation with predetermined push volumes of fresh water, treated fresh water, seawater, treated seawater, formation water or treated formation water, results in a predetermined retardation in the flow of the reactive chemical(s) by partitioning interaction with the immobile accessible residual oil in the formation and the ensuing non-retarded flow of the gel or polymer forming chemicals resulting in the gel or polymer forming chemical bank proceeding to catch up to, and superimposing itself upon, the slower moving reactive chemical bank at a predetermined distance and thickness from the well bore and at a location ideal for low velocity flow conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In situ reaction of the reactive chemicals and gel or polymer forming chemicals at reservoir conditions and the subsequent inter-reaction of the reaction products with the gel or polymer progenitor chemicals results in the formation of a filter/sieve or blocking zone of stable gel or polymer which effectively reduces water flow from any preferentially invaded high permeability high water cut zones. A unique aspect of the location of the filter/sieve at a desired depth of penetration around a production well is that it allows the oil and/or gas to flow through the filter/sieve, blocking the water, thereby allowing commercial enhanced oil and/or gas production utilizing the in situ formation drive mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The process can have application in oil wells, gas wells, or in depleted high water cut oil and gas wells containing remaining mobile oil. For filter/sieve or blockage emplacement in formations which have no residual oil, preconditioning of the formation by oil or diesel injection followed by water flood can render the formation suitable for ensuing gel or polymer blockage according to the described process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The reservoir may be initially preconditioned by the injection of a predetermined volume of fresh water, pretreated water, seawater, pretreated seawater, formation water or pretreated formation water such that (1) any mobile oil and/or gas is displaced from the immediate reservoir interval consistent with the injection, leaving only a small amount of residual oil, or introducing a residual amount of oil if none is present and (2) the temperature of the reservoir interval is lowered to a value suitable for controlled reaction of the reactive chemicals and (3) divalent inorganic ions such as Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Mg<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> are removed from the formation waters in the volume of reservoir being used in the process since they would react prematurely with the reactant chemicals injected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For onshore wells, in many instances fresh water or pretreated water can be used for introducing the chemicals, the chemical mixture volumes, and the injection and push volumes designed for a specific filter/sieve or blockage placement. For offshore and nearshore wells, realistically only seawater is conveniently available and its preferred use is of significant economic benefit. The interaction between ungelled solutions such as sodium silicate and seawater which contains approximately 400 ppm Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> and 1350 ppm Mg<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> instantly results in the precipitation of insoluble calcium and magnesium silicates. If the seawater is treated by the injection of the appropriate molar quantity of EDTA (Ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt) immediately preceding the injection of the gel progenitor, sodium silicate, into the EDTA treated seawater stream, no reaction occurs and the gel progenitor chemical remains in solution during its subsequent placement into the reservoir zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The use of EDTA (Ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt) in this process, and made a specific part of this application, is entirely to render the use of seawater suitable for offshore well operations involving gel or polymer blockage placement at predesired locations in the reservoir interval. Since seawater is the preferred fluid of choice for use in most offshore well processes, the use of EDTA as a means of stabilizing Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Mg<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions in seawater is a claim of this patent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The chemical emplacement and the subsequent gelation or polymerization process is illustrated by a description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention in which an oil-water partitioning reactive chemical, ethyl formate, is injected into the well followed by the injection of a second, water soluble chemical, sodium silicate, along with appropriate spacer push volumes calculated to achieve the desired depth of penetration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> preconditioning volume V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of fresh water, treated water, seawater, treated seawater, formation water or treated formation water is injected into the reservoir <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as shown for ideal radial flow penetration from the well bore <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Following injection of volume V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the reactive chemical mixture <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> consisting of x volume percent of ethyl formate in the appropriate volume of water, V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is injected into the reservoir <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the same predetermined injection rate as for volume V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrate the ensuing distribution of the volume V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> fluids in the reservoir <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Because of the partitioning of the ethyl formate reactive chemical <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between the water mobile phase and the immobile residual oil phase, the velocity of flow of the ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be reduced relative to the water flow velocity and the ethyl formate chemical <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> bank will be retarded. The relative velocity flows are represented by the differently sized arrows shown on the Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the reactive chemical ester ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> injection phase, the chemical mix bank is pushed out into the reservoir by the continued injection of a predetermined volume V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of water at the established injection rate such that the intermediate location of the reactive ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be at the point required. Immediately following upon the injection of volume V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the injection of the gel progenitor sodium silicate solution at a weight percent concentration of y in water <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is started without interruption of the injection flow. The above injections of volume V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the start of the gel progenitor bank, V<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. As can be seen the velocity of flow for both these volumes are the same, are identical to that for the preflood injection volume V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and are greater than the velocity flow of the reactive ester ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which continues to be retarded by partitioning with the immobile residual oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, continued injection of the progenitor gel sodium silicate volume V<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will result in the progenitor gel sodium silicate bank <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> beginning to catch up to, and ultimately encompass, the reactive ester ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, volume V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The fluid distribution at the end of the progenitor gel sodium silicate volume V<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> injection and the start of injection of the gel chemical push volume V<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Continued injection of the gel chemical push volume, for a volume V<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will allow the progenitor gel sodium silicate bank <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to superimpose itself on top of the reactive ethyl formate chemical bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> located at the desired depth of penetration into the reservoir formation <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. The fluid distributions after the continuous injection of volumes V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and V<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B and at this point, injection of fluids is stopped and the well is shut-in. Throughout the injection phase of the process, the reactive ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will increase in concentration due to its partitioning between the accessible residual oil and the injected water flow but will also be undergoing some hydrolysis into its product components, ethanol and formic acid. Since both ethanol and formic acid have a zero partition coefficient with respect to the immobile accessible residual oil which is retarding the flow of the reactive ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the hydrolysis products will immediately assume the increased velocity flow of the unretarded carrier fluids and will move ahead of the unreacted ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As a result these chemicals too will always be in advance of the unreacted ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and hence will not cause unwanted pre-gelation of the following sodium silicate bank <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> until the desired superimposition has been achieved. The partition coefficient for ethyl formate is approximately 3.0 whereas the sodium silicate has a zero (0.0) partition coefficient. Water also has a zero (0.0) partitioning coefficient value. Another way of describing the partitioning coefficient of any chemical between oil and water is that in the case cited, ethyl formate will spend approximately three times longer in the oil phase than in the water phase during the injection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> During the shut-in period, which is determined based on the rate of hydrolysis of the reactive ester, ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the reactant concentrations of the reactive ester ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the gel progenitor sodium silicate banks <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the reactive ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is converted in situ to the component chemicals ethanol and formic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The presence of generated formic acid makes the ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> acidic at a pH of approximately 3.0-3.5 which in turn results in (1) enhanced catalytic hydrolysis of unhydrolyzed remaining ethyl formate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with further generation of formic acid and ethanol, and (2) causes subsequent gelation of the sodium silicate solution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> superimposed on top of this reactive ethyl formate-formic acid-ethanol zone <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The presence of ethanol also initiates gel formation as too does the ensuing increase in temperature of the injected fluids resulting from attaining equilibrium with reservoir temperature during the shut-in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The location of the gel blocking chemical <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or more specifically the desired formation of a filter/sieve of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> During the subsequent production of fluids from the well following the filter/sieve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> placement, one would expect the ethanol and formic acid hydrolysis products, formed during the injection phase and which moved ahead of the ethyl formate bank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, will also return towards the well bore <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. These hydrolysis products will further initiate gelation of unreacted sodium silicate gel progenitor within the pore space at the leading edge of the superimposed silicate bank <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> At a rate of 1500 bbls water per day 500 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) of waterflood seawater were injected in order (1) to remove mobile oil from the vicinity of the well-bore and (2) to cool the reservoir interval to approximately 30-35&deg; C. Injection flow was continued at 1500 bbls water per day with 300 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of seawater containing 2.0 volume percent Ethyl Formate, 0.5 volume percent Isopropanol and 0.5 volume percent Methanol. The reactive chemical volume (V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) was pushed into the reservoir with 300 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) of seawater containing the appropriate molar concentration of EDTA (Ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt) in order to chelate with the Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> and Mg<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions present in the seawater and to prevent interaction between these ions and the ungelled polymer progenitor chemical. At the same injection rate of 1500 bbls water per day, 500 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) of 3.0-10.0 weight percent ungelled sodium silicate solution in seawater, pretreated with the appropriate molar concentration of EDTA (Ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt), was injected followed by a 100 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>) seawater volume also containing the appropriate molar concentration of EDTA (Ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt). The injected waterflood (V<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), chemical banks (V<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and isolation EDTA banks (V<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) were pushed to the required distances of penetration from the well-bore by a final injection of 400 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) of untagged seawater and 100 bbls (V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>) of seawater required to fill the tubulars. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this Example, the gel formation zone would be at a distance between approximately 12.17 feet and 13.50 feet (1.33 feet thick) from the well-bore at which point the flow velocity at a production rate of 5000 BOPD would be at 0.1 feet per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the above example, rw(ft) refers to the radial distance of penetration from the well bore following the respective injected accumulative volume of fluid. Hence, the last injected volume, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, only displaces the well bore volume (100 bbls) and the radial distance of penetration into the reservoir is zero. Similarly, the maximum radial distance of fluid penetration, 23.35 feet, is computed on the accumulative test injection volume of 2,200 bbls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The re(ft) refers to the distance of penetration achieved by the reactive chemical bank at its leading edge and at its trailing edge following its retardation resulting from its partitioning action with the immobile accessible residual oil in the formation. The computed re(ft) values for the ethyl formate allows one to calculate the filter/sieve or gel blockage thickness at the distance required in the reservoir. </paragraph>

Ethyl formate rates of hydrolysis at reservoir temperatures between 35&deg; C.-50&deg; C., will be approximately 0.3 days<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>; i.e. a measurable amount of the Ethyl Formate will already have reacted prior to coming into contact with the gel forming chemical bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Increasing the rate of injection of the specified volumes to 3000 BWPD or 5000 BWPD will only result in reduction in the injection times to 0.73 and 0.44 (3000 rate), and 0.93 and 0.56 days (5000 rate) respectively. Clearly the degree of hydrolysis will be correspondingly reduced prior to mixing of the chemicals in the reservoir. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As can be seen the filter/sieve or gel blockage zone would be at 22.04 feet to 28.67 feet (6.63 feet thick) with the gel progenitor overlying the reactant zone at 20.64 feet to 29.19 feet (8.55 feet thick). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Using the process which is the subject of this patent, it is clear that the placement of gels or polymers at desired locations in the reservoir is exact and can readily be achieved by this process with accuracies far in advance of any other gel or polymer formation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> It will be readily appreciated that this invention features several specific advantages. First, the invention allows the operator to predetermine the location of the filter/sieve or blocking gel or polymer at a specific depth in the reservoir formation. Second, the invention allows the operator to determine the thickness of the filter/sieve or blocking zone. Third, the invention gives the operator greater control over the placement and thickness of the filter/sieve or blocking gels or polymers than ever before. The reactive chemicals participating in the gel or polymer formation are independently injected into the reservoir, and the volumes and concentrations can be accurately controlled to achieve the desired results. Fourth, by design, the previously ubiquitous problem of premature chemical reaction is not possible in the practice of the invention. The gel or polymer forming chemicals only come into contact with one another at the predetermined location and depth in the reservoir. Fifth, the placement of the blocking gel or polymer chemicals will be preferentially located in high permeability zones present in the reservoir formation. As a consequence, unwanted water flow into and out of these high permeability zones will be preferentially diminished once gelation or polymerization and formation of the filter/sieve or blockage has occurred. Sixth, all chemical solutions used in this process have low viscosity values between 1 and 5 cps (centipoises) and hence behave in a manner close to water itself. Injection of these low viscosity fluids will take place preferentially into the high permeability high water cut zones from which water production is the greatest. These high water cut zones are the target for effective and long lasting blockage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> An additional comment about the advantage of precise placement is in order. The placement of the blocking gel at a selected depth of penetration into the reservoir formation can be made at a location where the average (or, superficial) velocity of injected or produced flow can be ideal for minimal physical destruction of or breakdown of, the blocking gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For example, the velocity flow profile of injection or production rates of 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 5000 and 10,000 barrels of water per day (for a 10 meter (32.81 feet), 1.0 darcy permeability 0.30 porosity sand interval) versus depth of penetration into the reservoir in feet, are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. At distances of 4 feet into the formation velocities range from less than 0.05 feet per minute for the 1000 BWPD case to in excess of 0.4 feet per minute for the 10,000 BWPD rate. The flow velocities increase quite rapidly from a radius of 2 feet to the well bore. Note that, at distances of 20 feet from the well bore, flow velocities are significantly lower (i.e., less than 0.05 to 0.1 feet per minute). The invention makes it possible to effectively and confidently place the blocking gel at just such a distance or greater if desired. The result is an accurately placed filter/sieve or gel, which will more effectively block fluid over time, because the aggregate (or, superficial) fluid flow rate through the blocking gel will be lower. There will inherently be fewer problems of breakdown and/or water breakthrough in wells treated according to this emplacement process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The emplacement process also has novel and unique features applicable to the sequential injection of chemical mixture banks and spacer push volumes consisting of, but not necessarily limited to, a water soluble crosslinkable gel or polymer component or a mixture of water soluble crosslinkable gel or polymer components, a water soluble crosslinking agent or mixture of crosslinking agents, a water soluble polymerization catalyst or mixture of catalysts, a retarding or sequestering anion or anion mixture and appropriate spacer mixture of reactive or nonreactive chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, no mention has been made of using knowledge of the partitioning characteristics between accessible immobile residual oil in the reservoir and crosslinkable chemical components, crosslinking chemical agents or other chemicals used in the formation of inorganic and organic gels and polymer blocking systems, as a means of controlling the fluid flow injection velocities to achieve in situ emplacement of the reactive chemicals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Using the injection method illustrated in Examples 1-4, and the appropriate volumes and chemical concentrations and rates of injection needed to achieve the desired placement of the filter/sieve in the reservoir formation, V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, of a polymer reactive chemical, such as polyacrylamide, is first injected into the formation, followed by a spacer volume, V<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and a second chemical volume, V<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, comprising a mixture of an organic acid, such as acetic acid, and a crosslinking multivalent cationic salt , such as chromium nitrate, followed by the required push volumes. In this example a crosslinked filter/sieve is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The order of sequential injection of the various reactive water soluble chemical banks and spacer push volumes will be totally determined by the partition coefficient value measured for each water soluble chemical component and the accessible residual oil saturation (AS<highlight><subscript>or</subscript></highlight>) of the receiving formation. These partition coefficient values can be measured for the specific oil system and for the specific chemical components being used. The higher the partition coefficient for any injected chemical, the slower will be its movement through the reservoir since its residence time in the immobile oil phase will be greater. For chemicals sequentially injected into a formation, and for which each has a partition coefficient value, K<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, (K<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&gt;K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) then the order of injection would be that chemical which has the higher partition coefficient first (K<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) followed by the chemical with the lower partition coefficient (K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The rate of retardation of the two (2) chemicals will be a function of the difference between the two partition coefficients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Applications of the Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The ability to place an efficient stable gel blockage at a predetermined distance into a reservoir formation primarily sealing or controlling fluid flow through the high permeability zones and at a distance where the velocity of fluid flow is such that the integrity of the gel is effectively maintained for high volume fluid injection and production flow rates, has three (3) major applications (1) production fluid control (2) injection fluid control (3) sand and mineral fines production control; i.e. (a) in oil and gas producing wells which penetrate productive reservoir formations, (b) in high water cut oil and gas producing wells which are now in watered out reservoir formations which still contain mobile residual oil and gas, (c) in high volume flow&mdash;high injection rate water injection wells. The use of this technology is not however limited to only the three (3) major applications foreseen at this time but has direct application for any function which requires fluid flow controls in oil and gas wells, to be abandoned oil and gas wells and in abandoned oil and gas wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> One preferred application of the process described herein is to use the process as a means of effectively and preferentially blocking, by gel or polymer formation, the high permeability zones in which preferential water breakthrough has occurred thereby diminishing the production of oil and/or gas from the productive reservoir interval. Placing blockage at preferred depths of penetration preferentially in the high permeability zones will allow ensuing diminished water production with an improved sweep of oil through and from the less permeable strata. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A second preferred application of the process is in the treating of oil and gas production wells in which water or gas coning has occurred close to the well bore thereby diminishing the production of oil and gas due to the preferred flow of formation water. Placement of a gel or polymer block at the base or sides of the water or gas cone will enable selective removal of the water or gas cone by appropriate treatment with suitable water solubilizing or gas solubilizing chemicals to be made. Following removal of the cone effect, bringing the well back onto production at non-coning conditions will allow oil and/or gas production to be re-established from the previously nonproductive reservoir interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A third preferred application of the process is in the control and prevention of sand production from the producing interval. Sand production associated with oil and gas production is extremely costly in terms of the severe erosive effects of the sand flow on valves, tubing and both down hole and surface equipment. Placement of a suitable gel blockage at preferred depths in the reservoir formation can effectively diminish high velocity flow through high permeability zones within the reservoir formation as well as diminishing sand flow by essentially forming a uniformly low permeability sand barrier blockage around the well at low velocity flow locations. Similarly, certain gel placement conditions whereby the gel is preferentially set up close to the well bore, can also be used to diminish sand flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A fourth preferred application of the process is in the control of mineral fines production such as Kaolinite production associated with various types of reservoir formation damage. The movement of inorganic clay-related and other inorganic mineral-related fines can effectively diminish the reservoir formation permeability characteristics particularly associated with unfavorably high velocity flow of fluids close to the well bore. Placement of a suitably located gel blockage at preferred depth in the reservoir can effectively diminish the movement of mineral fines and thereby diminish the undesired clogging of the reservoir permeability channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A fifth preferred application of the process is in the improvement of reservoir formation injection water flow whereby the placing of an effective blocking gel present within the high permeability or channel zones present in the formation will allow a more effective sweep of injection water through the less permeable intervals of the reservoir formation thereby improving oil and gas mobility drive towards productive wells. Location of the gel blockage at low velocity water flow distances from the well bore provides a condition whereby the physical stability of the gel will not be compromised by the fluid flow velocity or drive energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A sixth preferred application relates specifically to the blockage of water flow from gas wells by first injecting oil or diesel into the reservoir and then intentionally reducing the oil content to a waterflood residual oil level by flood injection thereby rendering the reservoir suitable for the desired injection requirements of this embodiment. This process could rejuvenate a water producing gas well back to gas production. </paragraph>
