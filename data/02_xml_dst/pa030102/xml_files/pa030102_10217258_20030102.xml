<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for preparing them and to their use in treating medical disorders. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,723 (Beecham Group plc) describes paroxetine hydrochloride hemi-hydrate and its use in treating certain medical disorders. Example 8 in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,723 describes the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate as platelets, by crystallization from a water-containing solvent. This material is hereinafter referred to as Form Z. Subsequent repetition of the preparation described in Example 8 has failed to yield any type of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate, and there is no clear teaching elsewhere in the document of any alternative route or modification to the process which would generate the anhydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is also purported to be disclosed in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics 42, (1988) 135 to 143, published by Elsevier. The anhydrate is said to be produced by crystallizing paroxetine hydrochloride from anhydrous propan-2-ol. Subsequent repetition of this process has resulted in a propan-2-ol solvate of paroxetine hydrochloride. That is to say that there is bound propan-2-ol in the product. This bound propan-2-ol cannot be removed by conventional drying techniques such as vacuum oven drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol, has not been described in the literature, nor has any method been disclosed which would yield such a product as an inevitable result. A method for preparing paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol has now been found. Furthermore, surprisingly, four new forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate have been found as have processes for their preparation. These forms are hereinafter referred to as A, B, C and D respectively. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of propan-2-ol with the proviso that it is other than Form Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Substantially free of bound organic solvent is to be interpreted to be less than the amount of propan-2-ol which would remain solvated, i.e., bound, within the crystal lattice of the product under conventional vacuum oven drying conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride solvates other than the propan-2-ol solvate as precursors in the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent. Examples of such solvates include solvates from alcohols (other than propan-2-ol) such as propan-1-ol and ethanol; solvates from organic acids such as acetic acid; solvates from organic bases such as pyridine; solvates from nitriles such as acetonitrile; solvates from ketones such as acetone and butanone; solvates from ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and solvates from chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and solvates of hydrocarbons such as toluene.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Generally, all percentages indicated herein are on a weight for weight basis unless otherwise stated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferred forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol or substantially free of bound organic solvent include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> i) paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form A; (as hereinafter defined) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> ii) paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form B; (as hereinafter defined) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate may be distinguished from each other and the material formed as a result of carrying out the procedures mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,723 and the International Journal of Pharmaceutics 42, (1988), 135 to 143, by crystalline shape, by solvent analysis or by techniques such as IR, melting point, X-ray diffraction, NMR, DSC, microscopy and any other analytical techniques which differentiate one form from another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For example, Form A substantially free of solvent may be distinguished over Form Z by its crystalline shape (Form A: needles; Form Z: platelets) and is also characterized by the following analytical data. Form A has a melting point of about 123-125&deg; C. when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 1 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and significant IR bands (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at about 513, 538, 571, 592, 613, 665, 722, 761, 783, 806, 818, 839, 888, 906, 924, 947, 966, 982, 1006, 1034, 1068, 1091, 1134, 1194, 1221, 1248, 1286, 1340, 1387, 1493, 1513, 1562, 1604, 3402, 3631 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The DSC exotherm, measured at 10&deg; C. per minute shows a maximum at about 126&deg; C. using an open pan and a maximum at about 121&deg; C. using a closed pan. Form A also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for example there are characteristic peaks at 6.6, 8.0, 11.2, 13.1 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C-NMR spectrum to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for example with characteristic peaks at 154.3, 149.3, 141.6, 138.5 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Form B substantially free of solvent may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data, i.e., it has a melting point of about 138&deg; C. when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 7 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and significant IR bands (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) at about 538, 574, 614, 675, 722, 762, 782, 815, 833, 884, 925, 938, 970, 986, 1006, 1039, 1069, 1094, 1114, 1142, 1182, 1230, 1274, 1304, 1488, 1510, 1574, 1604, 1631 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The DSC exotherm, measured at 10&deg; C. per minute, shows a maximum of about 137&deg; C. in both open and closed pans. Form B also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for example, there are characteristic peaks at 5.7, 11.3, 12.4, 14.3 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C-NMR spectrum to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for example with characteristics peaks at 154.6, 148.3, 150.1, 141.7, 142.7, 139.0 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Form C may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data, i.e. it has a melting point of about 164&deg; C. when obtain in similar purity to the material described in Example 8 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and has significant IR bands (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) at about 540, 574, 615, 674, 720, 760, 779, 802, 829, 840, 886, 935, 965, 984, 1007, 1034, 1092, 1109, 1139, 1183, 1218, 1240, 1263, 1280, 1507, 1540, 1558, 1598, 1652 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The DSC exotherm, measured at 10&deg; C. per minute, shows a maximum of about 161&deg; C. in both open and closed pans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Form C also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for example there are characteristic peaks at 10.1, 12.1, 13.1, 14.3 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C-NMR spectrum to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, for example with characteristic peaks at 154.0, 148.5, 143.4, 140.4 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Form D may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data in that it exists as a semi-crystalline solid with a melting point of about 125&deg; C. when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 14 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Form D may also be characterized in that it has essentially similar physical characteristics when prepared from a toluene precursor solvate using methods generally described herein said toluene precursor solvate having significant IR bands at about 1631, 1603, 1555, 1513, 1503, 1489, 1340, 1275, 1240, 1221, 1185, 1168, 1140, 1113, 1101, 1076, 1037, 1007, 986, 968, 935, 924, 885, 841, 818, 783, 760, 742, 720, 698, 672, 612, 572, 537 and 465 cm&minus;1, and characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks at 7.2, 9.3, 12.7 and 14.3 degrees 2 theta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The question of which particular form a particular sample of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is would be readily determined by one skilled in the art using conventional techniques with reference to the data provided above that given in the examples and any other conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Preferably forms A and B exist as needles and form C exits as needles or prisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of propan-2-ol which comprises crystallizing paroxetine hydrochloride in either; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> thereafter in the case of i) displacing the solvated solvent or solvents using a displacing agent and in the case of ii) by removing the solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the paroxetine hydrochloride solvates other than the propan-2-ol solvate which comprises crystallizing paroxetine hydrochloride in an organic solvent or mixture of solvents which form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride and which are not removable by conventional drying techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent which comprises crystallizing paroxetine hydrochloride in an organic solvent and displacing the solvated solvent or solvents from the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate using a displacing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one preferred aspect of the invention crystallization of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is achieved by contacting a solution of paroxedine free base in an organic solvent or solvents with dry hydrogen chloride gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, prior to the crystallization of the paroxetine hydrochloride water may be removed from a solution of the paroxetine hydrochloride by azeotropic distillation of the solution. Suitable solvents therefore include those which form an azeotrope with water such as pyridine, toluene, and propan-2-ol. It should also be appreciated that mixtures of solvents can also be used to aid the azeotropic removal of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thus, in another aspect of the invention paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is crystallized by dissolving paroxetine hydrochloride hemi-hydrate in an appropriate solvent substantially free of water which forms an azeotrope with water. Suitably solvent is removed by distillation and fresh solvent substantially free of water is added until all of the water is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Paroxetine hydrochloride hemi-hydrate or the free base thereof may be prepared according to the procedures generally outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,723. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The organic solvents should be substantially free of water to the extent that there is insufficient water present at the time of crystallization to effect conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate. Organic solvents which are substantially free of water may be obtained in conventional manner. For example they can be dried using conventional techniques such as drying over molecular sieves or they can be purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Factors which affect which form of the product that will be obtained include the particular choice of organic solvent or solvents. It should also be appreciated that the method of solvent removal also affects the particular form of the product which is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> For process variant i) it should be appreciated that the organic solvent or solvents which form a solvate with the crystallized paroxetine hydrochloride and which are not removable by conventional drying techniques may be determined by a matter of routine experimentation. Examples of such organic solvents include, but in no way are limited to, alcohols especially alkanols such as propan-2-ol, ethanol and propan- 1-ol; organic acids such as acetic acid; organic bases such as pyridine; nitrites such as acetonitrile; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The paroxetine hydrochloride solvate produced by process variant i) is suitably isolated and dried by conventional methods such as drying in vacuo to remove some or all of the free or unbound solvent. It should be appreciated that it is preferable and unexpected that the degree of drying is controlled such that only free solvent is removed. The bound solvent is then displaced with a displacing agent such as water or supercritical carbon dioxide. It is possible to use other displacing agents which may be selected by means of routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Preferably gaseous or liquid water may be used as a displacing agent. It is important that the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate is contacted with enough water and for sufficient time to displace the solvent but insufficient to cause conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The amount of water, the form of the water, e.g., liquid or gaseous and the length of time which the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate is contacted with the water differs from solvate to solvate. This depends largely upon the solubility of the solvate in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Particular ratios of paroxetine hydrochloride solvate to water are outlined in the examples hereinafter described (Examples 1, 4 to 6, 9 to 11, 13 and 15). It should be appreciated that the pyridine solvate is believed to be more soluble in water than for example the propan-2-ol solvate. Thus the use of the common ion effect when using diluted hydrochloric acid may help prevent dissolution of the solvate and subsequent conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After contact with water to displace the bound solvent the product is suitably dried, for example, in vacuo at elevated temperature. Suitable drying may be over a desiccant such as phosphorus pentoxide or potassium hydroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When supercritical carbon dioxide is used it should be appreciated that the flow rate, temperature and pressure of the carbon dioxide may be controlled to give optimum solvent removal from the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate. Generally high pressure carbon dioxide may be used for example at about 2,500 psi. Elevated temperatures may also be preferably used such as between 50 to 80&deg; C. More preferable between 55 to 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Process variant i) is preferably used to prepare Form A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Preferably the crystallization of the paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvate may be facilitated by the addition of seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A may be used to facilitate the crystallization of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For process variant ii) it should be appreciated that an organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents which does or does not form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride but which is removable by conventional vacuum oven drying may be determined by a matter of routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An example of a solvent which forms a bound solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride but which is removable by conventional vacuum oven drying is toluene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Toluene is preferably used to prepare Form D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The crystallization of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates may be facilitated by the addition of seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D may be used to facilitate the crystallization of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Examples of solvents which do not form a bound solvate with paroxetine hydrochloride but which are removable by conventional vacuum oven drying are butan-1-ol and ethyl acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Butan-1-ol is preferably used to prepare Form B and that butan-1-ol or ethyl acetate are preferably used to prepare Form C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If Form B is required this may be prepared according to or analogously to the procedures outlined in Example 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Preferably the use of seeds of Form B may be used to facilitate the crystallization of Form B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If Form C is required this may be prepared according to or analogously to the procedures outlined in Examples 8 and 12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that the use of seeds of Form C may be used to facilitate the crystallization of Form C. </paragraph>
