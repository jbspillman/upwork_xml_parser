<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This is a Continuation-In-Part application of International Patent Application serial No.09/971,943 filed on Oct. 9, 2001 now pending. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a scintillator panel and radiation image sensor which are used for medical X-ray photography or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While X-ray sensitive films have conventionally been used in medical and industrial X-ray photography, radiation imaging systems using radiation detectors have been coming into widespread use from the viewpoint of convenience and storability of photographed results. In such a radiation imaging system, pixel data caused by two-dimensional radiation are acquired as an electric signal by a radiation detector, and this signal is processed by a processing unit, so as to be displayed on a monitor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally known as a typical radiation detector is one having a structure in which a scintillator panel comprising a scintillator formed on a substrate made of aluminum, glass, fused silica, or the like and an imaging device are cemented together. In this radiation detector, the radiation entering from the substrate side is converted by the scintillator into visible light, which is then detected by the imaging device (see JP7-21560A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, though it is necessary for the scintillator panel to have a sufficiently high optical output in order to attain clear images in a radiation detector, the optical output has not been sufficient in the above-mentioned radiation detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a scintillator panel having an enhanced optical output, and a radiation image sensor using a scintillator panel having an enhanced optical output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A scintillator panel according to the present invention comprises (1) a radiation-transmitting substrate, (2) a light reflective metal thin film disposed on the substrate, (3) a protective film covering an entire surface of the reflective metal thin film, and (4) a scintillator deposited on the protective film. And the protective film has a function to protect the reflective metal thin film against the scintillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the scintillator panel of the present invention, since the entire surface of the reflective metal thin film is covered with the protective film, any decomposition of this thin film based on water contained in the scintillator in a small amount can be prevented, and any degradation in function of the reflective metal thin film as a reflecting film can be prevented. Hence, an increased optical output of the scintillator panel can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another scintillator panel of the present invention comprises (1) a radiation-transmitting substrate, (2) a reflective metal thin film disposed on the substrate, (3) a protective film disposed on the reflective metal thin film, and (4) a scintillator deposited on the protective film at a position except an edge portion thereof. The reflective metal thin film transmits radiation and reflects light irradiated from the scintillator, and has a function to protect the reflective metal thin film against the scintillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to this scintillator panel, since the scintillator and reflective metal thin film are separated, any decomposition of this film based on water contained in the scintillator in a small amount can be prevented, and any degradation in function of the reflective metal thin film as a reflecting film can be prevented. Hence, an increased optical output of the scintillator panel can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The reflective film may be directly or indirectly disposed on the substrate. And the reflective film may be substantially made of a material containing a substance selected from the group consisting of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, Rh, Pt, and Au. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The protective film may be an inorganic film like a metal oxide film or an organic film like polyimide. The inorganic film may be substantially made of a material containing a substance selected for the group consisting of LiF, MgF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, MgO, SiN. Or the metal oxide film may be an oxidized material of the reflective metal thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The protective film preferably comprises an inorganic film such as SiN and an organic film such as polyimide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The scintillator may be covered with an organic film. According to this configuration, the water-vapor resistance of the scintillator can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the organic film further covers at least an outer periphery of said protective film. According to this configuration, the organic film covers over the scintillator and the outer periphery of said protective film and reaches to the surface of the substrate around the protective film. Whereby the water-vapor resistance of the scintillator can be further improved as compared to a structure in which only the scintillator is covered with an organic film. And the scintillating material depositing outside the scintillator layer is prevented to contact with the reflective metal thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If this organic film further covers an entire surface of the substrate then it is preferable to further improve the water-vapor resistance as compared to a structure in which only the scintillator and at least part of the substrate surface are covered with an organic film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A radiation image sensor according to the present invention is characterized in that an image sensing element is arranged to face the scintillator of the scintillator panel. According to the radiation image sensor of the present invention, since the scintillator panel can maintain an increased optical output, the output of the radiation image sensor can be maintained.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a light-reflecting film (reflective metal thin film) is disposed on one surface of an amorphous carbon (a-C) (glassy carbon or glass-like carbon) substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The surface of the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is covered with an SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for protecting the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure, which converts incident radiation into visible light, is made on the surface of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Tl-doped CsI is used as the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> together with the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a structure in which an image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is bonded to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The making process of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described. First, an Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a light-reflecting film is formed to a thickness of 150 nm on one surface of a rectangular or circular a-C substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (thickness: 1 mm) by vacuum deposition. An SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 200 nm on the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by plasma CVD to cover the entire surface of the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A columnar crystal of Tl-doped CsI is grown (deposited) on the surface of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by deposition, thereby forming a scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 250 &mgr;m. CsI that forms the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has high hygroscopicity, and if the scintillator is kept exposed, it absorbs vapor in air and deliquesces. To prevent this deliquescence, a polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD. That is, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed is placed in a CVD apparatus, and a polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited to a thickness of 10 &mgr;m. With the above process, the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (the entire substrate surface that is exposed without any scintillator or the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is manufactured by bonding the light-receiving portion of the image sensing element (CCD) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the completed scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, radiation incident from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side is converted into light by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and detected by the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a reflective metal thin film, the light incident on the light-receiving portion of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be increased, and a clear image can be detected by the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, since the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wholly covered with the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that functions as a protective film for the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the function for a reflecting film of the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being damaged by decomposition due to corrosion or the like. Furthermore, when the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is deposited the CsI deposits not only on the region on the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> but also deposits outside of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, the outer periphery of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is covered over the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the CsI which deposits outside of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cannot intrude into the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and cannot contact with Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. So the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is effectually protected against the CsI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment of the present invention will be described next. In the second embodiment to be described below, the same reference numerals as in the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment denote the same components in the second embodiment. </paragraph>

The surface of the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is covered with a polyimide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for protecting the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure, which converts incident radiation into visible light, is formed on the surface of the polyimide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Tl-doped CsI is used as the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> together with the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A radiation image sensor is constructed by bonding an image sensing element to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The making process of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described. First, an Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a light-reflecting film is formed to a thickness of 150 nm on one surface of a rectangular or circular a-C substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (thickness: 1 mm) by vacuum deposition. A polyimide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 1,000 nm on the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a spin coat process to cover the entire surface of the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A columnar crystal of Tl-doped CsI is grown on the surface of the polyimide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by deposition, thereby forming a scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 250 &mgr;m. CsI that forms the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has high hygroscopicity, and if the scintillator is kept exposed, it absorbs vapor in air and deliquesces. To prevent this deliquescence, the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD. That is, the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The radiation image sensor is manufactured by bonding the light-receiving portion of an image sensing element (CCD) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the completed scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to the radiation image sensor using the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, radiation incident from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side is converted into light by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and detected by the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the radiation image sensor has the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a reflective metal thin film, the light incident on the light-receiving portion of the image sensing element can be increased, and a clear image can be detected by the radiation image sensor. In addition, since the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is wholly covered with the polyimide film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that functions as a protective film for the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film can be prevented from being damaged in function by a decomposition due to corrosion or the like. </paragraph>

An SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for protecting the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire surface of the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure, which converts an incident radiation into visible light, is formed on the surface of the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed at a position except the edge portion on the SiN film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> located on the outer side is separated from the edge portion of the Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, an a-C substrate is used. However, since the substrate only need to pass radiation, a graphite substrate, Al substrate, Be substrate, or glass substrate may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, when an Al oxide film on the substrate is used as a protective film, a polyimide film as a protective film is also preferably formed on the oxide film.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, an SiN film or polyimide film is used as a protective film. However, the present invention is not limited to this. A film made of a material containing a substance selected from the group consisting of transparent inorganic films such as LiF, MgF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, MgO, and SiN and a transparent organic film such as polyimide may be used. Alternatively, a protective film formed from inorganic and organic films may be used, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. That is, in a scintillator panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an Ag film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a light-reflecting film is formed on one surface of an a-C substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, an Ag film or Al film is used as a reflective metal thin film. However, a film made of a material containing a substance selected from the group consisting of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, Rh, Pt, and Au may be used. In addition, two or more reflective metal thin films may be formed by forming, e.g., an Au film on a Cr film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, when a film made of a material containing a substance selected from the group consisting of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, Rh, and Pt is used as a reflective metal thin film, an oxide film thereof can be used as a protective film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, the entire surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and substrate (the surface with the scintillator formed and a surface on the opposite side, i.e., the radiation incident surface) are covered with the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thereby making the scintillator completely resistant against water vapor. When the entire surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and at least part of the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are covered with the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the water-vapor resistance of the scintillator can be made higher than in a case wherein only the scintillator is covered. </paragraph>

In the fifth embodiment to be described below, the same reference numerals as in the scintillator panels <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first and second embodiments denote the same components in the fifth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> scintillator panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a glass substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a flat shape. An Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film is formed to a thickness of 100 nm on one surface of the substrate by vacuum deposition. A 250-&mgr;m thick scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure, which converts an incident radiation into visible light, is formed on the surface of the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Tl-doped CsI grown by deposition is used for the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The entire surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a 10-&mgr;m thick polyparaxylylene film (transparent organic film) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed by CVD, together with the substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A radiation image sensor has a structure in which an image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is bonded to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> According to the radiation image sensor of this embodiment, radiation incident from the substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> side is converted into light by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and detected by the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the radiation image sensor has the Al film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film, the light incident on the light-receiving portion of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be increased, and a clear image can be detected by the radiation image sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The substrate used for the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is preferably made thin to increase the radiation transmittance. When a glass substrate is used, a given rigidity can be ensured as compared to an Al substrate or a-C substrate even when the panel size is increased as in a scintillator panel used for a radiation image sensor for chest. For this reason, any deflection of the substrate can be prevented in forming a scintillator on the glass substrate. Hence, the scintillator can easily be formed on the substrate, and the quality of the formed scintillator can be maintained. As a type of glass to be used for the glass substrate of this embodiment, Pyrex glass is preferably used because of its cost and a small content of radiation absorbing component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described next. In the sixth embodiment to be described below, the same reference numerals as in the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and radiation image sensor of the fifth embodiment denote the same components in the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> scintillator panel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has a glass substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having a flat shape. A Cr film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film is formed to a thickness of 100 nm on one surface of the substrate by vacuum deposition. An Au film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the Cr film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a 250-&mgr;m thick scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure is formed on the surface of the Au film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Tl-doped CsI grown by deposition is used as the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The entire surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a 10-&mgr;m thick polyparaxylylene film (transparent organic film) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed by CVD, together with the substrate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A radiation image sensor has a structure in which an image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is bonded to the distal end portion side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Since the reflecting film of the scintillator panel according to this embodiment is formed from the Cr film <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with good adhesion to the glass substrate and the Au film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with good bonding to Cr, the reflecting film can have high stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, a film made of a material containing a substance selected from the group consisting of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, Rh, Pt, and Au may be used as a reflective metal thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Next, the seventh embodiment of the present invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the seventh embodiment, and FIG. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a sectional view of the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is used in the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> polyimide intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed on one surface of the amorphous carbon (a-C) (glassy carbon or glass-like carbon) substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by adhesion, and a metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which functions as a light-reflecting film is formed on the surface of this intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by adhesion. This metal thin film is manufactured from Al, for example. The surface of this metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is covered by a polyimide protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for protecting the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between, and thus sealed by, the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to which it is adhered. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a columnar structure, which converts incident radiation into visible light, is formed on the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In other words, the structure of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is such that a large number of columnar crystals stand grouped together on the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Further, a Tl-doped CsI is used in the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as well as the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is covered with a polyparaxylylene moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a configuration in which the light-receiving surface of an image-sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is affixed to the side of the scintlillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, the making process for the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be explained. First, polyimide resin is painted onto one surface of the rectangular or circular a-C substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (thickness: 1 mm) at a constant thickness (10&mgr;m) and caused to harden, thereby becoming adhered to the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and forming the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> with a flat surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which functions as a light-reflecting film is formed on the surface of this intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 150 nm by vacuum deposition. The polyimide constituting the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a good affinity with the Al metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and hence, the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes adhered to the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Since the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is also adhered to the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, peeling away of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, spin coat processing is applied onto the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus forming a polyimide protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 1000 nm which covers the entire metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so as to be adhered to and sealed by both, and hence can be effectively protected from damage or peeling in the subsequent making process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Next, a large number of Tl-doped CsI columnar crystals are grown (accumulated) by deposition on the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so as to stand grouped together, thereby forming the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 250 &mgr;m. The CsI that forms the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has high hygroscopicity, and if left exposed, absorbs vapor in the air and deliquesces. In order to prevent this, the polyparaxylylene moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD. That is, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed is inserted into a CVD device, and the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed at a thickness of 10 m. The making method for this moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is described in detail in International Publication No. WO99/66351. Thereby, the polyparaxylylene moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed on substantially the entire surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or in other words, substantially the entire surface of the substrate that is exposed and does not have a scintillator or the like formed thereon. According this process the protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is not formed at positions corresponding to the support protrusions of a target-support element each of which supports the substrate during CVD process. The words &ldquo;substantially the entire surface&rdquo; means almost entire surfaces except these portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made by disposing the light-receiving portion of an image sensing element (CCD) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to face the distal end side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the completed scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and bonding them (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> According to the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of this embodiment, radiation which enters from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side is converted into light by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and detected by the image sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since the light-reflecting metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided in the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprising the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the amount of light incident on the light-receiving portion of the image-sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be increased, and the image detected by the radiation image sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be made clearer. Further, since the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adhered to the polyimide intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and thus sandwiched between the two to seal the entire film, damage to the function of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film due to deterioration such as corrosion, peeling, or other impairments, can be prevented, and the stability thereof as a reflecting film can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an eighth embodiment of the scintillator panel in accordance with the present invention. This scintillator panel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>differs from the first embodiment in that the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not cover the entire surface of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but rather covers only the central part of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment also, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed only on the surface of the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and thus the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is completely prevented from contacting the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment also, at least the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formation part of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between, and sealed by, the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and hence, damage, peeling, deterioration and the like can be effectively prevented, and the stability of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a reflecting film can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the ninth embodiment of the scintillator panel in accordance with the present invention. This scintillator panel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>differs from those of the seventh and eighth embodiments, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</cross-reference>, in that a polyparaxylylene film which is the same as the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is used as the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Furthermore, the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>covers the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>covers the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the exposed intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the periphery of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the case of the aforementioned moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed by CVD, thus forming a satisfactory thin film that is uniform and has no pin holes or the like. As a result the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sealed, and contact with the outside air and the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is formed on the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is completely prevented, and thereby, reactions of the metal with scintillator components and moisture can be suppressed. In particular, during the formation of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>completely covers the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus even the effects of the scintillator components becoming attached to another location can be suppressed. Furthermore, by interposing the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which is a nonconductor, between the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which have conducting properties, electrical contact between the substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be prevented, and electric corrosion of the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be effectively suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Here, an embodiment was explained in which the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>cover the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; however, it is sufficient if the metal thin film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be formed on only the formation surface side of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the substrate. It is also sufficient if the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed on at least the formation surface part of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as in the eighth embodiment. However, if a structure such as that of the present embodiment is employed, wherein the intermediate film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the protective film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>cover the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, sealing is improved, and the formation of the films by CVD is simple, and therefore this structure is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A tenth embodiment of the scintillator panel in accordance with the present invention will now be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on one surface of the radiolucent substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (made of a material in which the main component is glass, amorphous carbon, or another carbon). This metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a material containing one of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, or Rh. A protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed so as to envelop the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from above the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made, for example, from polyparaxylylene. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which converts into visible light incident radiation that has passed through the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the portion of the surface where the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are laminated. A Tl-doped CsI, for example, is used in this scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The CsI has a configuration in which a large number of needle crystals stand grouped together. This scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as well as the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is covered by a moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of polyparaxylylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Next, the making process of this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18, 19A</cross-reference> through <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>D, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. First, a rectangular or circular substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (thickness: 1 mm) is prepared (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</cross-reference>), and the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on a surface thereof at a thickness of 150 nm by vacuum deposition (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Next, the polyparaxylylene protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by CVD. In other words, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> deposited thereon is inserted into a CVD device, whereby the moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed over the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 10 &mgr;m. As a result, the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is covered, and the polyparaxylylene protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed covering substantially the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, from the periphery of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the side walls and moreover to the rear surface thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</cross-reference>). This organic film making method is described in detail in International Publication No. WO99/66351. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a large number of Tl-doped CsI needle crystals are grown (accumulated) by deposition in a predetermined area on the surface of the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed at a thickness of 250 &mgr;m (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19D, 20</cross-reference>). At the time of this deposition, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is covered by the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is housed in a cavity portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>of a deposition holder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and only the part of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on which the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to be formed (the aforementioned predetermined area) is exposed to the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> side through an opening <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> provided in the deposition holder <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be selectively formed in a substantially predetermined area. It is conceivable that the scintillator components that pass through the opening <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, that is, one part of the CsI component, pass through the gap between the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the floor surface of the cavity portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>, thus becoming attached to the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the side wall of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; however, these components almost never reach the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the rear surface side of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If a cover plate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is disposed on the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to cover the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, attachment to this rear surface can be completely prevented, and it is therefore preferable to provide this cover plate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The CsI which forms this scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has high hygroscopicity, and if left exposed, absorbs vapor in the air and deliquesces. In order to prevent this, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is further covered by a polyparaxylylene moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (thickness: 10 &mgr;m), thereby completing the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. This moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be formed using the same making method as for the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of this embodiment, the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> covering the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> does not only cover the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but also covers the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the periphery of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the side wall parts and furthermore to the rear surface thereof. Therefore, even when scintillator components which have passed through the opening <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> become attached to the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, these scintillator components can be securely prevented from penetrateing between the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to reach the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, deterioration of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be suppressed, and the durability thereof can be improved. Moreover, peeling of the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be securely prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is disposed facing the opposite side to the radiation entrance side, and the image-sensing element, television camera and so on are disposed and used on the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side.

Here, the radiation is absorbed by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and emitted as visible light. Of the emitted visible light, the light directed toward the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side passes through the transparent protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and is thereafter reflected by the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to return to the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side. As a result, the bulk of the light emitted from the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> passes through the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is radiated in the direction of arrow B. In the image-sensing element or television camera (not shown), this optical image is captured, whereby an image signal corresponding to a radiographic image can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> This protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not have to cover the entire rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; it is sufficient if the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> covers the side wall part and extends to the edges of the rear surface side, as does the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the eleventh embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. In this case, even if scintillator components become attached to the rear surface part of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is exposed during the deposition of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes adhered to the side wall of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that penetrating between the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes difficult. Furthermore, the scintillator components are covered and encapsulated by the moisture-resistant organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a subsequent procedure, and thus undergo no further movement, meaning that deterioration of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be suppressed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> These polyimide protective organic films <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; can be made following the making process of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>B, by applying polyimide resin over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> down to the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a constant thickness (10 &mgr;m) and causing this resin to harden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Here also, when a protective organic film is formed using polyimide resin, the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>must be formed up to the edges of the side walls and the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, and it is preferable that the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; be formed over the rear surface edges, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> are sectional views showing the thirteenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention and an example of a modification thereof. These embodiments are similar to the twelfth embodiment in that a polyimide protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is used, but differ in that the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>comprises two parts: a second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in the form of a picture frame casing which principally covers the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; and a first protective organic film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in a substantially planar form, which principally covers the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Here, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is formed over the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the peripheral edges of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, it is preferable that the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> extend to the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; however, it is acceptable for this film to extend to the edges of the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, the making method of this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>will be explained. This method is identical to the making process for the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference> up to the manufacture of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, polyimide resin is painted onto the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the proximal substrate surfaces up to the peripheral edges of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then this resin is hardened, thus forming the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in a frame shape (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>) . The second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> may also be formed by affixing resin in the form of a tape or a film rather than by painting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, polyimide resin is painted onto the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and around the periphery there of, and then caused to harden, thus forming the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in planar form to cover the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference>). Thereafter, similarly to the process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D, a</cross-reference> large number of Tl-doped CsI needle crystals are grown by deposition in a predetermined area on the surface of the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(actually, the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) . To complete the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of polyparaxylylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In forming the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in two stages in this way, the resins which are formed on the side wall sections and on the metal reflective film can be made to have different qualities and formulae, and it is thus possible to combine them such that each exhibits suitable performance. Furthermore, formation is easier when the resin is painted on than integrated formation, and the shielding ability of the resin can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A through 27D</cross-reference> are sectional views showing the fourteenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention and an example of modification thereof. In these embodiments, the order of lamination of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is made to be different from that of the thirteenth embodiment. That is, in these embodiments, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> covers the peripheral edges of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Here, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>A, it is sufficient for the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> to extend to the edges of the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but it is preferable that this film extend to the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</cross-reference>. On the other hand, it is acceptable for the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to extend to the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Next, the making method for this scintillator panel If will be explained. This method is the same as the making process of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and B</cross-reference> up to the manufacture of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, polyimide resin is painted over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the periphery of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then caused to harden, thus forming the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in planar form, covering the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, polyimide resin is painted onto the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the proximal substrate surfaces up to the peripheral edges of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and then caused to harden, thus forming the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> in a frame shape (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</cross-reference>). The second protective organic film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> may be formed by affixing resin molded into the form of a tape or film rather than by painting on the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, similarly to the process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D, a</cross-reference> large number of Tl-doped CsI needle crystals are grown by deposition in a predetermined area on the surface of the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(actually the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus forming the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</cross-reference>). To complete the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>A, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of polyparaxylylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment also, the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed in two stages, and thus the same effects as those of the thirteenth embodiment may be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a sectional constitutional diagram showing the fifteenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention. In this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on one surface of the radiolucent substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (made of a material in which the main component is glass, amorphous carbon, or another carbon). This metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a material containing one of Al, Ag, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti, Mg, or Rh. A first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed so as to envelop the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from above the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made, for example, from polyparaxylylene. A scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which converts into visible light incident radiation that has passed through the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the portion of the surface thereof on which the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are laminated. A Tl-doped CsI, for example, is used as this scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The CsI has a configuration in which a large number of needle crystals stand grouped together. A second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed in the shape of a picture frame covering an area extending from the peripheral edges of the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the edges of the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is made of polyimide, for example. This second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> adheres to the side walls of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and also adheres to the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby covering the surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the periphery of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from over the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The entire scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is substantially covered with a polyparaxylylene moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Next, the making method of this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>will be explained. First, a rectangular or circular substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (thickness: 1 mm) is prepared (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference>), and a metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on a surface thereof at a thickness of 150 nm by vacuum deposition (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Next, a protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of polyparaxylylene is formed on the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by CVD. In other words, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> deposited thereon is placed in a CVD device, wherein a moisture-proof film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed over the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 10 &mgr;m. In so doing, a polyparaxylylene protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed, covering the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and also substantially covering the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, from the periphery of the substrate reflective film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the side walls thereof, and furthermore to the rear surface thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31C</cross-reference>). The making method for this organic film is described in detail in International Publication No. WO99/66351. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Next, a large number of Tl-doped CsI needle crystals are grown by deposition in a predetermined area on the surface of the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus forming the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a thickness of 250 &mgr;m (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, polyimide tape is wound and fixed around the part extending from the peripheral edges of the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, over the exposed wall surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the exposed first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the periphery of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, up to the peripheral edges of the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thus forming the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31E</cross-reference>) . Polyimide resin which has been molded into sheet form may be used as this tape, as may tape to which an adhesive has been applied, such as Kapton Tape by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The CsI that forms the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has high hygroscopicity, and if left exposed, absorbs vapor in the air and deliquesces. In order to prevent this, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a polyparaxylylene moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (thickness: 10 <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> m), thus completing the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. This moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be formed by the same making process as the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is disposed such that the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> faces the opposite side to the radiation entrance side, and the image-sensing element, television camera and so on are disposed and used on the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side. It goes without saying that an optical system which is not illustrated may be used to lead output images from the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the image-sensing element, television camera or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Radiation enters the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>from the direction of the arrow A, passes through the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in succession, and reaches the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Here, the radiation is absorbed by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and emitted as visible light. Of the emitted visible light, the light directed toward the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side passes through the transparent protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and is thereafter reflected by the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to return to the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side. As a result, the bulk of the light emitted from the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> passes through the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is radiated in the direction of arrow B. In the image-sensing element or television camera (not shown), this optical image is captured, and thus an image signal corresponding to a radiographic image can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The side walls of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>of this embodiment are fortified by the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and hence the mechanical strength of this part can be improved. These side wall parts are not positioned on the light path of the radiation and the visible light which is converted by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and it is therefore possible to increase the thickness of the side wall parts so as to obtain the necessary strength without influencing the radiation characteristic and optical characteristic of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> part can be made with a large surface area while remaining thin, thereby enabling a combination of a large-sized screen with high resolution and a high S/N ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In order to activate the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, annealing processing, in which the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is heated following formation, is sometimes performed. In the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention, this annealing processing is possible either before or after the formation process of the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31E</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> When annealing processing is performed before the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed, there is a possibility that damage such as pin holes will occur in the exposed part of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> due to the heat during annealing processing. However, by blocking these damaged parts, scintillator components or moisture are prevented from penetrating into the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during use following manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When annealing processing is performed after the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed, the second protective organic film functions as a moisture-resistant protective film to prevent excess heat from being applied to the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during annealing processing, and hence damage to the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be suppressed. In this case, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> requires better heat resistance than the first protective organic film, and polyimide resin is suitable since it has good heat resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is not positioned on the light path of the output light from the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it is preferable that the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> be opaque with respect to the light generated by the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (preferably with 50% transmissivity or less, and more preferably 10% transmissivity or less) . When the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is made opaque in this manner, ambient light passes through the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to enter the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, where this ambient light is refracted and reflected, thereby preventing its intrusion into the output image as noise. As a result, an output image with a good S/N ratio can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> does not necessarily have to cover the area extending from the peripheral edges of the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the peripheral edges of the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and it is sufficient if the film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> covers the sidewalls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> therebetween, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. In so doing, the optical output surface may be made larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the sixteenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention. This scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>differs from that of the fifteenth embodiment in that a polyimide film is used as the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, and this film is not formed up to the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> This polyimide protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>may be manufactured following the making process of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</cross-reference> by applying polyimide resin over the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> down to the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a constant thickness (10 &mgr;m) and causing this resin to harden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is formed with heat-resistant polyimide resin, it is difficult to envelop the entire substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> therein, as with the polyparaxylylene first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment. However, in the annealing processing step to activate the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, damage to the protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the seventeenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention. The scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>of this embodiment differs from the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment in that the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed on the outside of the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other words, the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed so as to substantially cover the entire panel from the top surface to the side walls of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the surfaces of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the periphery of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and from the side walls to the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, a second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is configured in the form of a picture frame, covering the side walls of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, that is, covering the moisture-resistant protective film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the side walls of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Here, it is sufficient if the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extends to at least the edges of the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, but it is also acceptable for the film to extend to the rear surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the top surface of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Next, the method of making this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>will be explained. This method is identical to the making process for the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</cross-reference> up to the manufacture of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</cross-reference>) . Thereafter, polyimide resin is painted onto the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the surfaces of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> around the periphery of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then caused to harden, thereby forming the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in planar form, covering the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, similarly to the process in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31D, a</cross-reference> large number of Tl-doped CsI needle crystals are grown by deposition in a predetermined area on the surface of the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</cross-reference>). Then, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered by a polyparaxylylene moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34E</cross-reference>). Then, polyimide resin is painted over the moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> onto the side walls of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and all of the intermediate parts therebetween, and caused to harden, thereby forming the frame-shaped second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and completing the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>. Similarly to the fourteenth embodiment, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be formed by affixing resin molded into the form of a tape or film rather than by painting on the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, including the moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is covered by the protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and is thus supported at the side wall parts, there is no danger of damage to the moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and peeling caused by damage to the moisture-proof organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Next, one example of supporting and fixing the scintillator panel according to the present invention will be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 through 38</cross-reference> are views showing an eighteenth embodiment of the scintillator panel according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> is a front view of this scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>seen from the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> side, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is a back view seen from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> side, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</cross-reference> are sectional views on the XXXVII-XXXVII line and the XXXVIII-XXXVIII line of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> This scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>has the same basic structure as the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>of the sixteenth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, but differs therefrom in that the substrate surface and the width of the rear surface part of the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>are comparatively larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, the laminated structure of the metal reflective film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the first protective organic film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed in the central part of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, providing space on the periphery of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the four corners of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (within this area of space on the periphery), through holes <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> are provided through the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These through holes <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> are provided in the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in advance, prior to the formation of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>can be fixed by inserting and fixing bolts, screws or the like into these through holes <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Since the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>protects the subjacent substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and moisture-resistant organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, damage thereto during fixing can be suppressed. If the moisture-resistant film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> were to lie exposed, the moisture-resistant film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> would be damaged when screws and the like were inserted and tightened, allowing moisture to enter the interior through &lsqb;the damaged area&rsqb;. However, since the moisture-resistant organic film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is protected by the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, damage is unlikely to occur to the moisture-resistant organic film even when screws and the like are inserted and tightened. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is depicted in a protruding state; however, the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>maybe formed thicker than the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in order to strengthen its protecting function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> It is acceptable to form the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>so as to cover the entire rear surface of the scintillator panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>. However, in order to obtain a clearer output image, it is preferable not to form the second protective organic film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>on the radiographic image input part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, CsI (Tl) is used as the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and CsI (Na), NaI (Ti), LiI (Eu), KI (Tl), or the like may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiments, the entire surfaces of the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and substrate (the surface with the scintillator formed and a surface on the opposite side, i.e., the radiation incident surface) are covered with the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thereby making the scintillator completely resistant against water vapor. When the scintillator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and at least part of the surface of the substrate are covered with the polyparaxylylene film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the water-vapor resistance of the scintillator can be made higher than in a case wherein only the scintillator is covered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Polyparaxylylene in the above-described embodiments includes, in addition to polyparaxylylene, polymonochloroparaxylylene, polydichloroparaxylylene, polytetrachloroparaxylylene, polyfluoroparaxylylene, polydimethylparaxylylene, polydiethylparaxylylene, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> According to the scintillator panel of the present invention, any change in properties of the reflective metal thin film based on water contained in the scintillator in a small amount can be prevented, and the function of the reflective metal thin film as a reflecting film can be prevented from degrading. Hence, an increased optical output of the scintillator panel can be maintained. When a glass substrate is used, even a scintillator panel having a large area can keep its performance high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the radiation image sensor of the present invention, since the scintillator panel can maintain an increased optical output, the output of the radiation image sensor can be maintained. When a glass substrate is used, even a radiation image sensor having a large area can keep its performance high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the invention may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
