<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention belongs to the field of organometallic chemistry. In particular, this invention relates to certain novel supported organometallic solid procatalysts and catalyst systems particularly useful for olefin polymerization or interpolymerization. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A particularly useful polymerization medium for producing polyethylene polymers is a gas phase process. Examples of such are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,709,853; 4,003,712; 4,011,382; 4,302,566; 4,543,399; 4,882,400, 5,352,749 and 5,541,270 and Canadian Patent No. 991,798 and Belgian Patent No. 839,380. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems for the polymerization of olefins are well known in the art and have been known at least since the issuance of U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,115. Thereafter, many patents have been issued relating to new or improved Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. Examples of such patents are U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,594,330; 3,676,415; 3,644,318; 3,917,575; 4,105,847; 4,148,754; 4,256,866; 4,298,713; 4,311,752; 4,363,904; 4,481,301 and Reissue 33,683. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These patents disclose Ziegler-Natta type catalysts (referred to herein as ZNCs) that are well known as typically consisting of a catalyst system comprising a transition metal-containing procatalyst, which typically contains titanium, and an organometallic cocatalyst, typically an organoaluminum compound. Optionally used with the catalyst are activators such as halogenated hydrocarbons and activity modifiers such as electron donors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the earliest patents involving &lsquo;Ziegler-Natta&rsquo; catalysts for olefin polymerization, titanium halides are treated with metal alkyls in order to provide a reduced solid, consisting primarily of TiCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and typically admixed with the by-products of the reaction. In these systems, a solid which is primarily TiCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is formed which is used as the procatalyst for the polymerization of olefins. There are several families of patents describing the generation of solid TiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Soluble Ziegler-Natta catalysts have also been described. U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,297 describes a process in which an ether adduct of TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is treated with a reducing agent to afford a soluble TiCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>species, suggesting further that a precipitate forms in the absence of the ether. U.S. Pat. No. 3,862,257 describes hydrocarbon solutions of TiRCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>.AlCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>from which AlCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is removed by addition of a modifier, in order to provide low molecular weight waxes in a solution process. U.S. Pat. No. 4,319,010 describes a solution process for olefin polymerization above 110&deg; C. using a soluble catalyst formulation comprising reacting a titanium (IV) compound with the reaction product of a magnesium compound solubilized by an aluminum alkyl, while U.S. Pat. No. 4,540,756 demonstrates the activity of the reaction product of an alkylaluminum activator with a tetravalent transition metal salt solubilized by a magnesium carboxylate, specifically referring to TiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,997 describes an ethylene dimerization catalyst formed from the reaction of Ti(OR)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus;AIR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&plus;MgR<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>which has activity of less than 10 Kg/g Ti.h. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,039,766 and 5,134,104 describe soluble titanium amido catalysts which are reacted with an aluminum alkyl activator or alumoxane in the presence of the substrate olefin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Several patents describe supporting otherwise soluble catalysts. U.S. Pat. No. 3,634,384 describes generation of soluble titanium halide/aluminum alkyl species at low temperatures to which is added a hydroxylated solid support which forms Mg&mdash;O&mdash;Ti covalent bonds. U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,812 describes a similar procedure by generating a reduced titanium species in an arene solvent and adding a magnesium halide support to increase activity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,126 describes a hydrocarbon soluble reaction product obtained by reacting an alkoxide-containing transition metal compound with an organometallic compound which is useful in the preparation of catalysts for polymerizing olefins. A variation of this is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,994 wherein a titanium alkoxide is reacted with an aluminum alkyl, followed by addition of a magnesium compound which forms MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>under the reaction conditions. This case further specifies the importance of an &agr;, &ohgr;-dihaloalkane in preventing over-reduction to TiCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,725 teaches the reaction of TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>with various supports, e.g. silicon carbide, followed by treatment AlEt<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl as a cocatalyst. The supported catalyst shows an improvement of less than a factor of two over the unsupported precipitated catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,315 describes generation of a similar supported catalyst in which the titanium and aluminum compounds are added simultaneously to a slurry of a carrier, with any reaction occurring only in the presence of said carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Certain soluble or &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems are known which utilize titanium chelates. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,737,416 and 3,737,417 describe the reaction of titanium chelates with halogenating agents followed by activation with aluminum alkyls to provide catalysts which copolymerize &agr;-olefins and butadiene. These activations are carried out at temperatures as low as &minus;78&deg; C. in the presence of monomer. U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,705 claims only the use of nitrile electron donors reacted with TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>prior to treatment with organoaluminum compounds These catalysts are used preferably in arene solution or slurry. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,482,639, 4,603,185, and 4,727,123 describe bimetallic complexes with monoanionic tridentate chelating ligands which are activated with aluminum alkyls for the polymerization of olefins, alkynes, and dienes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,595 describes catalysts based on soluble trivalent metal (especially vanadium) complexes of bidentate chelating ligands. These soluble complexes are prepared by reaction of the trivalent metal halide with compounds containing acidic hydrogen, and are activated for the polymerization of olefins with aluminum alkyls. U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,778 reports the reaction of titanium amides with organic oxygen-containing compounds having acidic hydrogens, followed by in-situ activation with aluminum alkyls to give highly active, unsupported olefin polymerization catalysts. U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,646 reports Ti, Zr, or Hf dialkyl complexes of chelating bis(alkoxide) ligands with a tethered Lewis base attached to the ligand backbone. These compounds may be used for the polymerization of olefins in the presence of an activator which generates a cationic complex, such as trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate or methyl alumoxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Aluminum alkyls are commonly used as activators or cocatalysts with Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and there are some examples of compounds of the form AlR<highlight><subscript>3-n</subscript></highlight>L<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>(n&equals;1 or 2), where each L is a monoanionic ligand. U.S. Pat. No. 3,489,736 illustrates the use of various aluminum nitrogen compounds, including carboxylic acid amides, as cocatalysts in conjunction with an aluminum halide as Lewis acid with Ziegler-Natta catalysts such as TiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 3,723,348 describes use of vanadium compounds with an activator which may be an aluminum alkoxide, amide, carboxylate, or acetylacetonate, among others. U.S. Pat. No. 3,786,032 utilizes the reaction product of an organoaluminum or organozinc with an oxime or hydroxyester as activators. U.S. Pat. No. 3,883,493 utilizes aluminum carbamates in conjunction with another organoaluminum compound as cocatalysts. Conjugated dienes may be polymerized using mixed titanium or vanadium halides, an aluminum trialkyl and a small amount of carbon disulfide, as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 3,948,869. U.S. Pat. No. 4,129,702 discloses use of aluminum or zinc salts of carboxylic acid amides as activators with Ziegler-Natta catalysts, optionally on a support, for the polymerization of vinyl or vinylidene halides, noting the improvement of aging the co-catalyst to eliminate isocyanate. U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,707 describes use of bidentate, dianionic Group 13 element compounds as co-catalysts. U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,641 also describes use of aluminum catecholate compounds as a components in a four-component catalyst system which includes organocyclic compounds with two or more conjugated double bonds </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Aluminum chelates have also been used as external donors. U.S. Pat. No. 3,313,791 discloses use of acetylacetonato aluminum alkoxides as external donors with a titanium trichloride and alkyl aluminum dihalide catalyst system. U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,180 discusses the use of external donors which may be bidentate in combination either with the titanium catalyst or the aluminum co-catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,120 describes the use of cationic aluminum amidinate compounds as single site catalysts for the polymerization of olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,534,006 describes a catalyst comprising Groups 4-6 metal compounds activated with bis(dialkylaluminoxy)alkane compounds. It further claims the use of additional external donors or promoters which include a wide variety of nitrogen-containing compounds. U.S. Pat. No. 4,195,069 describes the interaction of a TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>complex with a complexing agent with an organoaluminum complex with a complexing agent. This interaction results in reduction of TiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to a precipitate of TiCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The polymerization or interpolymerization process of the present invention may be carried out using any conventional process. For example, there may be utilized polymerization or interpolymerization in suspension, in solution, in super-critical fluid or in gas phase media. All of these polymerization or interpolymerization processes are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A particularly desirable method for producing polyethylene polymers and interpolymers according to the present invention is a gas phase polymerization process preferably utilizing a fluidized bed reactor. This type reactor and means for operating the reactor are well known and completely described in U.S Patents Nos. 3,709,853; 4,003,712; 4,011,382; 4,012,573; 4,302,566; 4,543,399; 4,882,400; 5,352,749; 5,541,270; Canadian Patent No. 991,798 and Belgian Patent No. 839,380. These patents disclose gas phase polymerization processes wherein the polymerization medium is either mechanically agitated or fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In general, the polymerization process of the present invention may be effected as a continuous gas phase process such as a fluid bed process. A fluid bed reactor for use in the process of the present invention typically comprises a reaction zone and a so-called velocity reduction zone. The reaction zone comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent to remove heat of polymerization through the reaction zone. Optionally, some of the recirculated gases may be cooled and compressed to form liquids that increase the heat removal capacity of the circulating gas stream when readmitted to the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by simple experiment. Make up of gaseous monomer to the circulating gas stream is at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product and monomer associated therewith is withdrawn from the reactor and the composition of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. The gas leaving the reaction zone is passed to the velocity reduction zone where entrained particles are removed. Finer entrained particles and dust may be removed in a cyclone and/or fine filter. The gas is passed through a heat exchanger wherein the heat of polymerization is removed, compressed in a compressor and then returned to the reaction zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the reactor temperature of the fluid bed process herein ranges from about 30&deg; C. to about 110&deg; C. In general, the reactor temperature is operated at the highest temperature that is feasible taking into account the sintering temperature of the polymer product within the reactor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention is suitable for the production of polymers of olefins and/or interpolymers of olefins and at least one or more other olefins. Preferably, the process of the present invention is suitable for the production of polymers of ethylene and/or interpolymers of ethylene and at least one or more other olefins. Preferably the olefins are alpha-olefins. The olefins, for example, may contain from 2 to 16 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred for preparation herein by the process of the present invention are linear polyethylene polymers and interpolymers. Such linear polyethylene polymers or interpolymers are preferably linear homopolymers of ethylene and linear interpolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin wherein the ethylene content is at least about 50% by weight of the total monomers involved. Examples of alpha-olefins that may be utilized herein are propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 4-methylpent-1-ene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-hexadecene and the like. Also utilizable herein are polyenes such as 1,3-hexadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 4-vinylcyclohex-1-ene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and olefins formed in situ in the polymerization or interpolymerization medium. When olefins are formed in situ in the polymerization or interpolymerization medium, the formation of linear polyethylene polymers or interpolymers containing long chain branching may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Examples of the polymers or interpolymers that can be produced by the process of the present invention include polymers of ethylene and interpolymers of ethylene and at least one or more alpha-olefins having 3 to 16 carbon atoms wherein ethylene comprises at least about 50% by weight of the total monomers involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The olefin polymers or interpolymers of the present invention may be fabricated into films by any technique known in the art. For example, films may be produced by the well known cast film, blown film and extrusion coating techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Further, the olefin polymers or interpolymers may be fabricated into other articles of manufacture, such as molded articles, by any of the well known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the process of the invention, the solid procatalyst, cocatalyst, or catalyst system can be introduced in any manner known in the art. For example, the solid procatalyst can be introduced directly into the polymerization or interpolymerization medium in the form of a slurry or a dry free flowing powder. The solid procatalyst can also be used in the form of a prepolymer obtained by contacting the solid procatalyst with one or more olefins in the presence of a cocatalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The molecular weight of the olefin polymers or interpolymers produced by the present invention can be controlled in any known manner, for example, by using hydrogen. The molecular weight control may be evidenced by an increase in the melt index (I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of the polymer or interpolymer when the molar ratio of hydrogen to ethylene in the polymerization or interpolymerization medium is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples. There are, of course, many other forms of this invention which will become obvious to one skilled in the art, once the invention has been fully disclosed, and it will accordingly be recognized that these examples are given for the purpose of illustration only, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention in any way. </paragraph>
