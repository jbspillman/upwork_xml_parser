<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an air-conditioning system that can be operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for a vehicle. The system has a high-pressure section that is connected to the pressure output of a compressor and includes a gas cooler and a first branch of an internal heat exchanger, a low-pressure section that is connected to the suction inlet of the compressor and includes an evaporator, an accumulator and a second branch of the internal heat exchanger, and an expansion member connecting the high-pressure section to the low-pressure section, with optimum performance figures being assigned to optimum high pressures in the high-pressure section. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In air-conditioning systems and, of course, also in air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the cooling performance to be supplied depends on the ambient temperature. The aim in practice is to operate with the most optimum performance figures possible, that is to say the ratio of the cooling performance to the drive power. It is known that the respectively optimum performance figures are in each case assigned to an optimum high pressure, that is to say are achieved at a high pressure that is optimum for the optimum performance figure. It has therefore become known to control the respectively optimum high pressures by means of a controllable expansion valve. The aim here is to move to the optimum high pressures for the respectively optimum performance figures as accurately as possible. This requires a high cost outlay in relation to the adjustable expansion valve, in relation to the high-pressure sensors needed and in relation to the design of the control system overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The increased complexity of air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for the additional internal heat exchanger and for the high-pressure regulation by means of an expansion valve, which are not necessary in the case of air-conditioning systems operated with other refrigerants, leads to the air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>being made considerably more expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a refrigerant is significantly more environmentally friendly than other refrigerants and also offers other advantages, and although the performance of air-conditioning systems operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is at least equivalent, even if not superior to, the performance of air-conditioning systems operated with other refrigerants, the higher price places practical use at risk. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based on the object of providing an air-conditioning system that can be operated with CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the type described above which permits a simplified construction and therefore a price reduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by the individual components being designed and/or matched to one another in such a way that if the high pressures deviate by up to &plusmn;30% from the optimum high pressures, the associated optimum performance figures are reduced by no more than 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Trials have shown that it is possible to design an air-conditioning system in this way, so that a satisfactory cooling performance with a satisfactory performance figure is achieved, without complicated high-pressure regulation being necessary. It is then possible to provide significantly simplified regulation of the high pressure which, for example, operates with larger graduations. Under certain circumstances, it is even possible to manage with a single fixed throttle, that is to say to dispense completely with regulation of the high pressure.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The air-conditioning system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a controllable compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that has an isentropic efficiency of at least 0.6 and a volumetric efficiency of likewise at least 0.6. The regulation of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be carried out by switching it on and off, by means of internal adjustment or by adjusting the stroke. The high-pressure outlet of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to a high-pressure section, in which there is a gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The gas cooler <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also arranged in the high-pressure section is a branch of an internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. From the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.4, the CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which is under high pressure, passes to an expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which expands the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from high pressures up to about 12 MPa or even 14 MPa to pressures of 3.5 MPa to 5.0 MPa. The expanded CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>then flows into a low-pressure section to an evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, through an accumulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and then through a second branch of the internal heat exchanger <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to the suction connector of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a thermal efficacy of at least 0.7. The accumulator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a volume of more than 40 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The lines or hoses of the high-pressure section have a diameter of about 2 mm to 8 mm. The lines or hoses of the low-pressure section have a somewhat larger diameter, which can be from 3 mm to 10 mm. The refrigerant content of the entire air-conditioning system is less than 600 g of CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Associated with the air-conditioning system is a control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, into which the signals from a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are input, which is assigned to the evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the outlet side of the cooled air. Also provided is a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which registers the suction pressure of the compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and inputs it into the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In addition, the desired cooling of the air flowing through the evaporator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the temperature of the external environment are input into the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The compressor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is regulated on the basis of these values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The individual components of the air-conditioning system are designed and matched to one another in such a way that if the high pressure deviates from the optimum high pressure, the performance figures change in accordance with the curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, that is to say they remain in a relatively narrow bandwidth. The value of the optimum high pressure (P<highlight><subscript>opt</subscript></highlight>) divided by the value of the actual high pressure (P) expressed as a percentage is plotted on the X-axis while the actual performance figure (COP) divided by the optimum or maximum performance figure (COP<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>) expressed as a percentage is plotted on the Y-axis. In the event of deviations in the high pressures of up to &plusmn;30% from the optimum high pressure (P<highlight><subscript>opt</subscript></highlight>) associated with the optimum or maximum performance figure (COP<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>), the performance figure COP is reduced by no more than 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It must not necessarily be expected that the curve of the performance figure COP against the high pressure P corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and having only a low bandwidth of deviations will result in this or a similar way if the specified minimum values are implemented for the functions of all the components in the air-conditioning system. Instead, by means of trials it is necessary to determine whether for one or more components, higher values than the minimum values have to be implemented, if appropriate, in order to match the components to one another and to design the air-conditioning system in such a way that the deviations of the performance figure COP from the maximum or optimum performance figure COP<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>remain within the desired bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If an air-conditioning system is designed in such a way that the dependence of the performance figure COP on the pressure P lies in a range similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is then possible to design the expansion member <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a fixed throttle, that is to dispense completely with high-pressure regulation. In this case, a fixed throttle whose throttle opening is such that the high pressure is limited to a maximum of 14 MPa or, if appropriate, even to lower values, for example 12 MPa, is sufficient. However, provision can also be made for a number of fixed throttles or expansion members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; to be connected in parallel, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The fixed throttles can alternatively be brought into use individually or, if appropriate, also jointly and, in so doing, in each case limit the high pressure to a specific high-pressure range. The activation of these fixed throttles is then carried out by the controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for example on the basis of the high pressure or suction pressure and/or the temperature of the environment. It is likewise possible to provide a simplified expansion valve, whose throttle opening can be varied only in stages, for example. In this case, only a suitable high-pressure range would be selected, without providing true regulation of the high pressure. In this way, a reduction in the manufacturing costs can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Overall, the invention makes it possible to simplify, at least significantly, the complicated high-pressure regulation, previously held to be necessary by those skilled in the art, by means of a controllable expansion valve and a high-pressure sensor, or even to dispense entirely with this regulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the present invention has been described in what is considered to represent its preferred embodiment. However, it should be noted that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described without departing from its spirit or scope. </paragraph>
