<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> show sequential steps in fabricating a self-grounding connector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A according to a first embodiment of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>A. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in a first step a sheeting <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of a non-sticking material and covering a slowly rotating, generally circular mandrel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is evenly coated using a fiberglass applicator roller <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with a thin layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a liquid admixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a settable chemically resistant resin, either halogenated or unhalogenated, and a curing agent therefor. Preferably these are, respectively, an epoxy vinyl ester impregnating resin and benzoyl peroxide. Preferably, the sheeting is a polyester film such as MYLAR&reg;. Other materials which can be used include: (a) fluoropolymer films such as HALAR&reg; ethylene trichlorofluoroethylene copolymer and KYNAR&reg; (poly)vinylidene fluoride; (b) polyolefin films such as polypropylene film; (c) other polyester films; and (d) metallic foils such as wax coated aluminum foil. Alternatively, a cardboard tube is interposed between the mandrel and sheeting to further facilitate removal of the finished cylindrical product from the mandrel. Layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has an interior surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>S contiguous to the sheeting <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an exterior surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>E. Layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is 2 to 3 mils in thickness and is dispensed from a suitable dispensing device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The benzoyl peroxide, which is 1 to 5 percent-by-weight relative to the weight of the resin, cures the liquid resin to a solid at ambient temperature. About 0.3 pound of resin per square foot of mandrel surface area is used. Preferably, the resin is type 510A-40 DERAKANE&reg; manufactured by the Dow Chemical Company of Channahon, Ill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Mandrel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is clamped generally horizontally between a rotating chuck and a tailstock spindle of a filament winding machine, and rotates at a selectable constant rate. As detailed in the &apos;333 published application, a two-axis machine is used to apply a matrix of carbon fibers and resin under controlled tension to the mandrel in a predetermined geometrical pattern. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in a second step a plurality of continuous carbon fiber-filament ribbons is helically wound onto the mandrel after passage through a bath <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> containing the admixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment eight ribbons, each about 0.250-inch in width and about 0.010-inch in thickness, after unwinding from contiguous spools S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and exiting bath <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, are aligned edge-to-edge by a payout eye <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to form a two-inch wide band <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The band is wound helically onto surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>E at an angle of about 72&deg; with respect to the mandrel&apos;s longitudinal axis to form a diamond-shaped pattern. As the eye moves back and forth along the mandrel, interstices in the pattern are filled in to form a single continuous ribbon-layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). Ribbon-layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is embedded in admixture layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that interior surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>S is integrated with a smooth continuous surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>S (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) of resin-impregnated carbon fiber-filaments which preferably is about 63 percent carbon and 37 percent admixture, by weight, within a feasible range of about 50 to 70 percent carbon and about 30 to 50 percent admixture. Typically, the thickness of ribbon-layer 40 is about 25 mils, but can be between 15 and 35 mils. Alternatively, a lesser or greater number of ribbons may be used to provide a narrower or wider bandwidth. Preferably, the ribbon used is PANEX&reg; 33-48K continuous carbon fiber which has a filament count of 45,700 and a yield of 450 ft/lb, manufactured from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor by Zoltek Corporation of St. Louis, Mo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, in a third step ribbon-layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is evenly coated with a thin layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of admixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a fiberglass &ldquo;deairing&rdquo; roller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is used to roll out air trapped in the ribbon-layer. Layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> typically is 2-3 mils in thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, in a fourth step a layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of surfacing veil having an outer surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>S, about 10 mils in thickness and wetted out with the admixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is helically wound over layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Typically, the veil width is about 4 inches. Preferably, glass &ldquo;C&rdquo;-veil is used. C-veil is glass fiber tissue of randomly dispersed glass fibers bonded into a sheet by a polyester resin. The fibers are produced from &ldquo;C&rdquo; glass, a chemically resistant glass highly resistant to attack by both acid and alkaline environments.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Volume and surface resistivity tests according to ASTM D 4496-87 were performed on specimens cut from a connector having fabricated according to the first process embodiment of the present invention. The connector was approximately 6 -inches in diameter by 3.5-inches wide by 0.070-inch thick. The tests were performed by Delsen Testing Laboratories, Inc. of Glendale, Calif. Five specimens, each approximately 3.5-inches by 1-inch, were cut out from the axial direction of the connector. The specimens were cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and distilled water and dried at room ambient conditions. A four-point measurement technique was used to determine the resistance of the specimens. Two ends of each specimen were painted with conductive silver paint and served as current electrodes. Two conductive silver paint lines were applied across the width of the inner surface of each specimen and served as potential electrodes. While DC current was applied to the specimen through the two outer electrodes, the potential drop between the two inner electrodes was measured. </paragraph>
