<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An intraocular lens including an optic portion having an outer peripheral edge and two, three or four balanced looped haptic elements for use to achieve refractive correction. Each looped haptic is formed to have greater resistance to bending in a plane generally parallel to an eye&apos;s optical axis than in a plane generally perpendicular to the eye&apos;s optical axis. The intraocular lens is designed with specific flexibility characteristics so as to exhibit less than approximately 1.0 mm axial displacement of the optic portion along the eye&apos;s optical axis under a compression force suitable to effect a 1.0 mm in diameter compression of the intraocular lens. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to intraocular lenses (IOLs) and a method for making and using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to IOLs designed primarily for refractive correction in phakic eyes where the eye&apos;s natural lens remains intact. IOLs made in accordance with the present invention may also be used in aphakic eyes where a diseased natural lens is surgically removed, such as in the case of cataracts. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Visual acuity deficiencies such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and presbyopia (age-related farsightedness) are typically corrected with use of refractive lenses such as spectacles or contact lenses. Although these types of lenses are effective in correcting a wearer&apos;s eyesight, many wearers consider the lenses inconvenient. The lenses must be located, worn at certain times, removed periodically and may be lost or misplaced. The lenses may also be dangerous or cumbersome if the wearer participates in athletic activities or suffers an impact in an area near the eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of surgically implanted IOLs as a permanent form of refractive correction in phakic eyes has been gaining in popularity. IOL implants have been used for many years in aphakic eyes as replacements for diseased natural crystalline lenses that have been surgically removed from the eyes. Many different IOL designs have been developed over past years and proven successful for use in aphakic eyes. Successful IOL designs to date primarily include an optic portion with supports therefor, called haptics, connected to and surrounding at least part of the optic portion. The haptic portions of an IOL are designed to support the optic portion of the IOL in the lens capsule, anterior chamber or posterior chamber of an eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Commercially successful IOLs have been made from a variety of biocompatible materials, ranging from more rigid materials such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) to softer, more flexible materials capable of being folded or compressed such as silicones, certain acrylics, and hydrogels. Haptic portions of the IOLs have been formed separately from the optic portion and later connected thereto through processes such as heat, physical staking and/or chemical bonding. Haptics have also been formed as an integral part of the optic portion in what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;single-piece&rdquo; IOLs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Softer, more flexible IOLs have gained in popularity in more recent years due to their ability to be compressed, folded, rolled or otherwise deformed. Such softer IOLs may be deformed prior to insertion thereof through an incision in the cornea of an eye. Following insertion of the IOL in an eye, the IOL returns to its original pre-deformed shape due to the memory characteristics of the soft material. Softer, more flexible IOLs as just described may be implanted into an eye through an incision that is much smaller, i.e., 2.8 to 3.2 mm, than that necessary for more rigid IOLs, i.e., 4.8 to 6.0 mm. A larger incision is necessary for more rigid IOLs because the lens must be inserted through an incision in the cornea slightly larger than the diameter of the inflexible IOL optic portion. Accordingly, more rigid IOLs have become less popular in the market since larger incisions have been found to be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative complications, such as induced astigmatism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After IOL implantation, both softer and more rigid IOLs are subject to compressive forces exerted on the outer edges thereof, which typically occur when an individual squints or rubs the eye. These compressive forces may result in decentration of the IOL and distortion of the visual image. Compressive forces exerted on an IOL also tend to cause axial displacement of the IOL along the optical axis of an eye. Movement of an IOL along the optical axis of an eye has the potential in anterior chamber applications to cause the IOL to contact and damage the delicate corneal endothelial cell layer of the eye. Such potential damage to the delicate corneal endothelial cell layer is due in part to the design of anterior chamber IOLs that are vaulted to prevent interference or damage to the iris of an eye. Also, IOLs of current designs, whether vaulted or unvaulted, or formed of either softer or more rigid materials, tend to deflect along the optical axis of an eye when the haptics are compressed. IOL manufacturers provide a wide range of IOL sizes to more precisely fit IOLs to each particular patient&apos;s eye size. Providing a wide range of IOL sizes is an attempt to minimize the potential for axial displacement of the IOL along the optical axis of an eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because of the noted shortcomings of current IOL designs, there is a need for IOLs designed to minimize axial displacement of the IOL optic portion along the optical axis of the eye when compressive forces are exerted against the outer edges thereof. By lessening an IOLs movement along the optical axis of an eye, more certain refractive correction may be achieved and the risk of corneal endothelial cell layer damage may be reduced. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An intraocular lens (IOL) made in accordance with the present invention has an optic portion with an outer peripheral edge and two, three or four looped haptic elements for supporting the optic portion in a patient&apos;s eye. A lens having two looped haptic elements is balanced by having a looped haptic element formed or attached on two opposed edges of the optic portion. A lens having three looped haptic elements is balanced by having a set of two looped haptic elements formed or attached on one edge of the optic and the third looped haptic element formed or attached on an opposite edge of the optic. A lens having four looped haptic elements is balanced by having a set of two looped haptic elements formed or attached on one edge of the optic and a set of two looped haptic elements formed or attached on an opposite edge of the optic. Each looped haptic element has an inner edge portion, an outer edge portion and generally two attachment portions that permanently connect the looped haptic elements to the outer peripheral edge of the optic portion. In the case of lenses having three or four looped-haptic elements, a set of two looped haptic elements may have three attachment portions rather than four. In such a case, one of the three attachment portions is common to each of the two looped haptic elements in the set. Each looped haptic element also includes a flexible central portion located adjacent to each of the two attachment portions and a contact plate located between the two flexible central portions. The contact plate is designed to engage an inner surface of a patient&apos;s eye. The two flexible central portions that extend between the contact plate and the attachment portions allow the lens to adjust to pressures exerted on the lens within the eye. Additionally, within these flexible central portions, each looped haptic element is designed to have greater resistance to bending in a plane generally parallel to the optical axis of an eye than in a plane generally perpendicular to the optical axis of an eye. By providing looped haptic elements with this type of flexibility characteristic, the present IOL fits eyes of varying sizes. The flexibility characteristic of the subject looped haptic elements relative to the optic portion also eliminates unacceptable axial displacement of the optic portion along the optical axis when compressive forces are exerted against the looped haptic elements of the IOL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide intraocular lenses for use in phakic eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide intraocular lenses for use in phakic eyes, which fit a variety of eye sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide intraocular lenses for use in phakic eyes, which minimize axial displacement of the optic portions of-the lenses along the optical axis of the eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide intraocular lenses for use in phakic eyes, which minimize damage to tissues in the interior of the eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide intraocular lenses, which are resistant to decentration within the eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and other objectives and advantages of the present invention, some of which are specifically described and others that are not, will become apparent from the detailed description, drawings and claims that follow, wherein like features are designated by like numerals.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a simplified diagram of an eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> showing landmark structures relevant to the implantation of an intraocular lens of the present invention. Eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an optically dear cornea <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A natural crystalline lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a retina <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are located behind the iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located in front of iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> located between iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and natural lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. IOLs of the present invention are preferably implanted in anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to correct refractive errors while healthy natural lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> remains in place (phakic application). IOLs of the present invention may also be implanted in posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or lens capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for use in aphakic eyes. When used in aphakic eyes, IOLs serve as replacements for surgically removed diseased natural lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as for example following cataract surgeries. Eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes an optical axis OA-OA that is an imaginary line that passes through the optical center <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of anterior surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and posterior surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Optical axis OA-OA in the human eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally perpendicular to a portion of cornea <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, natural lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and retina <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The IOL of the present invention, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 14</cross-reference> but best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is identified generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with an outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is designed for implantation preferably in anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a patient&apos;s eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is preferably vaulted. For anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> applications, a vault of approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mm but preferably 1.6 to 1.7 mm measuring from the plane of outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the plane of contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, described in detail below, is generally suitable. However as mentioned above, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may likewise be implanted in posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or in the case of an aphakic eye, in lens capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in which case IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> need not be vaulted. Preferably integrally formed on peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are two, three or four looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, each having an inner edge portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an outer edge portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are preferably integrally formed with and permanently connected to outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by attachment portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Alternatively however, haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be attached to optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by staking, chemical polymerization or other methods known to those skilled in the art. Each looped haptic element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also includes a broadened contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> designed to preferably engage inner surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. However, contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is also suitable to engage inner surfaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or inner surfaces <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in lens capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are designed so that when IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is implanted in a patient&apos;s eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and held in place through compressive forces exerted by inner surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> flex so that contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> do not slide along surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are designed to flex in a plane generally parallel to that of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and generally perpendicular to that of optical axis OA-OA of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By designing this type of flexibility characteristic into looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be manufactured in one or a few standard sizes and be a suitable fit for most sizes of patients&apos; eyes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The flexibility characteristic of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also minimizes axial displacement of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a direction along optical axis OA-OA of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Compressive forces of differing magnitudes within the range of approximately 0.1 to 5 mN exerted against contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to effect approximately an overall 1.0 mm in diameter compression of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such as that caused by differing eye sizes, results in less than approximately 1.0 mm, but more preferably less than approximately 0.5 mm and most preferably less than approximately 0.3 mm axial displacement of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> along optical axis OA-OA in an eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Under like compressive forces, IOLs known in the art result in greater than 1.0 mm axial displacement of the optic portion along the optical axis in the eye, which may damage delicate tissues therein. The unique design of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> achieves significantly minimized axial displacement of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the present invention with its minimized axial displacement of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> protects the corneal endothelium cell layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from damage when a wide range of compressive forces, potentially even greater than those described above, are applied to eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The flexibility characteristic of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as described above is achieved through the unique design thereof. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and most particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed with angled, arched or bowed flexible central portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> adjacent to attachment portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> permanently connected to outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The angled, arched or bowed flexible central portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are essential in imparting the necessary flexibility to the IOLs of the present invention. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 10</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, flexible central portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> have a dimension in plane <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, generally parallel to optical axis OA-OA, equal to or greater than the same in plane <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> generally perpendicular to optical axis OA-OA as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Transition portions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, of significantly decreasing size in dimension in plane <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extend from flexible central portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to broadened contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is relatively flat with either rounded edges <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to provide a smoother fit with inner surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, or more defined, sharper edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to provide a barrier to prevent cellular migration and growth upon implantation in lens capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The relatively thin or flat contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also minimizes iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contact by virtue of its overall angled, arched or bowed cross section as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably manufactured to have an optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> approximately 4.5 to 9.0 mm, but preferably approximately 5.0 to 6.0 mm and most preferably 5.5 mm in diameter and approximately 0.15 mm to 1.0 mm, but preferably approximately 0.6 to 0.8 mm and most preferably 0.7 mm in thickness at peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extend from the optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a generally rounded or oval configuration and will increase or decrease in overall length depending upon the size of lens desired and the diameter of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As the diameter of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> increases, the overall length of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be decreased. Likewise, as the diameter of optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> decreases, the overall length of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be increased. However, as customary, the overall length of the looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are varied to achieve desired IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> sizes rather than varying the sizes of optic portions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In general, looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed to be approximately 2.6 to 6.0 mm, but preferably approximately 3.4 to 5.0 mm and most preferably approximately 4.2 mm in length measuring from a point of equal distance between common attachment portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to the center of contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are preferred to have a generally rounded or oval configuration as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to allow radial deflection under compressive forces. For purposes of the present invention, the generally rounded or oval shape of looped haptic element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, i.e., the beam curve shape, relative to the width to thickness ratio, i.e., the aspect ratio, of looped haptic element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as described herein is critical to achieve suitable function. Flexible central portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of looped haptic element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.5 to 2.5 mm, but preferably approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mm and most preferably 1.6 mm in length; approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mm, but preferably approximately 0.3 to 0.7 mm and most preferably approximately 0.46 mm in thickness in plane <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and approximately 0.2 to 0.7 mm, but preferably approximately 0.3 to 0.6 and most preferably approximately 0.43 mm in width in plane <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Transition portions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are approximately 0.4 to 1.1 mm, but preferably approximately 0.5 to 1.0 mm and most preferably approximately 0.8 mm in length. Contact plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.8 to 2.5 mm, but preferably approximately 1.0 to 2.2 mm and most preferably approximately 1.8 mm in length, approximately 0.05 to 0.5 mm, but preferably approximately 0.1 to 0.4 mm and most preferably approximately 0.3 mm in thickness and approximately 0.6 to 1.5 mm, but preferably approximately 0.8 to 1.2 mm and most preferably approximately 1.0 mm in width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As provided through the dimensions of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> above, looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> gradually change from being relatively thin in plane <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at outer edge portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to being relatively thick at attachment portions <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, with flexible central portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably exhibiting a thicker dimension in plane <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> than that of the width in plane <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the subject design tend to deflect into closer proximity with outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when a compression force is exerted against contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with minimal axial displacement along optical axis OA-OA. When IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is used as a refractive lens, a stable, reliable refractive correction is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The desired flexibility characteristic of looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may likewise be achieved or enhanced by incorporating a stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, in the shape of a ribbon, in one or more looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be positioned in looped haptic element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that flat face <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is oriented parallel to the dimension <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> functions in a manner similar to that of an I-beam in construction to prevent axial displacement along optical axis OA-OA when compressive force is applied to contact plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed of a less flexible material than that of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Suitable materials for stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> include but are not limited to polyimides, polyolefins, high-density polyethylenes, polyesters, nylons, metals or any biocompatible material with suitable stiffening characteristics. Stiffening element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used in conjunction with looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described above or in cases where a thinner haptic design is desired while still achieving the desired flexibility characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Suitable materials for the production of the subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> include but are not limited to foldable or compressible materials, such as silicone polymers, hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon polymers, hydrogels, soft acrylic polymers, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethane, silicone polymers with hydrophilic monomer units, fluorine-containing polysiloxane elastomers and combinations thereof. The preferred material for the production of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the present invention is a hydrogel made from 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 6-hydroxyhexyl methacrylate (HOHEXMA), i.e., poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA). Poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA) is the preferred material for the manufacture of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> due to its equilibrium water content of approximately 18 percent by weight, and high refractive index of approximately 1.474, which is greater than that of the aqueous humor of the eye, i.e., 1.33. A high refractive index is a desirable feature in the production of IOLs to impart high optical power with a minimum of optic thickness. By using a material with a high refractive index, visual acuity deficiencies may be corrected using a thinner IOL. A thin IOL, such as that of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, is particularly desirable in phakic applications to minimize potentially harmful contact between IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and iris <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and corneal endothelium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA) is also a desirable material in the production of IOLs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> due to its mechanical strength, which is suitable to withstand considerable physical manipulation. Poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA) also has desirable memory properties suitable for IOL use. IOLs manufactured from a material possessing good memory properties such as those of poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA) unfold in a more controlled manner in an eye, rather than explosively, to its predetermined shape. The unique design of the subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> manufactured from a material having good memory properties also provides improved control of haptic unfolding upon insertion thereof in eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Explosive unfolding of IOLs is undesirable due to potential damage to delicate tissues within the eye. Poly(HEMA-co-HOHEXMA) also has dimensional stability in the eye, which is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Although the teachings of the present invention are preferably applied to soft or foldable IOLs formed of a foldable or compressible material, the same may also be applied to harder, less flexible lenses formed of a relatively rigid material such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) having flexible haptics formed either of the same or a different material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be a positive powered lens from 0 to approximately &plus;40 diopters or a negative powered lens from 0 to approximately &minus;30 diopters. Optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be biconvex, plano-convex, plano-concave, biconcave or concave-convex (meniscus), depending upon the power required to achieve the appropriate central and peripheral thickness for efficient handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may optionally be formed with a glare reduction zone <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.25 to 2.00 mm but more preferably approximately 0.3 to 0.6 mm and most preferably 0.5 mm in width adjacent outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for reducing glare when outer peripheral edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is struck by light entering eye<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during high light or at other times when pupil <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is dilated. Glare reduction zone <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is typically fabricated of the same material as optic portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, but may be opaque, colored or patterned in a conventional manner to block or diffuse light in plane with optical axis OA-OA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be molded or preferably manufactured by first producing discs from a material of choice as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,217,491 and 5,326,506 each incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. If discs are produced, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then be machined from the material discs in a conventional manner. Once machined or molded, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be polished, cleaned, sterilized and packaged by a conventional method known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is used in eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by creating an incision in cornea <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, inserting IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in either anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and closing the incision. Alternatively, IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be used in eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by creating an incision in cornea <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, removing natural lens <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, inserting IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and closing the incision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides for a refractive lens suitable for use in lens capsule <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or posterior chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but most preferably for use in anterior chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has looped haptic elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with flexibility characteristics that minimize axial displacement along optical axis OA-OA of eye <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereby preventing decentration of IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, distortion of vision and damage to corneal endothelium <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, having the flexibility characteristics described herein, is also commercially desirable because one or a few lens sizes suitably fit eyes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of most sizes. By providing a lens suitable for use as a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; lens, such as that of the present invention, clinical risks to patients due to improperly sized lenses are minimized. Such clinical risks minimized include pupil ovalization, corneal endothelium damage and poor fixation. Likewise, manufacturers&apos; need to produce IOLs of many sizes to fit eyes of many sizes is eliminated, thus reducing production and inventory costs associated therewith. Ophthalmologists also benefit from the subject IOL <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in that time is saved by eliminating the need to determine each patient&apos;s eye size and costs associated with maintaining large inventories of varying sized lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While there is shown and described herein certain specific embodiments of the present invention, it will be manifest to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the underlying inventive concept and that the same is not limited to the particular forms herein shown and described except insofar as indicated by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
