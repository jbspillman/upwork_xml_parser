<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to deposition of a metal layer onto a wafer or other substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrochemical deposition system for forming a metal layer on a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Sub-quarter micron, multi-level metallization is one of the key technologies for the next generation of ultra large scale integration (ULSI). The multilevel interconnects that lie at the heart of this technology require planarization of interconnect features formed in high aspect ratio apertures, including contacts, vias, lines and other features. Reliable formation of these interconnect features is very important to the success of ULSI and to the continued effort to increase circuit density and quality on individual substrates and die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As circuit densities increase, the widths of vias, contacts and other features, as well as the dielectric materials between them, decrease to less than 250 nanometers, whereas the thickness of the dielectric layers remains substantially constant, with the result that the aspect ratios for the features, i.e., their height divided by width, increases. Many traditional deposition processes, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), have difficulty filling structures where the aspect ratio exceeds 4:1, and particularly where it exceeds 10:1. Therefore, there is a great amount of ongoing effort being directed at the formation of void-free, nanometer-sized features having high aspect ratios wherein the ratio of feature height to feature width can be 4:1 or higher. Additionally, as the feature widths decrease, the device current remains constant or increases, which results in an increased current density in the feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Elemental aluminum (Al) and its alloys have been the traditional metals used to form lines and plugs in semiconductor processing because of aluminum&apos;s perceived low electrical resistivity, its superior adhesion to silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), its ease of patterning, and the ability to obtain it in a highly pure form. However, aluminum has a higher electrical resistivity than other more conductive metals such as copper, and aluminum also can suffer from electromigration leading to the formation of voids in the conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Copper and its alloys have lower resistivities than aluminum and significantly higher electromigration resistance as compared to aluminum. These characteristics are important for supporting the higher current densities experienced at high levels of integration and increase device speed. Copper also has good thermal conductivity and is available in a highly pure state. Therefore, copper is becoming a choice metal for filling sub-quarter micron, high aspect ratio interconnect features on semiconductor substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Despite the desirability of using copper for semiconductor device fabrication, choices of fabrication methods for depositing copper into very high aspect ratio features, such as a 4:1, having 0.35 micron (or less) wide vias are limited. As a result of these process limitations, plating, which had previously been limited to the fabrication of lines on circuit boards, is now being used to fill vias and contacts on semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Metal electroplating is generally known and can be achieved by a variety of techniques. A typical method generally comprises physical vapor depositing a barrier layer over the feature surfaces, physical vapor depositing a conductive metal seed layer, preferably copper, over the barrier layer, and then electroplating a conductive metal over the seed layer to fill the structure/feature. Finally, the deposited layers and the dielectric layers are planarized, such as by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), to define a conductive interconnect feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flow circuit schematic diagram of a prior art electrochemical plating system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for depositing copper or other metals on a wafer or other substrate. The plating system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which has one or more electroplating cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in which an electrolyte containing the material to be deposited, is circulated through each cell, to deposit the deposition material onto a wafer disposed within the cell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The deposition material is added to the electrolyte typically in the form of a chemical composition such as, for example, copper sulfate. The process of adding the deposition chemical to the electrolyte is often referred to as &ldquo;dosing&rdquo; and is usually performed by an electrolyte replenishment platform such as that indicated at <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, also often referred to as a &ldquo;chemical cabinet,&rdquo; typically includes a large tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in which the deposition chemical is mixed with the electrolyte. An analyzer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> analyzes the chemical composition of the electrolyte and indicates whether additional deposition chemical or other chemicals should be added to the electrolyte in the tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to maintain a desired composition of the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> typically includes a pump <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to pump the electrolyte from the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> though a supply line <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. To provide a sufficient flow of electrolyte to the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the supply line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is often relatively large. For example, to provide a flow of 30 gallons per minute from the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the supply line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> often has an inner diameter of 1 inch (25 mm) in many systems. Moreover, to save valuable clean room space adjacent to the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is often located a relatively large distance from the platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, including being located on another floor of the factory. Hence, many systems have a second, booster pump <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> positioned on the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to provide sufficient head pressure to the plating cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Prior to admitting the electrolyte into the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, many electroplating tool platforms have one or more filters <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> positioned upstream of the inlets to the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, to filter the electrolyte from the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Positioned downstream of the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the electroplating tool platform often has one or more intermediate holding tanks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to collect the flow of electrolyte from the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The electrolyte is then pumped by yet another pump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, via a return line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, back to the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for analyzing and dosing if needed. Another filter or set of filters <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is often provided on the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to filter the electrolyte before it is admitted to the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To maintain the quality of the deposition onto the substrate in the cells, it is often desirable to closely control the temperature of the electrolyte to facilitate the desired chemical reaction in the electrolytic cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In many systems such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the main holding tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the electrolyte replenishment platform <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> typically has a chiller unit installed in the tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to cool the electrolyte to the desired temperature prior to recirculating the electrolyte back into the cells <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The intermediate holding tanks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the main holding tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also usually have various sensors to monitor the electrolyte levels in the tanks. To avoid a potential overflow of hazardous electrolyte from the tanks, the flow rates by the various pumps <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are controlled to lower an excessive level of electrolyte in one tank and pump the excess to the other tank.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one illustrated embodiment of the present inventions, a method and apparatus for electroplating semiconductor substrates is provided which comprises recirculating electrolyte between an electrolyte reservoir and at least one electrolytic plating cell through a reservoir-cell fluid recirculation circuit disposed in an electroplating tool platform; and recirculating electrolyte between the reservoir and a dosing unit through a reservoir-dosing unit fluid recirculation circuit which couples a dosing system platform to the electroplating tool platform. The electrolyte is dosed in the dosing system platform with additives using the dosing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As explained in greater detail below, in one embodiment, the majority of the electrochemical deposition solution, which in this embodiment is an electrolyte, recirculates locally in the electroplating tool platform. A relatively small flow of electrolyte may be diverted to the dosing system platform to be analyzed and dosed as needed. In addition, dosing may be achieved in a pressurized flow line rather than in an unpressurized reservoir or holding tank. As a consequence of these and other features discussed below, the complexity of the overall system can be substantially reduced and the reliability increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the preceding is merely a brief summary of one embodiment of the present inventions and that numerous changes to the disclosed embodiments can be made in accordance with the disclosure herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. The preceding summary, therefore, is not meant to limit the scope of the inventions. Rather, the scope of the inventions is to be determined only by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The loading station <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> preferably includes one or more wafer cassette receiving areas <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, one or more loading station transfer robots <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and at least one wafer orientor <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The number and positions of the wafer cassette receiving areas, loading station transfer robots <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and wafer orientors included in the loading station <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be configured according to the desired throughput of the system. As shown for one embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the loading station <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes two wafer cassette receiving areas <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, two loading station transfer robots <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and one wafer orientor <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. A wafer cassette <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> containing wafers <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is loaded onto the wafer cassette receiving area <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to introduce wafers <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> into the electroplating tool platform.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a fluid flow circuit schematic diagram of the electro-chemical deposition system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes a main reservoir or holding tank <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> for the electrolyte. The main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is coupled by a first fluid recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, which recirculates the electrolyte from the reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the electrolytic cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and back to the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that, in this embodiment, the electrolyte recirculates between the main reservoir and the processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> while remaining primarily in the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. By recirculating locally in this reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, the complexity of the overall system can be substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To achieve this, it has been recognized by the present inventors that a relatively small flow of electrolyte may be diverted from the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and directed by a second fluid recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to be dosed and returned to the reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the electrolyte flowing through the processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> circulates primarily through the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. However, by diverting a relatively small flow through the reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the electrolyte flowing through the processing cells may be maintained at the desired chemical composition by the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In another feature of the illustrated embodiments, the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> has a dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, which does not require any dosing reservoir on the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> during normal dosing operations. Instead, as explained in greater detail below, the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the illustrated embodiment is primarily a pressurized flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> having a plurality of inlets <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> for each fluid chemical to be added to the flow of electrolyte flowing through the flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the complexity of the system may be substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For example, the electrochemical deposition system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the illustrated embodiment has only a single pump <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, which is disposed in the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Since the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> does not utilize an unpressurized reservoir for dosing, a pump which would be used to pump electrolyte from such a dosing reservoir may be eliminated. It is believed that the single pump <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> disposed in the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is sufficient to recirculate the electrolyte through the primary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and to recirculate the lesser flow of electrolyte through the secondary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> coupling the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Because the flow of electrolyte flowing the reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be relatively small (such as 0.1-5 gallons per minute (0.38 -18.9 liters), for example), the supply and return lines of the recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be made relatively small (such as a &frac34; inch (19 mm) inner diameter, for example). By comparison, the supply and return lines of the primary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may be on the order of 1&frac12; inch (38 mm) inner diameter or larger, to provide an electrolyte flow of 30 gallons (113.5 liters) per minute, for example, depending upon the size and number of processing cells in the tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For example, the average flow cross-sectional area of the primary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may be 100-300% larger than that of the reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, to provide an average flow rate in the primary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> that is 600-3000% larger than that of the reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The relative sizes of the recirculation circuits will of course depend upon the particular application. However, reducing the size of the supply and return lines of the recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is particularly convenient should the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> be located a large distance (such as 20 feet (6 meters) for example) or even on a different floor from the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For example, the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may be separated from the electroplating tool platform by 1-50 meters (3.3-164 feet) or more. Notwithstanding a large separation between the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, it is believed that an additional boost pump such as the pump <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the prior art system, for pumping the electrolyte from a chemical cabinet may be eliminated in many applications of an electroplating system in accordance with the present invention. However, in some applications, particularly those having a very large separation between the two platforms, a booster pump may be appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Still further, by eliminating a dosing reservoir from the dosing platform, the need for complex controls to balance the electrolyte level of such a dosing reservoir with the electrolyte level of a reservoir in the tool platform can be reduced or eliminated. Instead, if desired, the electro-chemical deposition system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may utilize a single reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> during plating operations such that the volume of the system may be readily fixed at a particular level. As a consequence, the controls may be substantially simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> has a filter or set of filters <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> disposed in the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. It is believed that these filters are sufficient to filter the electrolyte such another set of filters disposed in the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to filter the electrolyte flowing through the secondary recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be avoided if desired. </paragraph>

The main filter <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is also disposed in the main supply line to filter the electrolyte being pumped to the array of processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). A bleed indicated generally at <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> bleeds bubbles from the filter <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> and vents into the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The main supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes suitable shut-off and control valves <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which may be controlled manually or by the controller <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, in the illustrated embodiment, the main supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes two branched supply lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, each of which includes two branched supply lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Each supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a control and/or shut off valve <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Each supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>supplies a flow of electrolyte to the inlet of one of the processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the array. To control the electrolyte flow rate into the inlet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each processing cell, each processing cell supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a control loop comprising a control valve <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and a flow meter <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The flow rate control loop for each processing cell <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the controller <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or manually, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of return lines <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, each of which is coupled to an electrolyte discharge outlet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of an associated processing cell <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Each return line <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may have a shutoff and/or control valve <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a filter <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to filter the electrolyte being discharged from the associated processing cell <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The outlet of each filter <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is coupled to the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> provides a complete circuit for recirculating the electrolyte from the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the array of processing cells and back to the main reservoir. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrolyte flow remains substantially local within the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> while flowing in the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition to the return lines <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, other return lines feed into the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. More specifically, each filter <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of the array of processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a bypass line <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> with an associated shut-off control valve <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>which permits the flow of electrolyte to bypass the filter <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and return to the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> should it be desired. An anode bypass line <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>exchanges fresh electrolyte across the anode surface of the cell. The supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for each processing cell <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is coupled to a bypass line <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> with an associated shut-off control valve <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, which permits the flow of electrolyte to bypass the associated processing cell and return to the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> includes a dosing system supply line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) having an inlet coupled to an outlet <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of the main supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the dosing system supply line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> diverts a small flow of electrolyte from the main supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to an inlet <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the dosing system flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, and thus provides a pressurized flow of electrolyte through the dosing system flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. The dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of additive supply lines <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, each of which is coupled to one of a plurality of inlets <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> of the dosing system flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Each additive supply line <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is coupled to one of a plurality of source tanks <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to provide the various constituent chemicals of the desired electrolyte to the dosing system flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, an additive supply line <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is provided for each of the constituents, copper sulfate CuSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, sulfuric acid H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and hydrochloric acid HCl. The particular additives may vary, depending upon the desired electrochemical solution and the desired electrochemical deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> further includes a dosing system return line <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> having an inlet coupled to an outlet <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the dosing system flow line <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the dosing system return line <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is coupled to the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> provides a complete circuit for recirculating the electrolyte from the main reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and back to the main reservoir. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrolyte remains pressurized within the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> while flowing in the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The electrolyte does not become unpressurized until it flows back into the unpressurized reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the tool platform <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The electrolyte in the reservoir-dosing recirculation unit circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is pressurized by the pump <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> which is shared with the reservoir-cell recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the chemical composition of the electrolyte flowing through the reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is analyzed by an analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> disposed in the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The reservoir-dosing system recirculation circuit <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> includes an analyzer sample supply line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> coupled to the supply line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> through a controller <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, which diverts a small sample flow of electrolyte from the supply line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to the analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for chemical analysis. An analyzer sample return line <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> returns the sample flow of electrolyte to the return line <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> at a point downstream of the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sample flow of electrolyte through the sample supply line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the sample return line <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> remains pressurized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The supply line <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a pressure drop <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> which may be set at a particular value (such as 1 gallon (3.8 liters) per minute, for example) to provide the desired flow into the sample supply line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. A bypass line <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> continues the flow of pressurized electrolyte to the sample return line <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the illustrated embodiment is a titration and CBS type analyzer (&ldquo;Bantam&rdquo; model) and is manufactured by Parker Technology. Other commercially available analyzers may be used as well. The analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has a syringe to withdraw a sample from the sample flow for analysis. The analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to one or more of the controllers <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and provides electrical signals to the appropriate controller, which are representative of the chemical analysis of the sample drawn from the electrolyte flowing through the analyzer. In response the controller, as needed, opens the appropriate control valves <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) coupled to the additive inlets <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to admit the appropriate quantities of additives to mix with the flow of electrolyte flowing through the dosing flow line <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the dosing unit <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired chemical composition of the electrolyte in the system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The control valves <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may include appropriate flow meters to measure the flow of additive in the associated additive inlet to provide a suitable flow control loop for each additive inlet <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Because a pressurized flow line is used to perform dosing rather than a large reservoir, the size or footprint of the dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may be substantially reduced as compared to many prior chemical cabinets. Furthermore, a single dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; may be used to dose and/or analyze the electrolyte from a plurality of electroplating tool platforms <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> while maintain a relatively small footprint. The dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; may use one set of additive sources <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to supply the additives for each of the dosing units of the platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime;. A single analyzer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be used to analyze the electrolyte from each of the tool platforms or alternatively, separate analyzers may be disposed on the platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; for use with the electrolyte from each tool if more complete separation of the flow lines is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> further has a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which is coupled by supply and return lines <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to a chiller unit <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. It is believed that the primary source of undesirable heating of the electrolyte is the pump or pumps of the system. In a system in accordance with the present invention, the size and number of pumps may be reduced because most of the electrolyte circulates locally on the electroplating tool platform <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The need to overcome a large head loss resulting from shuttling most or all of the system electrolyte to and from a remote chemical cabinet can be reduced or eliminated. As a consequence, the drop in pump horsepower which the system may require can reduce the system cooling requirements at the same time. Moreover, it is believed that the electrolyte temperature may be more effectively controlled in many applications because the heat exchanger is located close to the point of delivery to the processing cells. In one embodiment, the reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (and associated heat exchanger <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>) may be located immediately adjacent to the processing cells <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the reservoir <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be spaced less than 1 or 2 meters (3.3 or 6.6 feet) from the processing cells but is preferably spaced less than 5 meters (16.4 feet) from the processing cells to reduce pumping needs and increase temperature control accuracy. Of course, the actual distance may vary depending upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The dosing system platform <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> has a maintenance reservoir <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and associated maintenance plumbing indicated generally at <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>.
