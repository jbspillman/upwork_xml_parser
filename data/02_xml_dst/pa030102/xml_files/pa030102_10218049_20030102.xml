<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for correcting aberrations of the human eye, and a method relating to manufacturing the same. More particularly, the invention relates to a wavefront aberrator adapted to be placed on a human eye for correction of higher order aberrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In traditional optical systems having reflecting and refracting surfaces, it is common to assume that the light passing through the system is limited to paraxial rays, specifically, rays that are near the optical axis and are sustained within small angles. However, practical optical systems rarely are limited to paraxial rays, and thus, the actual images assumed by gaussian optics often depart from the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; image. This departure from the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; image results in the introduction of distortion into the optical system, called aberrations. These aberrations are most problematic in small focal ratio optical systems where the angle from the optical axis is larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a monochromatic optical system with only spherical surfaces, there are five (5) basic ray and wave aberrations, namely, spherical aberrations, coma, astigmatism, curvature of field, and distortion. Optical systems for use with multichromatic light have an additional source of distortion, namely, chromatic aberration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because the distortion introduced by aberrations into an optical system significantly degrades the quality of the images on the image plane of such system, there are significant advantages to the reduction of those aberrations. Various techniques are often used to minimize the aberrations. For example, in order to minimize spherical aberrations or coma, a lens may be &ldquo;bent&rdquo; to have different radii of curvature on opposite sides while maintaining a constant focal length, such as is contemplated by using the Coddington shape factor. Also, a pair of lenses, where one glass lens has a positive focal length, and the other made from a different glass has a negative focal length, are used together to correct spherical aberration. One example of this technique is the &ldquo;doublet&rdquo; lens in which the two lenses have the same radius of curvature on the facing sides, and are cemented together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Despite the available techniques to minimize the various aberrations, it is often difficult to simultaneously minimize all aberrations. In fact, corrections to an optical system to minimize one type of aberration may result in the increase in one of the other aberrations. This is particularly troublesome when analyzing the human eye as an optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The human eye, namely the cornea and lens, can exhibit a variety of aberrations that diminish the optical performance of the eye resulting in blurred vision. Historically, the optical aberrations have been corrected by introducing man made lenses such as spectacle or contact lenses in front of the human vision system. More recently, more permanent corrections have been made by surgical procedures and techniques such as intraocular lens insertion and corneal sculpting such as Radial Keratotomy, Astigmatic Keratotomy, Automated Lamellar Keratoplasty, Photo Refractive Keratectomy, or Laser In Situ Keratomileuis (LASIK). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The correction of blurred vision by lenses has typically been limited to correction of low order aberrations only, such as defocus and astigmatism. Traditionally, higher order aberrations, e.g. those describable with Zernike polynomials of the third order or higher, could not be corrected using lenses. In addition, due to lens manufacturing limitations and expenses, defocus and astigmatism are typically only corrected in discrete steps, with any correction being made to the nearest one quarter (&frac14;) diopter. Unfortunately, the resolution of one quarter (&frac14;) diopter results in incomplete vision corrections and limits the performance of the patients eye. An advantage of man-made lenses is that any continuing degradation in eye performance can be compensated with by a new lens derived from a current optical examination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Surgical procedures and techniques provide a more permanent vision correction than non-surgical approaches. Intraocular lenses are man-made lenses that are surgically inserted to replace the defective lens. Comeal sculpting entails various surgical procedures for the modification and alteration of the cornea. The advantage of surgical procedures is that they provide the opportunity for finer resolution corrections. However, any shift in the optical performance of the eye due to aging or trauma requires additional surgeries for corrections or the addition of man-made lenses. Also inherent in all surgical procedures is the risk of infection and permanent damage causing a further degradation in vision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a need exists for an optical element that will precisely compensate for optical aberrations, in addition to defocus and astigmatism, in human vision. This optical element must be easily replaceable as eye performance degrades with age or other defects. Thus, the optical correcting device must be incorporated into the human vision system in a non-invasive and repeatable manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the wavefront aberrator includes a pair of transparent windows, or plates, separated by a layer of monomers and polymerization initiators, such as a radiation curable resin. Various radiation curable resins are known to those skilled in the art. Preferred radiation curable resins exhibit a variable index of refraction as a function of the extent of curing, wherein the curing is induced by exposure to ultraviolet, visible, or infrared radiation. Preferably, curing of the radiation curable resin is made by exposure to ultraviolet light. The exposure to light may be varied across the surface of the radiation curable resin to create a particular and unique wavefront retardation profile such that when an ideal plane wave passes through the wavefront aberrator, a predetermined change of the wavefront profile can be affected by the wavefront aberrator. Conversely, if a distorted wavefront is known, such as by measuring the wavefront with a Hartmann/Shack sensor, a correction of such aberrated or distorted wavefront aberration may be achieved by first producing a complementary wavefront aberrator device such that if the abnormal wavefront passes through the wavefront aberrator device, a corrected plane wave emerges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One method of creating the wavefront aberrator of the present invention includes the exposure of the radiation curable resin to an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs). These LEDs may be selectively illuminated such that different regions of the radiation curable resin are exposed to different levels of illumination. This variance in illumination results in the creation of a wavefront aberrator having a varying index of refraction across its surface, and may include the formation of multiple sub-regions, where the index of refraction of the cured radiation curable resin in a sub-region has a constant index of refraction, with the index of refraction varying between adjacent sub-regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An alternative method of creating the wavefront aberrator of the present invention includes the exposure of the radiation curable resin to an array of LEDs through a demagnifier lens. In this manner, the LEDs may create a curing pattern which is then focused onto the surface of the radiation curable resin to create a similar, yet smaller, version of the curing pattern to provide for reduced-sized wavefront aberrators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another alternative method of creating the wavefront aberrator of the present invention includes the creation of a curing pattern by the transmission of light through a liquid crystal display (LCD). A non-coherent light source may be positioned adjacent to a diffuser to create a diffused light source. This diffused light may then be transmitted through a LCD containing a curing pattern, and onto a wavefront aberrator. As the radiation curable resin is exposed, the curing pattern on the LCD creates the desired refractive index profile. New patterns may be generated by changing the pattern on the LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A sensor may be placed beneath the wavefront aberrator to monitor the transmitted image of the curing pattern. The output of this sensor may be used to actively modulate the transmission of light through the LCD to create a wavefront aberrator having a desired refractive index profile, and to provide for an active monitor and control of the curing of each sub-region of the wavefront aberrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another alternative method of creating the wavefront aberrator of the present invention includes the creation of a curing pattern by the selective illumination of regions of the radiation curable resin using a point light source, such as a laser. This selective illumination may be accomplished by rastering a region of the surface of the radiation curable resin, varying the speed and/or intensity of the light source to vary the curing of the radiation curable resin. Alternatively, the light source may trace particular curing patterns directly onto the wavefront aberrator at various speeds and/or intensities of light, such as by raster or vector scanning the curing pattern onto the aberrator. Also, a positive or negative, or &ldquo;contact print,&rdquo; containing a particular wavefront retardation design may be positioned adjacent the wavefront aberrator and exposed to a diffused or collimated light to create the desired refractive index profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment provides for the correction of astigmatism and defocus in human vision that are induced by aberrations in the human eye by the cornea and lens. For example, if aberrations, or distortion in a human eye are known to create a distorted wave front, a correction of such aberrated or distorted wave front may be achieved by producing a complementary Wavefront Aberrator device such that passing the abnormal wave front through the Wavefront Aberrator device, a plane wave emerges. By placing the Wavefront Aberrator device on the surface, or cornea, of the eye, a higher degree of vision correction may be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the Wavefront Aberrator includes a pair of transparent windows, or plates, separated by a layer of monomers and polymerization initiators, such as a radiation curable resin (e.g. an epoxy). This radiation curable resin exhibits an index of refraction which varies as a function of the extent of its curing. Curing the radiation curable resin may be made by exposure to light such as ultraviolet light. The exposure to the light may be varied across the surface of the radiation curable resin to create a particular and unique wavefront retardation profile such that when an ideal plane wave passes through the Wavefront Aberrator, a predetermined change of the wave front profile can be effected by the Wavefront Aberrator device. </paragraph>

Also, for purposes of illustration, the transparent covers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as being substantially planar. However, it is to be appreciated that the covers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be curved to provide a non-planar aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In addition, those of skill in the art will recognize that an aberrator may comprise only a radiation curable resin layer, without the need for the upper and lower transparent covers <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating a top view of the wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. A barrier, such as circular barrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, may be positioned surrounding radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to retain the placement of the radiation curable resin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> between upper transparent cover <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and lower transparent cover <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the radiation curable resin may be shaped for placement directly on the eye, without the need for the upper and lower transparent covers <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Radiation curable resin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is, in a preferred embodiment, a light-curable resin comprised of monomers and polymerization initiators. The refractive index of the resin changes as the resin is cured, and it varies between locations within the resin layer depending on the extent of curing of the radiation curable resin. The extent of curing is determined by the percentage of cross-linking between the monomers within the radiation curable resin. Suitable resins include VLE-4101 UV-Visible Light Cure Epoxy, available from Star Technology, Inc., or Optical Adhesive &num;63, U.V. Curing, available from Norland Products, Inc. Typically, these resins are curable by exposure to UV or visible light radiation in the range of 300 to 550 nanometers (300-550 nm). Generally, the concepts described herein apply to any type of radiation curable resin that exhibits an index of refraction change upon curing and the corresponding curing light source may have wavelengths ranging between 300 nm and 3000 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that many other suitable radiation curable resins exist which exhibit a similar change in index of refraction upon exposure to light. Other monomers that polymerize into long-chain molecules using photo-initiators may also be used. For example, a suitable monomer may be chosen from the family of epoxides, urethanes, thiol-enes, acrylates, cellulose esters, or mercapto-esters, and a broad class of epoxies. Also, for example, a suitable photo-initiator may be chosen from alpha cleavage photo-initiators such as the benzoin ethers, benzyl ketals, acetophenones, or phosphine oxides, or hydrogen abstraction photo-initiators such as the benzophenones, thioxanthones, camphorquinones, or bisimidazole, or cationic photo-initiators such as the aryldiazonium salts, arylsulfonium and aryliodonium salts, or ferrocenium salts. Alternatively, other photo-initiators such as the phenylphosphonium benzophene salts, aryl tert-butyl peresters, titanocene, or NMM may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;radiation curable resin&rdquo; also refers to polymers having a refractive index that can be altered by exposure to radiation. Liquid crystal polymers are comprised of mesogenic units that can be preferentially oriented by various methods, including by mechanical processing or by the application of an electromagnetic field. See, e.g., A. Ciferri et al., &ldquo;Polymer Liquid Crystals,&rdquo; Academic Press, New York, 1982; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,319,113 and 5,237,076. The refractive index is preferably controlled by controlling the orientation of the mesogenic units, and thus in preferred embodiments chemical reactions involving polymerization initiators are unecessary. A variety of liquid crystal polymers are know to those skilled in the art in which the mesogenic units are in the polymer backbone and/or in a side chain. Side chain liquid crystal polymers are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a light source containing a particular wavelength irradiates the monomer layer which activates the photo-initiator and begins the curing process within the radiation curable resin. Curing of liquid crystal polymers is preferably conducted by heating to increase the mobility of the mesogenic units, then applying an electromagnetic field to orient the mesogens. The curing process results in a corresponding change of the index of refraction within the resin. However, it is also to be appreciated that terminating the exposure to the particular wavelength of light ceases the curing of the radiation curable resin, and ceases the change of the index of refraction exhibited by the radiation curable resin. In this manner, an aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be formed by exposing certain regions of the radiation curable resin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to a light source which varies with time and position, resulting in an aberrator having a varied index of refraction across its surface. The selectively cured aberrator may be in the form of a lens or lens element to be placed in front of an eye, e.g., in the manner of an eyeglass. Preferably, the selectively cured aberrator is shaped for placement on an eye. Placement of the aberrator in front of or onto the eye preferably corrects lower order and/or higher order aberrations. In one embodiment, a contact lens comprises the cured radiation curable resin. In another embodiment, a contact lens comprises the cured radiation curable resin adhered to one or more lenses. In another embodiment, an eyeglass lens comprises a liquid crystal polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> variety of refractive index profiles are shown to be formed in a radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. More specifically, different refractive index profiles are illustrated by regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, such that aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes three (3) distinct levels of refractive index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the incorporation of three (3) different levels of refractive index in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is merely exemplary. One of skill in the art will recognize that the concepts described herein may be applied to a system comprising any number of refractive index profiles, and that those different profiles may be formed within radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to have virtually any shape or local curvature. Moreover, the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be considered to be an array of pixels, such as pixels <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, which may each be selectively illuminated and cured to exhibit a particular index of refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating a cross-sectional view of the wavefront aberrator taken along line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown. Radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between upper transparent cover <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and lower transparent cover <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and held in place by barrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The enclosed volume of radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is determined by the size of barrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and the distance between upper transparent cover <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and lower transparent cover <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the range of approximately 0.002 to 0.1 inches 0.0508 to 2.54 mm); upper transparent cover <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the range of approximately 0.02 to 0.1 inches (0.508 to 2.54 mm); and lower transparent cover <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the range of approximately 0.02 to 0.1 inches(0.0508 to 2.54 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, upper transparent cover <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and lower transparent cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed from a rigid transparent material, such as glass or plastic. While glass provides a stable platform for the formation of the refractive index profile, such rigidity is not necessary. In fact, covers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be made from a flexible material, such as a transparent polymer. A suitable transparent polymer may include, but not be limited to, mylar film, polycarbonate film, or acetate film. Use of such materials results in a flexible aberrator having a distinct refractive index profile. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating a system for manufacturing the wavefront aberrator is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a light emitting diode (LED) array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> having a number of diodes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, separated from adjacent diodes by a distance <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and controlled by a computer <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> through interface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the distance <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> between diodes <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> varies, and may typically be approximately 0.125 inches (3.175 mm), though alternative distances may be used. A diffuser element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be placed between LED array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to diffuse the light emitted by the LED array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to create a smoother refractive index profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In operation, once a desired refractive index profile is determined, computer <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> determines a particular pattern to be illuminated in the LED array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> thereby generating a curing pattern which is directed through diffuser element <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> onto aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. By selectively illuminating particular LEDs <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, for example, within the LED array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the radiation curable resin (not shown this Figure) is selectively cured. This selective curing creates a predetermined, particular refractive index profile corresponding to the time of exposure of the radiation curable resin as well as the intensity of the exposure. This selective curing results in an aberrator with areas having different indices of refraction. Thus, by varying the intensity and period of illumination of LEDs <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, for example, the aberrator may be formed to exhibit the desired refractive index profile. For embodiments in which a liquid crystal polymer is used as the radiation curable resin, the LED array provides sufficient heat to mobilize the mesogenic units, which are subsequently aligned by applying an electromagnetic field of pre-determined magnitude (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an diagram illustrating a system for manufacturing the wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in a side view and generally designated <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes an LED array panel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> where each LED <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> generates a light beam <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> having an diverging angle <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and the LEDS collectively generate a curing pattern which is directed through a demagnifier imaging element <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> which focusses the curing pattern into light pattern <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and onto a wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to cure the radiation curable resin (not shown this Figure) within the aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to create a particular wavefront profile as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the curing pattern can be magnified, instead of demagnified, to produce a larger area aberrator device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a system for manufacturing the wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is generally designated <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes a light source <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> adjacent a diffuser <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which smooths the light beams <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and creates uniform intensity light rays <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Light rays <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> pass through a computer controlled LCD <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> which acts as a spatial light intensity modulator and generates a curing pattern <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> such that when the LCD is exposed to light rays <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> from light source <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, light corresponding to the curing pattern <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the LCD <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and onto the wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to create a particular refractive index profile <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, light source <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of system <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is a constant fluence light having a constant intensity across the illuminated surface of the light. For example, light source <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> may contain an array of LEDs, or any other suitable source of illumination. The optical transmissive properties of the LCD can be controlled by applying a variable electrical voltage to an array of electrodes on an LCD device. This provides for the spatial and temporal variation of the intensity of light transmitted through the LCD device to selectively cure the resin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For embodiments in which a liquid crystal polymer is used as the radiation curable resin, the constant fluence light source provides sufficient heat to mobilize the mesogenic units, which are subsequently aligned by applying an electromagnetic field of pre-determined magnitude (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As an addition to system <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, a detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> may be placed beneath aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to detect the transmitted image <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> through aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A feedback interface <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> may connect detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> to computer <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>, which may in turn control LCD panel <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a refractive index profile may be determined in the computer <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>, implemented in the LCD <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, and verified by detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, thereby ensuring the appropriate wavefront profile was created in aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> may comprise an intensity imager, such as a CCD, or a wavefront sensor, such as a Shack-Hartmann sensor, or any other optical sensor known in the art. A preferred wavefront sensor is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/014,037, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Although panel <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is discussed above as a LCD panel, an alternative embodiment could incorporate a photographic negative or positive that may be used to form the refractive index profile <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> in aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this manner, light source <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> would present a constant source of illumination, and the photographic negative or positive containing the refractive index profile <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> would control the spatial and intensity level of illumination reaching aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to create the proper refractive index profile <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating an alternative system for manufacturing the wavefront aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. System <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> includes a beam scan unit <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> having a laser unit <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> generating a laser beam <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> which forms a point light source (&ldquo;spot&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> on aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which may include a laser intensity control (not shown). Spot <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is moved across the surface of the aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a rastering path shown by dashed lines <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, at varying speeds and with varying intensities to selectively cure the radiation curable resin <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to create a particular refractive index profile <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> having areas <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, with different indices of refraction. For embodiments in which a liquid crystal polymer is used as the radiation curable resin, the laser provides sufficient heat to mobilize the mesogenic units, which are subsequently aligned by applying an electromagnetic field of pre-determined magnitude (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a spot <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be formed and moved across aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in paths <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Yet another alternative method of forming refractive index profile <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> includes the formation of spot <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the center of aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and movement of the spot along an outwardly spiraling path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Also, a particular refractive index profile <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be traced, or circumscribed in a predetermined area, by laser beam <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> directly forming the boundaries between the areas <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, for example. In an alternative embodiment, laser beam <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> may remain stationary and the aberrator device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be moved relative to the laser beam <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> such that the spot <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> moves across the surface of the aberrator. Specifically, aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be moved in directions <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> to move the spot <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> across the surface of the aberrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As an addition to system <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, a detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> may be placed beneath aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to detect the transmitted spot <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> through aberrator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating a method of measuring a refractive index profile (the term &ldquo;refractive index profile&rdquo; is herein synonymous with &ldquo;index of refraction profile&rdquo; and &ldquo;IRP&rdquo;) of an aberrator and providing feedback to an irradiating device, e.g a constant fluence light or laser beam, according to a measured index of refraction profile. The feedback method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> may be implemented with any system of manufacturing a aberrator. For example, the feedback method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> may be used when manufacturing a aberrator using a light source that passes through a selectively transmissive LCD device (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) or a point light source that varies speed and intensity at particular regions of the wavefront aberrator in order to create the desired IRP (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, an ultimate index of refraction profile (&ldquo;IRP&rdquo;) is determined. In one embodiment, the ultimate IRP is determined from an examination of the eye for which the aberrator will be used for correction. The ultimate IRP comprises information regarding a refractive index of various regions of the aberrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, an irradiating device, such as a constant fluence light or laser beam, is activated according to the ultimate IRP. For example, in an embodiment using a constant fluence light to selectively cure the radiation curable resin, the light may pass through an LCD panel that is configured to be selectively light transmissive according to the ultimate IRP. Similarly, in an embodiment using a laser beam to cure the radiation curable resin, the speed and intensity of the laser on different regions of the radiation curable resin varies according to the ultimate IRP. However, any method of irradiating (curing) the radiation curable resin will have an inherent error factor, such that the actual IRP of the aberrator may not be the same as the ultimate IRP). As such, further adjustments may be necessary to the aberrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, the IRP of the wavefront aberrator is determined. In the embodiments of both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, a detector <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> placed next to the aberrator opposite the irradiating device measures the IRP of the aberrator. Thus, as the radiation curable resin is cured, the actual IRP of the aberrator may be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, the aberrator RP (determined in block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>) is compared to the ultimate IRP (determined in block <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>). As mentioned above, the objective of the irradiation of the radiation curable resin is to selectively change the IRP of regions of the aberrator so that the ultimate IRP is substantially equal to the aberrator IRP. As such, if the aberrator IRP is not substantially equal to the ultimate IRP, the method continues to blocks <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> where additional adjustments to the aberrator IRP are made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, an adjustment RP to be applied to the aberrator is determined. In one embodiment, the adjustment IRP comprises the difference between the ultimate IRP and the aberrator IRP (determined in block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>). The objective of the adjustment IRP is to further cure the radiation curable material so that the aberrator IRP is substantially equal to the ultimate IRP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>, the irradiating device is activated according to the adjustment IRP. As such, portions of the radiation curable resin that require additional curing are further irradiated in order to achieve the ultimate IRP in the aberrator. After the aberrator has been further cured according to the adjustment IRP the process returns to block <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> which determines the aberrator IRP and block <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> which determines whether the aberrator IRP is substantially equal to the ultimate IRP. In this way, blocks <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> may be repeated a number of times until the aberrator IRP is substantially equal to the aberrator IRP. </paragraph>

Transparent cover <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> has a spherical refractive surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> which functions as an optical element. Thus, the cover <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in combination with radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, provides for an optical element having both focusing and wavefront phase profile characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the wavefront aberrator is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and generally designated <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Aberrator <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes an upper transparent window <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and an adjacent layer <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of index-changing radiation curable resin. A lower transparent window <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> (shown in dashed lines) is formed from a soluble salt. Once the refractive index profile has been formed in layer <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of radiation curable resin, salt window <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> may be dissolved. The soluble nature of window <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> provides for an exposed radiation curable resin layer facilitating post-curing treatment of the radiation curable resin, if necessary. Alternatively, windows <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> may be made of organic materials which are soluble in organic solvents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The embodiments discussed and suggested herein may be used to correct aberrations in virtually any optical system. For instance, the one embodiment may be particularly useful to correct inherent static aberrations in optical imaging systems, such as telescopes, binoculars, or microscopes. In addition, the concepts discussed herein may be applied to ophthalmic surgical or diagnostic systems, wherein the eye is a part of the system, such that improvement in the eye&apos;s aberration improves the way the system functions. For example, in an eye surgery, e.g. retinal surgery, the embodiments discussed herein may reduce or remove aberrations present in the eye such that better focusing of the laser may be achieved. Also, the concepts discussed herein may be advantageous when used in a fundus camera, slit lamp biomicroscope, ophthalmoscope, or scanning laser ophthalmoscopes, wherein the image quality may be improved by diminishing or removing aberrations in the optic system. Another embodiment may also be particularly useful by incorporating aberration corrections into eyepieces of optical systems such as telescopes, binoculars, or microscopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The aberrator of may also be used to correct static aberrations in laser beams or associated optics for use in laser ranging, detection, scanning, communication, or tracking instruments. This listing of uses for the various embodiments are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention whatsoever. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the Wavefront Aberrator is shown and generally designated <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> allows for the correction of localized and non-uniform distortions of the human eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the manufacture of more complex prescriptions than traditional techniques. The human eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is comprised of multiple components, including the cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the retina <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is placed directly upon the anterior surface of cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Localized defects in the cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> typically dominate the error sources that contribute to the degradation of visual acuity in the human eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Examples of these localized defects are illustrated by several different regions <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> possessing different radii of focus. As an image wavefront passes through cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the wavefront encounters localized defects <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and non-uniform distortion sources which causes the wavefront image to become non-coherently defocused thus causing degradation in a person&apos;s vision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which has an inner lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, an outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and a radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> sandwiched between inner lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, formed in radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are a number of refractive index profiles designated <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Importantly, these profiles <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are positioned to correspond to defects <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As will be discussed below, the identification of defects <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> lends itself directly to the creation of a wavefront aberrator containing corresponding, canceling refractive index profiles <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, such that when light passes through aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and into eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, any defects in the cornea are exactly compensated for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown to include a barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> which surrounds radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> in order to retain it between outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and inner lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Also shown is a weighted appendage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> which serves to orient the lens properly on the cornea due to the gravitational force on appendage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. People skilled in the art will also recognize that other method for ensuring the orientation of the lens on the cornea, such as by proper shaping of the lens, may be equally effective in certain embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Regions <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are shown to depict areas where radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> has been cured to create the refractive index profile necessary to compensate for the defects <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> depict a number of refractive index profiles, it is to be appreciated that the incorporation of these different regions of correction is merely exemplary, and alternative embodiments incorporating any number of regions of correction are contemplated. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that this illustration references defects in the cornea. However, it is contemplated that aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be utilized to compensate for any and all aberrations that contribute to the degradation of the human vision system, including but not limited to the error components (aberrations) contributed by the various components of the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, including cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, lens <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, and retina <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In use, aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is placed directly upon the anterior surface of the cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As the wavefront enters the corrected human vision system, the wavefront traverses aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> creates a translated wavefront. The translated wavefront is designed to be 180 degrees out of phase with the impulse response of the uncorrected human vision system. When the wavefront translated by aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> passes through the uncorrected human vision system, the perceived wavefront is identical to the wavefront impinging upon the outer surface of the corrected human vision system, and thus visual acuity is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> having meniscus lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that one or both of these lenses may be formed with a refractive characteristic, thereby providing an overall correction to the eye. Alternatively, lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be formed to have little or no refractive qualities, providing for the entire optical correction to be realized within the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the relationship between the inner transparent lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the outer transparent lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the radiation curable resin barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The enclosed volume of radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is determined by the volume enclosed by the radiation curable resin barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the inner transparent lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and the outer transparent lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, inner transparent lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> can be formed from a gas-permeable flexible or soft lens material, such as a transparent polymer, to increase patient comfort. The outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be made of a rigid gas permeable material to provide structural rigidity of the combined lens. Alternatively, both the inner and outer lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> can be made of rigid or soft lens material. The typical thickness of the outer, inner and cured resin material, i.e. the entire contact lens, ranges from about 0.03 to 0.5 mm. Exemplary thickness of the lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are as follows: inner transparent lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.005 inches (0.125 mm); radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.005 inches (0.125 mm); and outer transparent lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> has a thickness <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of approximately 0.005 inches (0.125 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating a front view of the Wavefront Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown. A barrier, such as circular barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, may be positioned surrounding the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to retain the radiation curable resin between the inner and outer transparent lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be fused together about their edges to seal radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> between them, thereby providing for a thinner aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, facilitating the use of the aberrator on a human eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The fusing together of lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> about their edges, may be done by applying heat, by applying pressure, by applying radiation (e.g., a laser emission), by applying a chemical means such as a solvent or catalyst, or by a combination of any two or more of these methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> variety of refractive index profiles are shown to be formed in radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. More specifically, different refractive index profiles are illustrated by regions <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, such that aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes several distinct levels of refractive indices. It is also to be appreciated that the different profiles may be formed within radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to have virtually any shape or local curvature to accommodate virtually any defect in the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional view of the Wavefront Aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> properly placed on the human eye. Specifically, aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> rides on a thin film of aqueous fluid <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> on the outer surface of cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Once in place, aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> modifies the wavefront before in enters cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and passes through lens <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to retina <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Appendage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> aids in maintaining aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in proper rotational orientation with the optical axis to insure proper orientation of the modified wavefront with respect to the aberrations in the eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The curvature of lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> provides a centering force which maintains aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in position on cornea <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> are diagrams illustrating a front and cross-sectional views of an alternative embodiment, which is generally designated <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Aberrator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is similar in many respects to the aberrator shown and described with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In particular, aberrator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises a radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> between the inner and outer transparent lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. However, in contrast to some of the other embodiments, aberrator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> does not require a barrier layer (e.g., barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>) to retain the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> For example, aberrator <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is shown having a cured resin region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is positioned near the perimeter of the aberrator. Because of the adhesive properties of particular light curable resins that may be utilized, the cured resin region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may function in a manner similarly to the barrier layer utilized by some of the other embodiments. In particular, the cured resin region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be used to bond the inner and outer lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, as well as for containing the radiation curable resin of the radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Cured radiation curable resin region <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is typically formed by curing a region of the existing layer of radiation curable resin <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> in an appropriate manner so that a seal is created between the inner and outer lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Curing techniques that may be used include heat, pressure, radiation, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Methods of Manufacturing the Aberrator for the Eye </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The aberrator <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference> may be manufactured by any of several methods. In these methods, lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to be placed on an eye <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In one method, the first step is that either the convex surface of inner lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, or the concave surface of outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, is coated with radiation curable resin to form radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Next, the other of the convex surface of inner lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the concave surface of outer lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, is placed on the exposed surface of radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Finally, radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is cured with light according to a desired refractive index profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In another method, radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is cured before the other of lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is placed on radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In yet another method, a barrier <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is placed to surround radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, in order to retain radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> between lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, either just before the radiation curable resin is placed on lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, or just before the other of lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is placed on radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In a fourth method, the edges of lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are fused together, in order to retain radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> between lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, just after the other of lens <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is placed on radiation curable resin layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The edges of lenses <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> may be fused together by heating them, by pressing them together, by irradiating them (e.g., with a laser emission), by applying a chemical means such as a solvent or catalyst to them, or by a combination of any two or more of these methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> While there have been shown what are presently considered to be preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
