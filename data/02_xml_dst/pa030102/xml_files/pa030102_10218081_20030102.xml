<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a trocar and a trocar system, wherein a trocar tube, which is to be inserted in a patient&apos;s body and used as a guide tube for an instrument inserted in the body cavity, is made to stay in a state in which the tube has pierced and penetrated the patient&apos;s skin and body wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, in the prior art, there is used a trocar apparatus wherein a trocar tube, which is to be inserted in a patient&apos;s body and used as a guide tube for an instrument inserted in the body cavity, is made to stay in a state in which the tube has pierced and penetrated the patient&apos;s skin and body wall. In the trocar apparatus, a trocar needle having a pointed pierce needle at its distal end is detachably combined with a tube having an insertion portion to be inserted in a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the trocar apparatus is to be used, the trocar needle and the tube are integrally combined in advance. In this state, the tip end of the trocar needle is made to pierce the patient&apos;s skin, and the trocar needle and tube are made to pierce the body wall and are inserted in the body cavity. Further, after the trocar has been inserted in the body cavity, the trocar needle is drawn out of the tube and thus the tube is made to stay in the body wall. Thereby, the tube can be used as a guide tube for an optical scope or an instrument for observation and treatment of a diseased part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKOKU Publication No. 5-57863, for instance, discloses an apparatus for inserting a trocar into the body cavity using ultrasonic oscillation. In the state in which a trocar needle and a tube are integrally combined, ultrasonic oscillation is transmitted to the trocar needle. The trocar needle, while being oscillated by ultrasonic waves, is made to pierce the patient&apos;s skin and body wall. In this case, by virtue of ultrasonic oscillation, the trocar can safely be made to pierce, and inserted in, the patient&apos;s body wall with a relatively weak force. Thus, the tube for guiding the instrument for treatment, etc. is inserted and made to stay in the body wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-89851 shows an ultrasonic trocar system with different construction. In this system, a substantially conical, tapered adapter is provided between a trocar needle with a relatively small outside diameter and a tube. The small-diameter trocar needle is used when the trocar is inserted. Thereby, the diameter of the pierce hole made by the trocar needle in the patient&apos;s body wall is decreased and the degree of invasion on the patient is reduced. Further, the tapered adapter is inserted in the pierce hole made in the body wall. The tapered adapter increases the diameter of the pierce hole made in the body wall by the trocar needle up to the outside diameter of the tube. Accordingly, the large-diameter tube can smoothly be inserted in the pierce hole in the patient&apos;s body wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the trocar needle, which is being oscillated by ultrasonic, is made to pierce the patient&apos;s skin and body wall, as disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKOKU Publication No. 5-57863, heat may affect the living tissue due to contact with the trocar needle that is being oscillated by ultrasonic. In order to minimize the invasion on the living tissue when the trocar needle is made to pierce the body wall, it is necessary to make the trocar needle pierce the body wall within a minimum possible time period by using the trocar needle with a relatively small outside diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus of Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-89851, the diameter of a small-diameter pierce hole is increased by a conical portion of a tapered adapter up to a relatively large outside diameter of the tube. Thus, the axial length of that portion of the tapered adapter, which projects from the distal end of the tube, is relatively long. Where the distal projecting portion of the tapered adapter is long, it is possible that while the diameter of the pierce hole is being increased by the adapter, the distal end of the adapter may come in contact with, and press, an organ in the abdominal cavity. It is thus desirable that the distal projecting portion of the adapter be made as short as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, where the distal projecting portion of the adapter is short, it is possible that when the adapter is inserted in the pierce hole in the patient&apos;s body wall, it may not pierce the abdominal wall. In such a case, a time-consuming work is required. For example, the adapter used during the treatment has to be replaced with another adapter having a longer distal projecting portion. As a result, the time of work for inserting the tube in the body wall and staying it therein will increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the conventional trocar apparatus, the proximal end portion of the trocar needle is engaged with the proximal end portion of the tube with a relatively weak force by means of a resilient ring such as a C-ring. Consequently, when the trocar needle is made to piece the patient&apos;s body wall, the engagement between the proximal end portion of the tube and the proximal end portion of the trocar needle may be released if the user holds the trocar apparatus at an undesirable position. As a result, the operation of the trocar apparatus becomes unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the length of the distal projecting portion of the trocar needle, which projects from the distal end of the tube, is fixed at a predetermined value. While the trocar needle is being made to pierce the patient&apos;s body wall, the amount of insertion of the distal end portion of the trocar needle is determined by the sense of the finger, the experience, etc. in accordance with conditions such as the thickness of the body wall or the location of piercing. This work is difficult and time-consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in consideration of the above circumstances. An object of the invention is to provide a trocar system wherein when a small-diameter pierce hole made by a trocar needle is increased up to an outside diameter of a tube, an organ in the abdominal cavity, for instance, is not pressed and the tube can easily and quickly be inserted and stayed in the body wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a trocar system wherein when a small-diameter pierce hole made by a trocar needle is increased up to an outside diameter of a tube, an organ in the abdominal cavity, for instance, is not pressed and the tube can easily and quickly be inserted and stayed in the body wall, and also the work for inserting a distal end portion of the trocar needle can be easily and stably performed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically shows the entire structure of a trocar system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. This trocar system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of an ultrasonic trocar, which is held and operated by the operator. The handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to an ultrasonic oscillation device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> over a connection cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The ultrasonic oscillation device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supplies energy for ultrasonic oscillation. The ultrasonic oscillation device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to an output control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, such as a foot switch or a hand switch, for controlling energy output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic trocar comprises a trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for piercing into the body wall; a tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in which the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inserted; a dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> inserted between the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>; and a guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> formed of a soft cylindrical member and inserted in the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be formed of a hard member. The handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic trocar of this embodiment is selectively used in two modes: an assembled mode in which the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are combined, and a disassembled mode in which these elements are separated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a state in which the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided with a substantially straight probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A proximal-side handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed at a proximal end portion of the probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The proximal-side handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with a substantially cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes an ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is an element for producing ultrasonic oscillation. A horn <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for amplifying ultrasonic oscillation is disposed at a distal end portion of the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A distal end portion of the horn <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extends forward from the end of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The distal end portion of the horn <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is detachably screwed to a proximal end portion of an ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod (oscillation transmission rod) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A distal end of the oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with a tapered pierce needle (needle body) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is tapered, for example, in a conical shape, a trigonal pyramidal shape or a quadrangular pyramidal shape. Thereby, mechanical oscillation of the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the distal-end pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided at the distal end of the ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The interval between O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the interval between O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are set at about 10 mm, respectively. When the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the second O-ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is detachably engaged with the O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in succession. Thus, when the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the user can sense a click and recognize the amount of draw-out of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> without observation by the naked eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The O-ring engagement groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is disposed at that area of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the final position in the draw-out direction of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A diameter d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this O-ring engagement groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is less than a diameter d of each of the other O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&lt;d). Thus, the O-ring engagement groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed to have the least depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As a result, when the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the intensity of operational sensation, i.e. the sensation of engagement, which is felt when the second O-ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is engaged with the O-ring engagement groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, is made greater than that obtained when the second O-ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is engaged with the other O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Thereby, the draw-out position of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can recognized more exactly by sensation. This also prevents unintentional draw-out of the guide member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> includes a handle portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The handle portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed to have a substantially truncated-conical cross section. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> small-diameter end portion of the handle portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is screwed to the inner periphery of the seal receiving ring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A tapered outer periphery of the handle portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is subject to non-slip treatment (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The inner periphery of the seal receiving ring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided with a stepped seal receiving portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C, a</cross-reference> circular air-tight seal member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed at the seal receiving portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The seal member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is, e.g. a rubber sheet. The seal member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is clamped and fixed between the seal receiving portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of seal receiving ring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the small-diameter end portion of handle portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A slit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed in a central portion of the seal member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The slit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a substantially straight shape. When the trocar system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is used, the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is inserted and assembled in the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this case, the distal end portion of the straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is held in the state in which it is projected from the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by a predetermined length. In this state, the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is held by the fingers, and the operation of axially pulling the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> relative to the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the operation of pushing it are properly combined. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, can be adjusted as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The operation of the above-described structure will now be described. When the trocar system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is to be used, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic trocar is, in advance, set in the assembled state, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are combined. At this time, the distal end portion of the straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is projected from the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by a predetermined length, and is kept in this state. In addition, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is projected from the distal end of the straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and kept in this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in its assembled state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is operated so that the trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may pierce and penetrate the patient&apos;s skin and body wall and may stay therein. At the time of the piercing operation of the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the ultrasonic oscillation device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is activated by the operation of the output control device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. At this time, energy for ultrasonic oscillation is supplied from the ultrasonic oscillation device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> over the connection cable <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produces ultrasonic oscillation. The ultrasonic oscillation produced from the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is amplified by the horn <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus, the mechanical oscillation of the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at the distal end of the ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through the horn <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Then, with the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being held, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made to pierce the patient&apos;s abdominal wall H, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. At this time, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> pierces the abdominal wall H in the state in which ultrasonic oscillation is being transmitted to the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is made to easily pierce the abdominal wall H with a weak force. With this operation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, a</cross-reference> small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made in the abdominal wall H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, after the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has been inserted up to the location of the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> near the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> alone is drawn out of the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this state, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is further inserted in the abdominal wall H. Thereby, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is increased up to the outside diameter of the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by means of the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Prior to the work for increasing the diameter of the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the following operation is performed when the distal end of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is projected from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is in the propinquity of an organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity. Specifically, the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is held by the fingers and the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is axially pulled from the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is decreased. At this time, the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> functions as a guide for the insertion of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In general terms, the body wall comprises a plurality of layers. Even if the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has pierced the body wall, once the pierce needle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the body wall, the pierce holes in the respective layers of the body wall are displaced due to muscles. In particular, the peritoneum that is the deepest layer of the body wall may easily be displaced. If the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is stayed in the body wall, the axis of insertion of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is guided by the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> while the pierce hole is being increased. This facilitates the work for increasing the diameter of the pierce hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In addition, while the diameter of the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is being increased, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is adjusted in accordance with the distance between the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity and the distal end of straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this work of adjusting the projection amount of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the operation of axially pulling the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> relative to the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the operation of axially pushing out the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are properly combined. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, can be adjusted as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When the diameter of the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be increased, the operation of pushing the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into the abdominal wall H and the operation of rotating it about the center axis of the trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as indicated by an arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, are simultaneously performed while the operation handle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the finger hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are being held. Thereby, with the operation of pushing the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the work for increasing the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> up to the outside diameter of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is performed. At the time of this work, the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is successively inserted into the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that has been enlarged by the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> up to a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inserted in the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Once the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has been inserted in the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is relatively firmly fixed in the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the abdominal wall H by the elasticity of the peripheral tissue of the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> enlarged by the insertion of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this state, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the assembly unit of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thus, the trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inserted and stayed in the pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of abdominal wall H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> With the above structure, the following advantages can be obtained. The trocar system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes the soft cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> projected from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that is interposed between the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is to be enlarged up to the outside diameter of the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be put in contact with the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity before the distal end portion of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity. Accordingly, during the dilation operation, the distal end portion of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is surely prevented from coming in contact with the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity, and the safety in the dilation operation is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> While the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is being held by the fingers, the operation of axially pulling the handle section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> relative to the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the operation of pushing it out are properly combined. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, can be desirably adjusted. Accordingly, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be desirably adjusted in accordance with conditions such as the thickness of the abdominal wall H that is to be pierced by the trocar tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, or the distance from the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, the organ H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the abdominal cavity will never be pressed during the dilation operation for increasing the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made in the abdominal wall H by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> up to the outside diameter of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the work for inserting and staying the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the abdominal wall H can be carried out easily and quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The straight breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided at the distal conical end portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a lateral force acts on the soft guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> projecting from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the force acting in such a direction as to bend the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at the distal conical portion of the pierce hole expansion hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be dispersed over the wide area of the straight breakage-prevention section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the conical distal portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is prevented from exerting a large local bending force to the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is protected against bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> During the dilation operation, the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be made to function also as the guide member for the dilation work. Thus, the operability of the dilation work of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the second O-ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fitted on the outer periphery of the alignment portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Further, the three O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed in the inner periphery of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the direction of insertion of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. When the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is pulled from the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the second O-ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is detachably engaged with the O-ring engagement grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in succession. Accordingly, when the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the user can sense a click and recognize the amount of draw-out of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by sensing. As a result, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which cannot directly be observed by the naked eye, can easily be recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> show a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is made by altering the structure of the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the trocar system of the first embodiment (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B) in the following fashion. Except for the altered portions, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the same structure as that in the first embodiment and a description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in this embodiment, the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having a relatively small diameter (e.g. about 5 mm) and a short length. The inside diameter of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is set to be substantially equal to, for example, the outside diameter of the straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment is omitted. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the straight portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the guide member <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is directly inserted in the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this embodiment, a cylindrical spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for wavelength adjustment of ultrasonic oscillation is provided between the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> small-diameter trocar needle coupling portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is provided at one of the spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A small-diameter cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is provided at the distal end of the coupling portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. An annular C-ring receiving groove <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer periphery of the small-diameter cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. A C-ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for engaging the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fitted in the receiving groove <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The C-ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is disposed at a position corresponding to the C-ring receiving portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of connection member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When the trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are to be coupled, the connection member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fitted on the coupling portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In this state, the C-ring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of trocar needle coupling portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is detachably engaged in the C-ring receiving portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to prevent disengagement. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The embodiment with the above-described structure has the following advantages. In this embodiment, the cylindrical spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for wavelength adjustment of ultrasonic oscillation is provided between the proximal end portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the handle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the length of the spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be adjusted in accordance with the oscillation characteristics of the ultrasonic oscillation produced by the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the probe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Even in the case of using a model wherein the diameter of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is relatively small and the length thereof is small, the length of the spacer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be adjusted. Thus, like the first embodiment wherein the dilator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is interposed between the tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic trocar can perform ultrasonic treatment. </paragraph>

The ultrasonic oscillation produced from the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is amplified by the horn <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Thus, the mechanical oscillation of the ultrasonic oscillation element <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> at the distal end of the ultrasonic oscillation transmission rod <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> through the horn <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Then, with the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> being held, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is made to pierce the patient&apos;s abdominal wall H. At this time, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> pierces the abdominal wall H in the state in which ultrasonic oscillation is being transmitted to the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is made to easily pierce the abdominal wall H with a weak force. With this operation, a small-diameter pierce hole H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made in the abdominal wall H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> After the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has been inserted up to the location of the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> near the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> alone is drawn out of the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In this state, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is further inserted in the abdominal wall H. Thereby, the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole made by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is increased up to the outside diameter of the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> by means of the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Prior to the work for increasing the diameter of the pierce hole, the following operation is performed when the distal end of the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which is projected from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, is in the propinquity of an organ in the abdominal cavity. Specifically, the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is held by the fingers and the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is axially pulled from the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, is decreased. At this time, the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> functions as a guide for the insertion of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In general terms, the body wall comprises a plurality of layers. Even if the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has pierced the body wall, once the pierce needle <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the body wall, the pierce holes in the respective layers of the body wall are displaced due to muscles. In particular, the peritoneum that is the deepest layer of the body wall may easily be displaced. If the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is stayed in the body wall, the axis of insertion of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is guided by the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> while the pierce hole is being increased. This facilitates the work for increasing the diameter of the pierce hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In addition, while the diameter of the pierce hole is being increased, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, is adjusted in accordance with the distance between the organ in the abdominal cavity and the distal end of straight portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. In this work of adjusting the projection amount of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, the operation of axially pulling the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> relative to the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the operation of axially pushing out the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> are properly combined. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, can be adjusted as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> When the diameter of the pierce hole is to be increased, the operation of pushing the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> into the abdominal wall H and the operation of rotating it about the center axis of the trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are simultaneously performed while the operation handle <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the finger hook portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are being held. Thereby, with the operation of pushing the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the work for increasing the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole up to the outside diameter of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is performed. At the time of this work, the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is successively inserted into the pierce hole that has been enlarged by the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> up to a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Thus, the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is inserted in the pierce hole in the abdominal wall H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> When the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> has been inserted in the pierce hole in the abdominal wall H, the pierce hole in the abdominal wall H is dilated by the insertion operation of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is relatively firmly fixed in the pierce hole in the abdominal wall H by the elasticity of the peripheral tissue of the pierce hole in the abdominal wall H. In this state, the assembly unit of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Thus, the trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is inserted and stayed in the pierce hole of abdominal wall H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> With the above structure, the following advantages can be obtained. The trocar system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes the soft cylindrical guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> projected from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> that is interposed between the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the ultrasonic trocar. Thus, when the small-diameter pierce hole made by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is to be enlarged up to the outside diameter of the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> by the conical portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> can be put in contact with the organ in the abdominal cavity before the distal end portion of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the organ in the abdominal cavity. Accordingly, during the dilation operation, the distal end portion of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is surely prevented from coming in contact with the organ in the abdominal cavity, and the safety in the dilation operation is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> While the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is being held by the fingers, the operation of axially pulling the handle section <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> relative to the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the operation of pushing it out are properly combined. Thereby, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which projects from the distal end of the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, can be desirably adjusted. Accordingly, the amount of projection of the distal end portion of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> can be desirably adjusted in accordance with conditions such as the thickness of the abdominal wall H that is to be pierced by the trocar tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, or the distance from the organ. As a result, the organ in the abdominal cavity will never be pressed during the dilation operation for increasing the diameter of the small-diameter pierce hole made in the abdominal wall H by the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> up to the outside diameter of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the work for inserting and staying the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in the abdominal wall H can be carried out easily and quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The straight breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is provided at the distal conical end portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a lateral force acts on the soft guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> projecting from the distal end of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the force acting in such a direction as to bend the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> at the distal conical portion of the pierce hole expansion hole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be dispersed over the wide area of the straight breakage-prevention section <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the conical distal portion of the pierce hole expansion portion <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is prevented from exerting a large local bending force to the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, and the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is protected against bending. During the dilation operation, the breakage-prevention portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be made to function also as the guide member for the dilation work. Thus, the operability of the dilation work of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>A, the guide member lock mechanism <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> engages the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the locked state in which the engagement claw <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> of lock member <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> engages the first engagement groove <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Thus, the relative position of the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is fixed at the set position. As a result, when the needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is made to pierce the patient&apos;s body wall, the proximal end portion of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is never disengaged from the proximal end portion of the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Unlike the prior art, the operation of the trocar does not become unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the position of the distal end of trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> projecting from the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> can be adjusted, before insertion in the body wall, by the position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The amount of insertion of the distal end portion of the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is adjusted, as desired, in accordance with conditions such as the thickness of the body wall for piercing or the location of piercing. Compared to the prior art, the needle can be made to pierce the patient&apos;s body wall more efficiently in a shorter time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>A, the lock button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of position adjusting mechanism <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is disposed opposed to the operation handle <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (at an angular distance of 180&deg;) with respect to the center axis of the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Thus, the lock button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is easy to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows a seventh embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is made by altering the structure of the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the sixth embodiment (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in the following fashion. Except for the altered portions, the handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has the same structure as that in the sixth embodiment and a description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in this embodiment, the tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> has an insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> having a relatively small diameter (e.g. about 5 mm) and a short length. The inside diameter of the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is set to be substantially equal to, for example, the outside diameter of the straight portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the dilator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the sixth embodiment is omitted. The straight portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is directly inserted in the insertion portion <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the guide member lock mechanism <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of handpiece unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> engages the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the locked state in which the engagement claw <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> of lock member <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> engages the first engagement groove <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Thus, the relative position of the guide member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is fixed at the set position. As a result, when the needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is made to pierce the patient&apos;s body wall, the proximal end portion of tube <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is never disengaged from the proximal end portion of the trocar needle <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Unlike the prior art, the operation of the trocar does not become unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> as a first modification of the guide member lock mechanism <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of the sixth embodiment, a fixing screw member <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> can detachably be engaged in the second engagement groove <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> in the outer periphery of the small-diameter cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference> as a second modification, a lock mechanism using an operation lever <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Needless to say, other modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The present invention can provide a trocar and a trocar system wherein a tube for piercing in a patient&apos;s body can be easily and quickly inserted and stayed in the patient&apos;s skin and body wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
