<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for supporting a voltage in an output driver circuit and smoothing the response of the voltage to switching operations in the output driver circuit. A capacitive element, such as a capacitor or transistor, is coupled to the gate of a drive transistor in an output driver leg circuit of an output driver and to a switched signal voltage. By coupling the capacitive element to a signal voltage other than ground, a smaller capacitive element is required than that required for coupling the capacitive element to ground. An embodiment of the invention further includes a plurality of capacitive elements configured such that the voltage support is applied to the gate of the drive transistor in phases rather than all at once to smooth voltage response to drive transistor switching. Transistors having relatively longer effective channel lengths may be used as the capacitive elements to allow for additional phasing-in of the voltage support due to signal delay through the longer channels. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to voltage compensation techniques in an output driver for an integrated circuit. More particularly, the present invention relates to coupling a capacitive element between a drive transistor&apos;s gate and a power supply and phasing-in portions of a voltage-supporting capacitance at slightly different times to smooth the compensating corrections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As the sizes of semiconductor devices have reduced, so have the power supply voltages driving the devices. With smaller power supply voltages, respective signals within the semiconductor devices have also become smaller and more susceptible to variance caused by the influence of resistance, inductance, capacitance and switching within the semiconductor device. Unintended variances on a signal line can lead to an inability to correctly detect a signal and to detecting a signal when one was not intended. In either case, malfunctions and other signal errors may occur as a result of the variances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an output <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor device conventionally includes an output driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between the primary semiconductor circuitry <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outputs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. One purpose of the output driver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is to provide sufficient power compensation for the output signal to ensure the signal is output with an appropriate signal strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a conventional output driver circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. For a conventional semiconductor die, each output of the die is coupled to each of constant voltage signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; through envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Each of the constant voltage signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; through envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is further coupled to at least one output driver leg circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Using one of the output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> coupled to envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as an example, each output driver leg circuit conventionally includes a drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a switching transistor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The output driver circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is configured as an open-drain output driver. An open-drain configured output driver is one in which the drain of the drive transistor for each output driver leg circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is not coupled to circuitry within the semiconductor, but is directly coupled to an externally accessible contact, such as a bond pad. In a conventional open-drain configured output driver circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that has its output impedance controlled, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will have its gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> set to a controlled voltage (typically 1.3 V to 1.4 V) such that the drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will be in saturation as much as possible while still achieving the required output drive. The switching transistor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is placed between the drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a reference potential <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> such as a ground, to allow for switching the drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> between off and on states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The array of output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are conventionally configured such that the transistors used for the output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> coupled to constant voltage signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are approximately half the physical size of the transistors used for the output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> coupled to constant voltage signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the transistors used for the output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> coupled to envg&lt;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are approximately half the physical size of the transistors used for the output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> coupled to constant voltage signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This pattern of using transistors approximately half the physical size of the transistors coupled to the next sequential envg&lt; &gt; signal line continues down to the transistors coupled to envg&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The physical size of the output driver leg circuit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is half the sum of the physical sizes of both output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The output drive supplied by an output driver leg circuit is proportional to the physical size of the transistors used for that output driver leg circuit. By including output driver leg circuits, each providing a different output drive amount, a combination of different output driver leg circuits can provide a wide range of available output drive. Additional circuitry well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art determines how much output drive is needed for a particular output signal and controls which output driver leg circuits are switched &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; to provide an appropriate level of output drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Though there are many advantages to selectively switching the various output driver leg circuits <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF,&rdquo; the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; action causes undesirable shifts in the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> voltage due to potential changes that couple back through the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Namely, the drive transistor&apos;s gate voltage may drop 100 mV from its desired level, for example, when the drive transistor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is switched to an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; state which will reduce the output drive from its intended target. One method of compensating for this drop in voltage, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is to couple a capacitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a ground potential. With the capacitor in place, when the drive transistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;ON&rdquo; indirectly by the switching transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the voltage on the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> begins to drop toward a ground potential, but the capacitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, also referenced to the ground potential, reduces the voltage drop experienced. The larger the capacitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> used, the smaller the voltage dip caused when the drive transistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is turned on. One example of a support circuit having capacitive support of this kind used in an output driver circuit may be found in Rambus Dynamic Random Access Memory (RDRAM) part 288MD-400-800, designed by Rambus, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The repeated &ldquo;ON&rdquo;-&ldquo;OFF&rdquo; action, with the voltage on the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> working to remain constant over a period of time, results in a square wave signal at the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The output driver leg circuits&apos; control circuit then tries to set the DC average of the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> voltage equal to the desired voltage. As an example, using the output driver leg circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if constant voltage signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> were set at an operating voltage of 1.4 V and the switching transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> were turned on, the voltage on the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> would initially tend to be pulled down by the voltage on the drain of the switching transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, perhaps to 1.3 V. The capacitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the drive transistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would then tend to reduce the voltage drop experienced. If the switching transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> were turned &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and never turned &ldquo;OFF,&rdquo; the voltage on the gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the drive transistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would eventually reattain 1.4 V due to the controlling circuit&apos;s effect. For a typical output driver compensation circuit, however, the switching transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is not left &ldquo;ON,&rdquo; but is repeatedly switched &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF.&rdquo; This toggling &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; results in a square wave signal on constant voltage signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which eventually reaches a DC average of 1.4 V, toggling, for example, between 1.35 V and 1.45 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These variances in the voltage level of constant voltage signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> result in variances in the output signal power which can result in signal transmission errors. As a result, part specifications are used to identify the maximum allowable variance for reliable operation. For example, the specifications for the RDRAM 288MD-40-800, referenced previously, require that the voltage level on the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> have less than a 50 mV variance. To reduce the variance of the drive transistor&apos;s gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> voltage to less than 50 mV requires a substantial capacitor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (approximately 15 times the physical size of the associated drive transistor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) coupled to each envg&lt; &gt; signal line. Where semiconductor space or &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; is precious, such a large capacitor for each output consumes a significant portion of the space available. It is therefore desirable to have an output drive circuit with minimal voltage variance without using such a large capacitor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an output driver circuit for a semiconductor device, the output driver circuit including a plurality of compensating circuits which are capable of maintaining minimal variance in the drive transistor gate voltages without the use of excessively large capacitors. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a capacitor is coupled to the gate of a drive transistor and to a signal voltage. This signal voltage is established such that it opposes the voltage shift caused by switching the switching transistor &ldquo;ON.&rdquo; By referencing the compensating capacitor to such a signal voltage, smaller capacitor sizes are needed to obtain the results offered by large capacitors referenced to ground. An additional capacitor may also be referenced to ground to provide additional compensation during the transitions of the switching transistor and the signal voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, the voltage compensation provided to the gate of the drive transistor is added in phases, one portion at a time, to smooth out the response to the compensation correction. In one embodiment, rather than applying the compensation all at once, the compensation is added in two portions or phases. In another embodiment, the compensation is added in three phases. In yet another embodiment, the compensation is further supplemented with an additional capacitor referenced to a ground potential. In yet another embodiment, transistors having relatively long effective channel lengths are used to cause a delayed compensation to provide a fourth phase of compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, existing output drivers are reworked to meet application specifications by reconnecting existing transistors within the semiconductor die to enable narrower specification parameters without large capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An electronic system is disclosed comprising a processor, a memory device, an input, an output and a storage device, at least one of which includes an output driver circuit with a compensating circuit having at least one capacitor coupled between the gate of a drive transistor and a signal voltage. A semiconductor wafer is also disclosed including an output driver circuit according to one or more embodiments of the present invention.</paragraph>

By coupling a capacitor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> between the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, a significantly smaller capacitance is required to support the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> voltage against being pulled down by the switching transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> being turned &ldquo;ON.&rdquo; In operation, as the signal voltage q is provided on signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to switch &ldquo;ON&rdquo; the switching transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and, thus, activate the drive transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the charge stored on the capacitor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> pushes up against the voltage on signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as the connection to ground through the switching transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> pulls down on the voltage on signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> through the drive transistor&apos;s <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a compensating circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of an output driver circuit according to a second embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> support circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is placed between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> used to turn &ldquo;ON&rdquo; the switching transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to initiate the drive transistor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, however, the support circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> comprises two transistors <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to apply the voltage support in two separate phases rather than all at once. In operation, when the signal voltage q is provided on the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to switch on the switching transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and, thus, activate the drive transistor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the initial phase of the support is provided to the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through the transistor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> directly coupled between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The second phase of the support is provided to the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through the p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> coupled between the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the transistor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> coupled directly to the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Because of the phasing delays in compensation caused by placing a p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the transistor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the compensation through that leg of the support circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is slower than with the first phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One factor affecting the response of the voltage level on the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the added support, and to the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being pulled toward ground by the switching transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> turning &ldquo;ON,&rdquo; is that there is a delay in the voltage on the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> being pulled down from the time the signal voltage q is applied to the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. If too much support is applied to the signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> before the voltage has been fully affected by the switching of the switching transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be over-supported, causing more variance in the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> voltage. Applying support to the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in phases rather than all at once allows for a smoother response to the added support and, thus, a more steady voltage level on the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a compensating circuit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of an output driver circuit according to a third embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> support circuit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is placed between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, a first signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> used to turn on the switching transistor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to initiate the drive transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a second signal voltage (qL) line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, however, the support circuit <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> comprises three transistors <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to apply the support in three separate phases rather than all at once. For this embodiment, a signal voltage q is applied to the first signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and a signal voltage qL is applied to the second signal voltage (qL) line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The first phase of support is provided through the transistor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> coupled directly to both the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the first signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The second phase of support is provided through the transistor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> coupled directly to both the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the second signal voltage (qL) line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The third phase of support is provided through the p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the transistor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> coupled between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the first signal voltage (q) line <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Additionally, as shown with respect to a fourth embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> capacitive element in the form of a transistor <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> may also be added between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and a ground reference to provide support for the voltage on that signal line to further enhance the support provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As will be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from the embodiments shown thus far, any number of support phases may be used to support the voltage on a signal line in different phasing steps rather than all at once. By supporting the voltage on the envg&lt; &gt; signal line in phasing steps, the response of the voltage level to switching on the switching transistor is smoother and less likely to spike or dip. Furthermore, by placing at least a portion of the supporting elements between the signal line and a reference voltage, smaller capacitances are required than when coupling the supporting elements to ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention, which provides another phasing dimension to the phases previously described herein, is selection of the effective channel length of the capacitors or transistors used to support the envg&lt; &gt; signal lines. The effective channel length of the capacitors and transistors used to support the envg&lt; &gt; signal lines impacts the smoothness of the compensating corrections. For example, the shorter the effective channel length of a transistor or capacitor, the faster compensation at one end of the channel affects the voltage at the other end of the channel. Conversely, the longer the effective channel length of the transistor or capacitor, the slower compensation at one end of the channel affects the voltage at the other end. By determining, through simulation and/or experiment, the capacitive support and timing required to best and most smoothly support the voltage on the signal lines envg&lt; &gt;, an appropriate effective channel length may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The surrounding circuitry and particular semiconductor material used will affect the timing and support needed for a given application. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to make the needed calculations for a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As will also be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art, one or more embodiments of supporting circuitry may be included on each output driver leg circuit of an output driver circuit, or it may be preferable in some applications to include no forms of supporting circuitry on a particular output driver leg circuit. For example, because the output driver leg circuit transistors become respectively smaller in physical size, by half, than the preceding transistor in a series of output driver leg circuits, the voltage support added by each of these circuit transistors similarly becomes respectively smaller. Because the physically smaller transistors have, respectively, a smaller effect on the overall voltage when they are switched in as support, phase compensation of smaller transistor support may not be necessary or desired in a particular application. As with determining the timing required for adequate support of the voltage on the voltage (q) signal lines, which support circuits need phased support configurations may readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. If multiple phases of compensation are not needed, one or more capacitive elements coupled between the signal line envg&lt; &gt; and a grounded reference is sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention may also be incorporated into existing output driver circuits. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the present invention wherein existing circuitry on a semiconductor die was modified to meet a higher standard of voltage maintenance on the signal lines envg&lt; &gt;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an output driver circuit compensating array <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is provided having a plurality of signal lines envg&lt;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; through envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>.

To improve the ability of the compensating array <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to control and smooth the voltage response on each envg&lt; &gt; signal line to switching &ldquo;ON&rdquo; driving transistors, support circuitry <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> was added.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The existing array of transistors <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has been modified, in this example, to provide two primary phases of support in addition to the support provided by the capacitive element <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> coupled between signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and ground.

The second support circuitry <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a second transistor array with a plurality of transistors <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and is modified to provide phased support to the voltage of signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the second transistor array <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>: a first transistor <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is coupled between signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and ground; a second transistor <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and a fourth transistor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> have their gates grounded so as to be ineffective; a third transistor is coupled between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the drain of the p-channel <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and the first signal voltage (q) signal line <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>; and a fifth transistor <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is coupled between the signal line envg&lt;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&gt; <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and voltage (qL) signal line <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>.
