<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to conveyor systems and, more particularly, to a modular roller conveyor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are many previously known roller conveyor systems of the type used in industrial manufacturing operations. These previously known roller conveyor systems typically comprise an elongated frame having a pair of spaced apart and parallel rails. A plurality of roller assemblies are then disposed across the rails and spaced apart from each other thus forming the conveyor path upon which articles to be conveyed are supported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A primary disadvantage of this type of previously known industrial roller conveyor system is that each roller conveyor system has been custom designed and manufactured in dependence upon the particular type and size of article to be conveyed along the conveyor system. As such, the spacing between the rails or conveyor width, and thus the design of the conveyor frame, varies as a function of the size of the conveyed article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While these previously known conveyor systems have proven satisfactory in operation, they are necessarily expensive to manufacture. This high cost of manufacturing such previously known roller conveyor systems results in large part from the necessity that each roller conveyor system must be custom designed in accordance with the load conveyed. Such custom design of these previously known roller conveyor systems necessarily entails increased engineering costs and highly skilled, and thus highly paid, assembly workers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A still further disadvantage of these previously known roller conveyor systems is that, since each roller conveyor system is custom designed for a predetermined article, the roller conveyor system cannot be adapted for articles of different sizes, at least not articles of a larger size. This in turn results in premature obsolescence of the roller conveyor system when conveyance of the article for which the roller conveyor system was originally designed for is no longer required. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a modular roller conveyor system which overcomes all of the above-mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In brief, the roller conveyor system of the present invention comprises a first pair of elongated vertical supports. These vertical supports are adjustably secured together so that the first pair of vertical supports are spaced apart and parallel to each other. However, unlike the previously known conveyor systems, the spacing between the first pair of vertical supports is adjustable to any selected user defined spacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the conveyor system further comprises a second pair of elongated vertical supports. This second pair of elongated vertical supports is also adjustably secured together at the same user selected spacing as the first pair of vertical supports and so that the second pair of vertical supports are spaced apart and parallel to each other. The first pair of vertical supports and second pair of vertical supports are then positioned in a spaced apart relationship relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A first elongated rail is then secured to an upper end of one of the first pair of vertical supports and to an upper end of one of the second pair of vertical supports. Similarly, a second elongated rail is secured to the upper end of the other of the first pair of the vertical supports and to the upper end of the other of the second pair of vertical supports so that the first and second rails are spaced apart and parallel to each other. A plurality of roller assemblies are then disposed between and supported by the rails so that the roller assemblies are spaced apart and parallel to each other. These roller assemblies thus define the path of the conveyor system and support the articles which are to be conveyed by the roller conveyor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Unlike the previously known roller conveyor systems, since the vertical supports in both the first pair of vertical supports and second pair of vertical supports are secured together at a user selected spacing, the width of the roller conveyor system can be easily varied to accommodate articles of different widths. Furthermore, the spacing between the rails may be easily modified at a subsequent date by merely adjusting the spacing between the first pair of vertical supports and second pair of vertical supports. In this event, relatively inexpensive replacement of the roller assemblies to accommodate the new conveyor width may be required.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> preferred embodiment of the roller conveyor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is there shown and comprises a first pair of elongated vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second pair of elongated vertical supports <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The first pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are spaced from the second pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A first elongated rail <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed along and supported by an upper end of the vertical supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a second elongated rail <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is secured to and supported by an upper end of the other vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are spaced apart and parallel to each other. Preferably, the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are manufactured in preset modular lengths, such as ten foot or twelve foot lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> plurality of roller assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed between and supported by the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the roller assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are spaced apart and parallel to each other. These roller assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, furthermore, define the conveyor path for the conveyor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are adapted to support a bottom of a load <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> conveyed by the conveyor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the first pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are there shown in greater detail. The first pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, moreover, are substantially identical to the second pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Consequently, only the first pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be described in detail, it being understood that a like description shall also apply to the second pair of vertical supports <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are each substantially identical to each other and comprise an elongated square tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having an upper end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A foot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is secured to the lower end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by any conventional means, such as by welds <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or alternatively by fasteners <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The foot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is adapted to rest upon a ground support surface and thus support both the vertical support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as well as the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the vertical support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably includes a threaded shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to vary the vertical position of the square tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to the foot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> prior to securing the foot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the square tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The height adjustment provided by the threaded shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, however, is purely optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A bracket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is secured to the upper end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This bracket <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes a number of mounting holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which are adapted to register with like mounting holes in the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are then used to secure the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the upright supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a side bracket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is secured to and extends laterally outwardly from each tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Preferably, these side brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are secured to their associated tubes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by welding. Furthermore, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the side brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> lie in a plane that is offset from a center line of the tubes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that each bracket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is aligned with one side <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of its associated tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An elongated channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> having at least one and preferably a plurality of longitudinally extending slots <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is disposed between the side brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. One or more fasteners <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, e.g. T bolts, extend through registering openings in the side bracket <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so that one end of each fastener <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is slidably positioned within one slot <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Since the fasteners <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are slidably positioned within one slot <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the spacing between the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be varied to any user selected spacing between the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as illustrated in phantom line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Upon tightening of the fasteners <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, however, the side brackets <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are rigidly secured to the channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and thus rigidly secured to each other. However, at a subsequent time, the spacing between the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be adjusted by loosening the fastener <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, repositioning the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and then subsequently retightening the fasteners <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> preferably has the same width as the width of the tubes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, since the side brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are aligned with one side <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, upon tightening of the side brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to opposite sides of the channel member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, any skewing of the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to each other is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, for a very narrow width conveyor, the brackets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be secured together without an intervening channel member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure modular construction of the vertical supports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as well as the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as well as the support brackets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, are preferably formed by laser cutting. Such laser cutting ensures that the fastener openings in the support brackets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will register with the corresponding fastener openings in the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in order to rotatably drive the roller assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a generally L-shaped motor mounting plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> having a short side <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a long side <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is mounted to and beneath the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A rotary drive motor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is secured to the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and is drivingly connected to the roller assemblies <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in any conventional fashion, such as by a drive chain <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order to secure the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an elongated rod <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extends through and is supported by blocks <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which are secured to the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This rod <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, furthermore, supports the short side <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to support the long side <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a first bracket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is secured to one end of the side <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> while a second bracket <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is adjustably secured in any conventional fashion to the side <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at a position spaced from the first bracket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. These brackets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> register with openings in the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in order to secure the side <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The attachment of the motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by the rod <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be of adjustable length to accommodate varying widths between the conveyor rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as well as the adjustable bracket <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, enables the same motor mount plate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to be utilized with the conveyor system regardless of the spacing between the rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention provides a modular roller conveyor system in which the width between the rails which support the roller assemblies may be easily adjusted to any user selected spacing to accommodate articles of different widths. Furthermore, the spacing between the conveyor rails <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be varied at a subsequent time to accommodate a different load having a different width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Having described my invention, however, many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.</paragraph>
