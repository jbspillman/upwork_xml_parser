<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an operation and maintenance planning aiding system for a power generation installation, and, in particular, relates to an operation and maintenance planning aiding system for a power generation installation, in which a service center is provided which manages operation and maintenance of a plurality of power generation units and prepares an operation and maintenance plan for respective power generation units by making use of plant data obtained from the respective power generation units through a communication network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Conventional Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, many electric power generation companies, which operate electric power generation business, hold a plurality of power generation units, and, in order to manage the power generation amount of these power generation units as a whole, comprise respective power generation systems provided with a power supply command center (central supply) for every electric power generation company. In such power generation system the power supply command center assigns and adjusts the power generation amount for every power generation unit in response to power demand from consumers and each of the power generation units performs an operation while maintaining and adjusting the power generation amount assigned by the power supply command center. In such instance, the power supply command center prepares, in view of enhancing economy, an operation plan of the concerned power generation system so as to minimize fuel cost used in the power generation units, in that so as to maximize power generation efficiency as well as prepares, in view of putting priority on environment protection, so as to keep the exhaust gas amount such nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides exhausted from the power generation units within an allowable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Now, the characteristics with regard to the power efficiency and the exhaust gas amount which are used as references for the operation planning vary greatly depending on kinds of fuel used and power generation methods. With regard to fuels, in case of a thermal power generation many kinds of fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas can be used, therefore, depending on the kind of fuels used, not only the power generation amount per unit fuel cost but also the amount and contents of the exhaust gas vary greatly. Further, with regard to power generation methods, the constitutions of machines and apparatuses of themselves such as power generation by a steam turbine, power generation by a gas turbine and a combined power generation combining thereof affect greatly to their power generation efficiency. The power supply command center stores and preserves plant data (data representing the plant characteristics) obtained from these power generation units for every power generation unit, and uses these plant data when preparing operation plans for respective power generation units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the above referred to conventional power generation system, although the power supply command center stores and preserves the plant data for every power generation unit, these plant data were limited to the plant data at comparatively early stage of the respective power generation units such as design values and those at the operation starting period of the power generation plants, however, these plant data vary gradually depending on passage of time as well as the contents of fuel used also vary, therefore, it was difficult to prepare operation plans based on the current plant characteristics of the respective power generation units if only by making use of these plant data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, the above referred to conventional power generation system, since the machines and apparatuses such as a gas turbine constituting the power generating unit are always exposed to a high temperature, if load variation to the machines and apparatuses is frequently and repeatedly caused, deterioration of the machines and apparatuses due to thermal fatigue rapidly advances. For this reason, even if a fully economic operation which simply minimizes fuel cost for respective power generation units is employed, when the load variation to the machines and apparatuses is repeated, the life time of the machines and apparatuses is shortened to quicken exchange time thereof, the total cost for the respective power generation units necessary for the plant operation including the maintenance cost is not necessarily minimized. Further, in the above referred to conventional power generation system, even if a plurality of power generation units having a high power generation efficiency are positively selected for the operation, when a provability of failure of the machines and apparatuses and the parts thereof constituting the power generation unit concerned is high, an unplanned outage is caused by a failure occurrence in the machines and apparatuses and the parts thereof which possibly causes an economic loss, therefore, even when an operation plan for a plurality of power generation units is prepared only based on fuel cost, the resultant cost was not necessarily minimized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the power generation unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, when the process value transmission unit <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> transmits process data which is transferred via the communication network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the side of the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtains via the fire wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the process data, transfers the obtained process data from the process value receiving unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the process value data base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and stores the same therein. Further, other process data transferred from other power generation units <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are likely stored in the process value data base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Herein, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents in the process value data base as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and shows a structure of the process data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each of the process data is assigned of a process number representing ID for discriminating process value for every power generation unit and is managed according to the process number. In the present embodiment, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtains process data in a predetermined cycle from the respective power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and in the present first embodiment as will be seen from the contents with regard to time of the process data stored in the process value data base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtains the process data in a cycle of 1 sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The power supply command center <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits a power demand amount required to be supplied by the electric power generation company <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a power demand information to the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the communication network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Since the power demand information varies time to time depending on power demand, the information is transmitted in a predetermined cycle, for example, every 1 sec. to the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the power demand information via the fire wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at the power demand amount receiving unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and supplies the received power demand information to the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> distributes power generation amounts for the respective power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that the summed value of the power generation amounts of the respective power generation unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> coincides with the required value, and supplies the distribution result to the operation plan information transmitting unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The operation plan information transmitting unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> transmits the operation plan information, namely the power generation amount information distributed to the respective power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the power supply command center <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the communication network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The power supply command center <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> confirms the contents of the operation plan information sent from the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the command values of the power generation amount for the respective power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> according to the operation plan information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The explanation until now relates to the operation planning in response to power demand which varies time to time in the operation and maintenance planning aiding system for a power generation installation, however, other than the above, the present operation and maintenance planning aiding system for a power generation installation also prepares a long term operation plan. For example, the system prepares such maintenance plans in which, based on the plant data obtained through on-line, conditions of the machine and apparatus and the parts thereof in the power generation units are judged and such as disassembling and inspection of the power generation units and exchanging of the parts thereof are performed according to the judgement result, and timing of the periodical inspection of the power generation units is adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The above is an outline of the service which the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provides to the electric power generation company <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, details of processing steps performed by the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for preparing the operation and maintenance plan will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses power generation efficiency in the respective power generation units as one of parameters for preparing the operation plan. Hereinbelow, the processing for calculating the power generation efficiency will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the evaluation of the power generation efficiency is performed at the efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, which investigates models of the machine and apparatus constituting the power generation unit with reference to the design information data base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a view for explaining the storage contents of the design information data base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and shows the structure of the design information data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the design information data are constituted by machines and apparatus and parts thereof constituting the respective power generation units and their supplying manufacturers and types for every machine, apparatus and part. For example, in the case of a first power generation unit (power generation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in power plant A, a product of A company of type GT001 is employed as a gas turbine, and as parts constituting the gas turbine, a combustor of B company of type CB003, a turbine of A company of type TB001 and a compressor of A company of type CP001 are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Further, the efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> refers to a machine and apparatus model in the machine and apparatus model data base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to calculate the power generation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a view for explaining the storage contents in the machine and apparatus model data base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and shows the structure of the machine and apparatus data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the machine and apparatus model data are constituted by parts or types and machine and apparatus model for every part and type, and the substance of the machine and apparatus model is a program operable on a computer. Further, each of the machine and apparatus model data is provided with a process number for the process value serving as an input and output of the program for every machine and apparatus model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> causes to operate the program according to the input and output specification stored in the machine and apparatus model data base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Now, processing steps which perform the efficiency diagnosis by making use of the machine and apparatus model will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a view for explaining an outline constitution of a gas turbine. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7 a</cross-reference> gas turbine is constituted by a compressor, a combustor and a turbine and between these elements air, combustion gas or fuel flows. For example, when the machine and apparatus model as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is constituted by a combination of machine and apparatus models of the compressor, combustor and turbine stored in the machine and apparatus model data base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a performance of the gas turbine as a whole can be calculated by calculating the performances of the respective machine and apparatus models. Namely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when measured values such as fuel, shaft rpm, flow rate of intake air and temperature are set at the inputs of the machine and apparatus model, such as electrical power output and exhaust gas temperature to be output under the set conditions can be estimated. The calculation is performed under the precondition that the respective machine and apparatus models are operated normally. Therefore, when a deviation is caused between the estimated value determined by making use of machine and apparatus models and the actually measured value obtained from the plant data, it can be judged that the power generation unit generating such plant data is deviating from a normal condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a characteristic diagram showing a secular change of an electric power output between estimated value using a machine and apparatus model and actually measured value obtained from a power generation unit, and the ordinate represents electrical power output and the abscissa represents time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at the early stage the estimated value and the actually measured value substantially coincide, however, depending on time passage the deviation value between the estimated value and the actually measured value increases, which implies that deterioration of the gas turbine in the concerned power generation unit advances to decrease the performance thereof and no output according to one designed can be obtained anymore from the concerned power generation unit. In the present example, total performance of the gas turbine has been calculated, however, performance of the individual machines such as compressor, combustor and turbine can be calculated for the evaluation. In such instance, a part of which performance is decreasing can be specified which is effective for identifying the causes of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> converts the performance calculation result determined by means of the machine and apparatus models into power generation cost and compares the same with the power generation cost determined from the actual measurement value from the plant data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a characteristic diagram showing an analysis example of efficiency diagnosis performed in an efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>; and the ordinate represents power generation cost and the abscissa represents output wherein evaluation of the estimated value by means of the machine and apparatus models and evaluation of the actually measured value obtained from the plant data are shown in comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the power generation cost is defined as a fuel cost necessary for outputting a unit power generation amount and the fuel cost is determined in a predetermined time internal (for example, every one hour). Further, in the evaluation based on the actually measured value in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> the power generation cost is calculated by making use of the electrical power output and fuel flow rate stored in the process value data base <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the fuel cost obtained in advance, in that the power generation cost is calculated by multiplying the fuel cost to the fuel flow rate and by dividing the multiplied result with the electric power output. On the other hand, in the evaluation based on the estimated value by means of the machine and apparatus models in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the power generation cost is determined by making use of the fuel flow rate of actually measured value and the electrical power output of the estimated value by means of the machine and apparatus models. When plotting the respective power generation costs determined according to the both methods for every load, and if the performances of the machines and apparatuses are those of as designed, the two plotted lines will coincide. The example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a case where the power generation cost increases due to performance deterioration of machines and apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the preparation of the operation and maintenance plan by making use of the power generation cost calculated in the efficiency diagnosis unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is performed in the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Hereinbelow, the processing performed in the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> uses the power generation costs determined in on-line of the respective power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and prepares a plan from economic point of view so as to positively operate a power generation unit or units having a lower power generation cost among the power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. For example, in the power generation unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> among the power generation units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, if deterioration of, for example, the gas turbine among its constituting machines and apparatus advances and the efficiency thereof decreases, a deviation is caused between the power generation cost based on the actually measured value determined from the process data in the power generation unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the power generation cost determined from the estimation value by means of the machine and apparatus models as explained above. In such instance, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> evaluates the economic loss due to the performance deterioration according to the following equation (1); </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>1&equals;<highlight><italic>C&times;A&times;D</italic></highlight>1&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> wherein, L1: Economic loss due to performance deterioration (&yen;) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> C: Power generation cost increase component due to the performance deterioration (&yen;/MWd) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A: Power generation amount (actual resultant value) per day (MWd/day) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> D1: Remaining days until subsequent periodic inspection (days). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the equation (1), the power generation amount A per day is determined by averaging the cumulative electric power output amount in respective operation days. When multiplying the power generation amount A per day with the remaining days D1 until the periodic inspection, an estimated possible power generation amount until the periodic inspection can be calculated. Information with regard to a plan on the periodic inspection is stored in the periodic inspection information data base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents of a periodic inspection data base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and shows a structure of the periodic inspection information data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the periodic inspection information data are information representing periodic inspection time already performed in the past and periodic inspection time to be performed in the future, and based on the periodic inspection information data the remaining days until the subsequent periodical inspection is calculated. The economic loss (L1) due to performance deterioration can be calculated by multiplying the estimated power generation amount (A&times;D1) until the subsequent periodic inspection by the power generation cost increase component (C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> judges, in view of the total cost incurred for the operation and maintenance, whether operation of one power generation unit, for example, the power generation unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has to be stopped and the machines and apparatuses and the parts thereof have to be exchanged or the operation thereof has to be continued under the performance deteriorating condition. In this instance, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> calculates the cost in association with the change of the machines and apparatuses or the parts thereof with reference to the machine and apparatus information data base <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents of a machine and apparatus data base <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and shows a structure of the machine and apparatus information data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the machine and apparatus information data are constituted by manufacturer and type, purchased price and days necessary for installation work for every machine and apparatus and part thereof. In this instance, the cost in association with the exchange of the machines and apparatuses and the parts thereof is a sum of the current price of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof in view of depreciation and the loss of electric power sales opportunity because of the power generation stopping due to the exchange work, and is expressed by the following equation (2); </paragraph>

The depreciation is evaluated in view of the remaining life time and uses the already consumed life time (R) as a parameter therefor. The consumed life time value (R) is a normalized value, and under a brand-new condition when beginning the use, the value is 0 and the value increases depending on the use years and becomes to 1 when the exchange level has been reached. Namely, the consumed life time value (R) of 1 implies that the concerned machine and apparatus has been used up and no value remains there. A calculation method of the consumed life time value (R) will be explained later. Further, with regard to the loss of electric power sales opportunity, the power generation amount not generated because of exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof can be calculated by multiplying the power generation amount (A) per day by the days (D2) required for installation work stored in the machine and apparatus information data base <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and when the electric power sales price (E) is multiplied by the above calculated non-power generation amount, the economic loss in association with the exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof can be calculated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The parts such as gas turbine which are subjected to a high temperature during the operation thereof are caused of thermal fatigue damage induced by thermal stress variation in association with the applied temperature as well as caused of creep damage which advances depending on the height of the applied temperature and duration time thereof. These damages induces damages such as cracks if a predetermined critical value is exceeded and causes to a significant accident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the remaining life time evaluation data are constituted by graphs representing accumulation of the thermal fatigue damage and the creep damage in the respective power generation unit (gas turbine). In the graph of the thermal fatigue damage, the ordinate represents normalized thermal fatigue value, and the abscissa represents accumulation value of exhaust gas temperature variation rate for every 10 sec., and it is defined that when the thermal fatigue damage value reaches to 1, it is determined the material endurance with respect to the thermal fatigue damage has reached to the critical value. Namely, the accumulation value of the exhaust gas temperature variation rate in the gas turbine is a value obtained in such a manner that after the absolute value difference between the current exhaust gas temperature value and that of before 10 sec. (representing variation rate in 10 sec.) is multiplied by a normalized constant and the multiplication results are added for every 10 sec., therefore, the thermal fatigue damage value simply increases depending on lapse of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Further, in the graph representing the creep damage, the ordinate represents normalized creep damage value, the abscissa represents accumulated value of exhaust gas temperature for every 10 sec., and when the creep damage value reaches to 1, the material endurance with regard to the creep damage reaches to a critical value. The creep damage value simply increases depending on lapse of time. The consumed life time of a gas turbine is determined by the sum of the thermal fatigue damage value and the creep damage value by taking into account of both influences by the thermal fatigue damage and by the creep damage.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The consumed life time value of a brand-new gas turbine at the time of installation is 0 and the value gradually increases through repetition of such operations including temperature variation as starting up/stopping and load adjustment in addition to a usual operation. In order to evaluate the remaining life time of a gas turbine, based on the consumed life time until now, a possible consumed life time thereafter is extrapolated and estimated according to the mathematical formula representing the consumed life time value, and the remaining life time is determined by the remaining time until the estimated result reaches to the consumed life time value of 1 representing the exchange level. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> determines the days until the subsequent periodic inspection for the concerned power generation unit with reference to the periodic inspection information data base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and judges whether the calculated remaining life time days are larger or shorter than the determined days until the subsequent periodic inspection. Then, if it is judged that the remaining life time days are longer than the days until the subsequent periodic inspection (Y), the process moves to the next step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, if it is judged that the remaining life time days are shorter than the days until the subsequent periodic inspection (N), the process moves to the next step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan for the concerned power generation unit to perform a usual operation and ends the series of processings in the flow chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Further, in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> reduces the maximum power generation amount in the concerned power generation unit by 25% and sets the same at 75% of the current power generation mount, and further reduces the load adjustment amount which varies depending on the power demand by 25% and sets the same at 75% of the current load adjustment amount, and prepares an operation plan which intends to prolong the remaining life time of the concerned power generation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> judges whether or not the maximum power generation amount in the concerned power generation unit has been reduced by 100%. Then, if it is judged that the maximum power generation amount has been reduced by 100% (Y), the process moves to the subsequent step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, it is judged that the maximum power generation amount has not yet been reduced by 100% (N), the process moves to another step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> repeats the process in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> four times which will be explained later, even through repeating the processings if the end of the life time is reached, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan to stop the operation of the concerned power generation unit and ends the series of processings in the flow chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Further, in step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan which permits to continue the operation of the concerned power generation unit for a week. Then, after a week when completing the operation plan, the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> again causes to repeat steps following step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In parallel with the above operation plan, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan in which another power generation unit having a higher power generation efficiency is positively selected for operation based on the power generation efficiency of the respective power generation units calculated in on-line. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the power generation amount (output) of a power generation unit is reduced, a reduction of the power generation efficiency is caused (in other words cost increase) regardless to the performance deterioration due to abnormality. For this reason, a probability of continuing operation of the power generation unit is reduced of which power generation amount is adjusted to be reduced based on the remaining life time. Then, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares a maintenance plan for performing exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof for the power generation unit of which operation is judged to be stopped according to the remaining life time diagnosis result for the respective power generation units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The above explanation shows an example in which, when preparing an operation and maintenance plan for power generation units by making use of the remaining life time data, deterioration of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof advances more than that estimated and the exchange timing is hastened. When preparing a usual operation and maintenance plan for power generation units it is planned based on the remaining life time data to exchange the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof at the time of the periodic inspection, however, if the end of the remaining life time comes earlier than that estimated because of changes in operation circumstance it is possible to prepare an operation plan which prevents the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof exceeding their life time from using. Therefore, the operation and maintenance plan aiding system for a power generation installation according to the present embodiment can avoid unpredictable circumstances which causes unplanned outage of the power generation unit due to an abnormality caused by the use of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof exceeding their life times, and can also avoid the economic loss caused by the unplanned outage of the power generation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Contrary to the above example, an example can be prepared in which, based on remaining life time diagnosis result evaluated in real time, the exchange timing of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof can be prolonged. For example, since a gas turbine is subjected to a high temperature and the deterioration thereof advances rapidly, an exchange standard time (for example, an accumulated operation time of 50,000 hours) is set in advance, and exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof is performed during the periodic inspection so as not to exceed the standard time. In such instance, if the remaining life time of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof remains long, it is not necessarily required to exchange the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof when the standard time is reached, and the exchange timing can be extended. In such instance, in comparison with the exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof with reference to the standard time, the maintenance cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Further, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses failure frequency of the machine and apparatus as one of parameters for preparing an operation plan.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the failure information data show failure histories caused in the respective power generation units, for example, at the first power generation unit in power generation plant A on Sep. 10, 2000 a packing deterioration in an A company manufactured valve of type VL 0010 was caused and the same was repaired and further it is indicated that the same valve was exchanged on Mar. 10, 1992. According to the contents of the failure information data it is understood that the valve has failed after about eight year and six month use. A similar information is indicated with regard to the pump in the second power generation unit in the power generation plant B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The failure frequency evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> evaluates with how much probability (once in how many years) a failure of the respective machines and apparatuses or the parts thereof is caused by making use of the data stored in the failure information data base <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and supplies the evaluation result to the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof in the respective power generation units can be used without failure upto which periodic inspection timing in future by making use of the evaluation result supplied from the failure frequency evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the reference result of the periodic information data base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, when it is estimated according to the failure probability of the machines and apparatuses or the parts thereof that there are machine and apparatus or the parts thereof which only endures upto the timing of the subsequent periodic inspection, exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof is planned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Further, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses a priority of manufacturers as one of parameters for preparing the operation plan.

In this instance, point <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assigned for A, point <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for B and point <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> for C, and by determining the total points the priority of the manufacturers are determined according to the total points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> When the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> selects a power generation unit for operation and if the manufacturer priority of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof used in the power generation unit is high, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares a plan which positively selects the concerned power generation unit for the operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, the role of the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> performed for a plurality of electric power generation companies will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents of another design information data base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and shows a structure of the design information data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the design information data are constituted for every electric power generation company by machines and apparatus and parts thereof constituting the respective power generation units and their supplying manufacturers and models for every machine, apparatus and part. For example, in the case of a first power generation unit (power generation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in A electric power generation company, a product of A company of type GT001 is employed as a gas turbine, and as parts constituting the gas turbine, a combustor of B company of type CB003, a turbine of A company of type TB001 and a compressor of A company of type CP001 are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents of another periodic inspection data base <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and shows a structure of the periodic inspection information data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the periodic inspection information data are information representing periodic inspection time already performed in the past and periodic inspection time to be performed in the future, and based on the periodic inspection information data the remaining days until the subsequent periodical inspection is calculated. The economic loss (L1) due to performance deterioration can be calculated by multiplying the estimated power generation amount (A&times;D1) until the subsequent periodic inspection by the power generation cost increase component (C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Because of performance deterioration of a power generation unit when the operation of the power generation unit is stopped. It is necessary to increase power generation amount of another power generation unit and to ensure the power generation amount meeting the electric power demand. In such instance, the followings may happen that the power generation cost (fuel cost per unit electric power output) increases, a power generation unit which is not used usually has to be operated and an electric power has to be purchased from another electric power generation company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> investigate a method of obtaining a necessary power generation amount not only by taking into account the power generation cost of a company of which owning power generation unit has been stopped but also the power generation cost of a power generation unit owned by another electric power generation company. As has been explained above, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calculates the power generation cost in real time based on the process values obtained from the power generation units. When stopping a power generation unit, at first with regard to respective power generation units owned by itself and others, respective power generation units having capacity of increasing the power generation amount and having the minimum power generation cost are searched. Subsequently, with regard to the power generation cost of the other company, a cost is calculated by adding a predetermined price on the power generation cost of its own company and the calculated cost is compared with the power generation cost of its own company. When the power generation cost of the other company is cheeper even in view of the added total price, it is determined that the electric power is to be purchased from the other company. Namely, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan so as to increase the power generation amount of the power generation unit of the other company. As has been explained above, with regard to the power generation amount adjustment between, for example, A electric power generation company <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and B electric power generation company <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the operation plant to the respective electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> via the communication network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and after obtaining agreement from the electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the operation plan is authorized. With regard to the agreement of the electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> confirms the same via the communication network <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are characteristic diagrams showing a selection principle of the power generation units. Now, when the maximum power generation amount and the load adjustment amount of a certain power generation unit are decreased and if an electric power shortage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is caused, the electric power shortage is supplemented as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), while dividing the supplementing electric power into base increase and peak response. With regard to the base increase a power generation unit with a low power generation cost is selected to increase the maximum power generation amount, and with regard to the peak response, a power generation unit having a longer remaining life time is selected to increase the load follow-up property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In parallel with the above operation plan, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares an operation plan in which another power generation unit having a higher power generation efficiency is positively selected for operation based on the power generation efficiency of the respective power generation units calculated in on-line. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the performance of a power generation unit is deteriorated, the power generation efficiency thereof is also reduced, therefore, a probability of operating such power generation unit is reduced. Then, the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> prepares a maintenance plan for performing exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof for the power generation unit of which operation is judged to be stopped according to the remaining life time diagnosis result for the respective power generation units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Generally, a power generation unit used for supplementing the power generation amount and the load adjustment is selected among the power generation units owned by itself, however, in case when such supplement can not be compensated by the power generation units owned by itself, an operation plan in which electric power is procured from the power generation units owned by other is prepared. In such instance, the price of the electric power is differentiated between a case wherein a predetermined amount of electric power is supplied for the base increase and a case wherein the supplied electric power varies depending on time for the peak response. Namely, with regard to the peak response since the load is frequently varied which likely shorten the life time of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof, therefore, the electric power price is determined by adding a predetermined value on the ordinary price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The above explanation shows an example in which, when preparing an operation and maintenance plan for power generation units by making use of the remaining life time data, deterioration of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof advances more than that estimated and the exchange timing is hastened. When preparing a usual operation and maintenance plan for power generation units, it is planned based on the remaining life time data to exchange the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof at the time of the periodic inspection, however, if the end of the remaining life time comes earlier than that estimated because of changes in operation circumstance, it is possible to prepare an operation plan which prevents the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof exceeding their life time from using. Therefore, the operation and maintenance plan aiding system for a power generation installation according to the present embodiment can avoid unpredictable circumstances which causes unplanned outage of the power generation unit due to an abnormality caused by the use of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof exceeding their life times, and can also avoid the economic loss caused by the unplanned outage of the power generation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Contrary to the above example, an example can be prepared in which, based on remaining life time diagnosis result evaluated in real time, the exchange timing of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof can be prolonged. For example, since a gas turbine is subjected to a high temperature and the deterioration thereof advances rapidly, an exchange standard time (for example, an accumulated operation time of 50,000 hours) is set in advance, and exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof is performed during the periodic inspection so as not to exceed the standard time. In such instance, if the remaining life time of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof remains long, it is not necessarily required to exchange the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof, when the standard time is reached and the exchange timing can be extended. In such instance, in comparison with the exchange of the machine and apparatus or the parts thereof with reference to the standard time, the maintenance cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Further, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses failure frequency of the machine and apparatus as one of parameters for preparing an operation plan. Hereinbelow, the processing for calculating the failure frequency of the machine and apparatus will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the failure frequency evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> evaluates the failure frequency of the machine and apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is a view for explaining storage contents of another failure information data base <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and shows a structure of the failure information data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the failure information data show failure histories caused in the respective power generation units, for example, at the first power generation unit in power generation company A on Sep. 10, 2000 a packing deterioration in an A company manufactured valve of type VL 0010 was caused and the same was repaired and further it is indicated that the same valve was exchanged on Mar. 10, 1992. According to the contents of the failure information data it is understood that the valve has failed after about eight year and six month use. A similar information is indicated with regard to the pump in the second power generation unit in the power generation company B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The failure frequency evaluation unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> evaluates with how much probability (once in how many years) a failure of the respective machines and apparatuses or the parts thereof is caused by making use of the data stored in the failure information data base <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and supplies the evaluation result to the operation plan evaluation unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As has been explained hitherto, although the operation and maintenance plan aiding system for a power generation installation according to the present embodiment uses the performance diagnosis result, the remaining life time diagnosis result, the failure frequency and the priority of manufacturers when preparing an operation and maintenance plan for the respective power generation units for every electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it is cost advantageous if adjusting the power generation units owned by other company and procuring the electric power from the other, and an operation and maintenance plan over the plurality of electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When the electric power is procured from the other company, payment of the electric power fee between the electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is necessitated, however, the electric power procurement usually occurs mutually between the plurality of electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it will be unnecessary to pay the electric power fee at every procurement, and it will be sufficient if after offsetting debits and credits for a predetermined period, for example, every one year, the balance is paid as the electric power fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the service center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> settles the agreement between these electric power generating companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and prepares a plan so that the total costs for operation and maintenance of the respective electric power generation companies <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are minimized. </paragraph>
