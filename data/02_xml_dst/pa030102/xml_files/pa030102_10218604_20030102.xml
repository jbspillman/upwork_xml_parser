<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a composition and uses thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition capable of providing a foamed product (non-crosslinked or crosslinked foamed product) having an Asker C hardness of 20 to 80, low specific gravity, low compression set (CS), excellent tear strength properties, excellent impact resilience and excellent moldability, and a foamed product thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Technique of using crosslinked foamed products to obtain resins having low specific gravity, i.e., lightweight properties, softness and high mechanical strength is widely used for building interior or exterior trim materials, automobile parts such as interior trim and door glass run channels, packaging materials, daily necessities, etc. The reason is that bonding of molecular chains through crosslinking reaction of a resin makes it possible to attain lightweight properties of the resin by foaming with inhibiting lowering of mechanical strength, though only foaming of the resin to obtain lightweight properties induces lowering of mechanical strength of the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Also for footwear and footwear parts such as soles (mainly midsoles) of sports shoes, crosslinked foamed products of resins are employed, and the reason is that materials which are lightweight, inhibit deformation caused by long-term use and have such mechanical strength and impact resilience that they can withstand severe use conditions are desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For the shoe soles, a crosslinked foamed product of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer has been heretofore used and is widely known. The crosslinked foamed product obtained by the use of the ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer has a problem that it has high specific gravity and high compression set, so that when it is used for shoe soles, the shoe soles are heavy, and if the shoe soles are used for a long period of time, they are compressed and lose mechanical strength such as impact resilience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In National Publication of International Patent No. 501447/1997 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 206406/1999, an invention relating to a crosslinked foamed product using an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer and an invention relating to a crosslinked foamed product using a mixture of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer are described, respectively. By the inventions, however, satisfactory performance has not been obtained though the low specific gravity and the property of the compression set have been improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 344924/2000 filed by the present inventors, an olefin elastomer crosslinked foamed product, which has high expansion ratio, is free from surface roughening due to defoaming and has soft touch, low compression set, excellent tear strength properties and excellent heat resistance, and an elastomer composition for the crosslinked foamed product are disclosed. That is to say, this crosslinked foamed product is obtained by heat-treating an olefin elastomer composition comprising an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A) having a density of 0.88 to 0.92 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and a melt flow rate (190&deg; C.) of 0.1 to 10 g/10 min, an organic peroxide (B), a crosslinking assistant (C) and a blowing agent (D) The ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A) comprises 5 to 95 parts by weight of an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A1&prime;) having a density of not less than 0.88 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and less than 0.90 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and a melt flow rate (190&deg; C.) of 0.1 to 50 g/10 min and 5 to 95 parts by weight of an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A2&prime;) having a density of 0.90 to 0.93 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and a melt flow rate (190&deg; C.) of 0.1 to 50 g/10 min, the total of said components (A1&prime;) and (A2&prime;) being 100 parts by weight, and the mixture of the ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymers (A1&prime;) and (A2&prime;) has a melt flow rate (190&deg; C.) of 0.5 to 10 g/10 min. In this invention, the ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A2&prime;) having a relatively high density is incorporated in order to secure a hardness necessary for the resulting crosslinked foamed product, for example, a hardness necessary for footwear. The hardness necessary for footwear cannot be secured by only incorporation of the ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A1&prime;) of a relatively low density alone, and the resulting crosslinked foamed product is unsatisfactory for footwear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A2&prime;), however, has a problem. That is, in order to increase a surface hardness of the resulting crosslinked foamed product, the copolymer (A2&prime;) is liable to have a higher melting point as compared with the ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A1&prime;), and hence kneading operation becomes difficult. More specifically, the copolymer (A2&prime;) has a problem that in the kneading process, a high energy is necessary or mixing is not made well, and in an extreme case, a kneading device is broken. In case of a usual composition containing a high-melting point component, the above-mentioned kneading problem is solved by elevating the kneading temperature. In case of a foamable composition, however, the kneading operation needs to be carried out at a temperature lower than the prescribed temperature (usually not higher than 100&deg; C.) because the elevated kneading temperature decomposes the blowing agent and/or the crosslinking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have earnestly studied to solve the kneading problem mentioned above, and as a result, have found that the kneading can be facilitated and a crosslinked foamed product having a hardness enough for a footwear foamed product can be obtained by adopting an ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A2) having a density of 0.900 to 0.930 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, a melt flow rate (ASTM D 1238, 190&deg; C., load of 2.16 kg) of 0.1 to 50 g/10 min and a main melting point peak at a position of not higher than 110&deg; C., instead of the above-mentioned ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A2&prime;) and that an excellent interlaminar adhesive strength of the laminate comprising a layer of the foamed product and a layer of at least one material selected from the group consisting of a polyolefin, a polyurethane, a rubber, a leather and an artificial leather can be obtained especially when both the above-mentioned ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymers (A1) and (A2) contained in the composition of the foamed product are ethylene/1-butene copolymers. Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished. </paragraph>

Specific examples of the inorganic thermal decomposition type blowing agents include bicarbonates, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate and ammonium hydrogencarbonate; carbonates, such as sodium carbonate and ammonium carbonate; nitrites, such as ammonium nitrite; and hydrogen compounds. Of these, azodicarbonamide (ADCA) and sodium hydrogencarbonate are particularly preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a physical blowing agent (blowing agent which is not always accompanied by chemical reaction in the foaming process) such as an organic physical blowing agent or an inorganic physical blowing agent is also employable as the blowing agent (B). Examples of the organic physical blowing agents include methanol; ethanol; various aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as propane, butane, pentane and hexane; various chlorohydrocarbons, such as dichloroethane, dichloromethane and carbon tetrachloride; and various fluorochlorohydrocarbons, such as Freon. Examples of the inorganic physical blowing agents include air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon and water. Of these, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon are the most preferable from the viewpoint of the need of vaporization, cost, environmental pollution and the probability of the ignition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As the physical blowing agent used as a blowing agent (B) in the present invention is decomposed completely without the residue, it prevents stains of the mold at the crosslinking foaming process of the composition. Moreover, as the physical blowing agent is not powdery, it is superior to the kneadability. And when this physical blowing agent is used, the smell (an ammonia smell at ADCA decomposition etc.) of the obtained crosslinked foamed product can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the above-mentioned chemical blowing agent can be used together with the physical blowing agent within limits not detrimental to the occurrences of the smell and the mold strain etc. </paragraph>

If the storage pressure is too low, it cannot be supplied through a pressure-reducing valve to an injection molding machine or an extrusion molding machine. And if the storage pressure is too high, it is not preferable because the design pressure of the storage facilities has to be raised and they become oversized or complicated. The definition of the storage pressure in the invention is a pressure before supplying a pressure-reducing valve after vaporization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When a chemical blowing agent is used as the blowing agent (B), the chemical blowing agent is used in an amount of usually 3 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 15 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the ethylene/&agr;-olefin copolymer (A). However, the amount of the chemical blowing agent can be increased or decreased appropriately to be the desired expansion ratio, because the gas evolved is different depending upon the kind or the grade of the chemical blowing agent used. </paragraph>
