<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of the Background of the Invention Including Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Immunomodulatory effective compositions have been described several times in the patented literature, for example in the printed Patent Document WO 98/56405 as a pharmaceutical composition. Modulators of the human immune system are subject matter of the European patent application EP 0109089, wherein the modulators have been isolated from dialyzates of leucocyte extracts. Methods and compositions for modulating the immune answer are mentioned in the printed Patent document WO 94/226114. Compositions for treatment of immune weakness can be gathered from the international patent application WO 94/010980, wherein the compositions for example comprise an anti-cytokinesis antibody. The printed Patent document WO 95/07933 describes compositions which contain antibodies or antibody like molecules of primary antigens. A possible immuno active composition is reported in the printed Patent document WO 98/52605, wherein the possible immuno active composition comprises an antigen or an antigen inducing substance as well as a carrier and is to effect an increase in the immune response. The patent application WO 98/57620 describes a composition for modulating the immune response in mammals. A stereo isomer of inositol, its derivatives, salts and mixtures is recited there as a therapeutic agent. This agent increases or, respectively, suppresses the B-and/or T- lymphocyte activity. Antigen inducers and anti-toxins having high selectivity and specificity and capable of being employed as regulators of the immune response are subject matter of the printed Patent document WO 98/32431. </paragraph>
