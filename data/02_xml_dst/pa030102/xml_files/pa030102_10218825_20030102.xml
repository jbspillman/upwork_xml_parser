<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the fabrication of semiconductor devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to disposable spacers, methods of forming such disposable spacers, and methods of using such disposable spacers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As the size of semiconductor devices decreases, various problems arise. Particularly, the control of device characteristics, such as transistors, becomes more difficult as the feature size of devices goes below one micron. In order to control device characteristics, it is important to control processes such as ion implantation and etching during the fabrication of these devices. One technique for controlling such processes involves the use of permanent spacers and disposable spacers. For example, spacers may be utilized to offset the implantation of ions relative to another structural feature of the device or offset an etch of a material relative to a different region of the device being fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For illustration, in submicron CMOS technologies, PMOS devices typically show a short channel behavior, which is partly caused by lateral diffusion of a dopant, such as boron, into the gate channel of the PMOS device after implant of active areas of the PMOS device. Although, typically, a permanent spacer is utilized for offset of the ion implant from the gate edge in order to widen the gate channel, the spacer width for the PMOS device is usually determined based on the spacer width necessary to create an adequately sized gate channel for NMOS devices fabricated at the same time. Such a spacer width is typically too small to account for the larger diffusion of, for example, boron, into the gate channel of the PMOS device, as opposed to the diffusion of arsenic into the gate channel of an NMOS device. As such, the gate channel is usually shorter than desired for the PMOS device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, the gate has a large stack height that permits the formation of an additional spacer for PMOS devices to offset the ion implant (i.e., boron) further from the gate so as to allow for greater lateral diffusion in the underlying substrate. Various spacer materials are available; however, use of such spacers creates other problems. For example, a polysilicon spacer could be utilized to offset the implant. However, the removal of the polysilicon spacer after the implant is performed, is difficult to achieve without leaving stringers or over etching into the poly gate or substrate. Further, for example, a silicon nitride spacer if used creates too small of a permanent gap between narrowly spaced gates (i.e., wordlines) for the formation of a bit line contact therebetween. Further, for example, an oxide spacer could also be utilized. However, the removal of the oxide spacer would lead to a loss of field oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An additional illustration of controlling semiconductor device characteristics through the use of fabrication techniques includes the use of an ion implantation in a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) process to optimize isolation between the active areas of the devices fabricated. Such a field implant during the LOCOS process is commonly referred to as a channel stop implant. However, the channel stop implant introduces a dopant diffusion encroachment problem wherein the dopant laterally diffuses into active area/channel regions formed by the LOCOS process. The overall effect is that the width of the channel/electrical active area being formed by the LOCOS process is undesirably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More particularly, a silicon nitride mask is typically utilized as the oxidation mask for the LOCOS process. Although spacers have been formed relative to the silicon nitride mask for offsetting the channel stop implant, such spacers also cause problems as in the case of polysilicon, silicon nitride, or oxide spacers. Such problems include changing the shape of the field oxide grown, removal of portions of the field oxide during etching of the spacer such as with use of an oxide spacer, or, for example, some of the materials may not be selectively etchable relative to the oxidation mask. For example, if a silicon nitride spacer is utilized with a silicon nitride oxidation mask, selective removal would not be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For the above reasons, there is a need in the art for new disposable spacers, in addition to methods of forming and using such spacers to provide desirable semiconductor device characteristics. The present invention, as described below, overcomes the problems described above and other problems which will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the description below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The formation and utilization of germanium-silicon disposable spacers in accordance with the present invention shall be generally described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> device structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include various regions of material. Device structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, and as will be described in further detail below, the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a silicon substrate, portions of which are to be doped, and second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be, for example, an oxidation mask or any other device structure typically used in fabrication processes. Further, the regions of material may have various surfaces, such as, for example, sidewalls <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> During the fabrication of various semiconductor devices, spacers are utilized to offset implants and/or etches for various device structures. The present invention contemplates the use of germanium-silicon alloy (Ge<highlight><subscript>(x)</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>(1-x)</subscript></highlight>) disposable spacers for use in performing various fabrication processes, such as, for example, offset implants or etches. The device structures with which the germanium-silicon disposable spacers are utilized may include any and all materials typically utilized in a fabrication process as are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To form the germanium-silicon disposable spacers, a germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed conformally over the device structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including the first and second regions of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. The germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (Ge<highlight><subscript>(x)</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>(1-x)</subscript></highlight>) is made of a first portion of germanium (x) and a second portion of silicon (1-x) in the alloy structure. Various percentages of germanium and silicon, such as wherein x is greater than about 0.2 provide benefits in accordance with the present invention. Preferably, x is greater than about 0.7 and even greater 0.9. As used herein, Ge<highlight><subscript>(x)</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>(1-x) </subscript></highlight>and the alloy description including a first portion of germanium (x) and a second portion of silicon (1-x), are equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed by any known method. For example, the germanium-silicon alloy may be deposited by conventional sputtering or chemical vapor deposition techniques, or grown by gas source silicon molecular beam epitaxy as noted in the article by Koyama et. al., entitled &ldquo;Etching characteristics of Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Ge<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>alloy in ammoniac wet cleaning,&rdquo; Appl. Phys. Lett. Vol. 57, No. 21, Nov. 19, 1990, pages 2202-04, herein entirely incorporated by reference. As chemical vapor deposition generally provides better step coverage it is preferably utilized. Such chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of the germanium-silicon layer may be performed, for example, at a temperature in the range of about 400&deg; C. to about 600&deg; C., preferably about 400&deg; C. to about 500&deg; C. The layer formed may be of a thickness of about 200 &angst; to about 1000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The germanium-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then etched to form disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, which are aligned to existing structures such as the second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in contact with a portion of the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the base <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. To form the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the germanium-silicon layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably dry etched utilizing a plasma, including a fluorine and/or chlorine containing gas, in much the same manner as polysilicon is dry etched. For example, such plasma may be a CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, a Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, an NF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, or any other fluorine and/or chlorine containing gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although various examples are given for forming the germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and also for etching the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to such illustrative examples. Such processes of formation and etching may be performed by any method suitable for forming and etching a germanium-silicon alloy layer and the present invention is limited only as described in the accompanying claims. For example, sputtering may be performed in various manners, CVD may be performed in various manners and at various parameters (i.e. low pressure CVD, plasma enhanced CVD, etc.), and etching may include any anisotropic etch using various solutions or plasmas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> After the spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have been formed, at least one portion of the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is materially altered. Such alteration may occur as a result of an etchant or as a result of ion implantation. Such etchant or ion implantation is represented generally by the arrows <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, the material alteration of the portions of the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> result in materially altered regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, if an ion implantation <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is performed, regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would be ion implanted regions offset relative to the second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or if an etching step was performed, then the dashed lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> represent regions of the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> offset a distance relative to the second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that would be removed by means of the etchant. It should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that both an etch and an implant or any other process may be carried out using the same spacer or carried out using different disposable spacers at different processing points of the device being fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After the offset implant or etch of the portions of the first region of material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the second region of material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are removed. The germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are easily removed with good selectivity to other materials typically utilized in semiconductor fabrication processes such as, for example, silicon nitride and oxides. The method of removing the germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> varies depending upon the content of the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If the germanium content is high relative to the silicon content, i.e., greater than about 20% germanium, then the germanium-silicon spacer is preferably removed by oxidation and volatilization of the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> followed by a water rinse. In removing the germanium-silicon disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by oxidation, the device structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including the spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, are oxidized at a temperature less than about <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>&deg; C. In this range, germanium will oxidize and Ge<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>O will be formed. The Ge<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>O gas is then removed. Any unvolatilized Ge<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>O remaining is water soluble and is removed with a deionized water rinse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In another process of removing the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as when the silicon content is towards the 80% range, an ammonium hydroxide wet clean is utilized, such as an RCA clean as described in the Koyama et al. reference listed above. The removal will, of course, depend upon the content of the alloy and amount of material to be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are stable to withstand ion implantation. Further, the germanium-silicon spacers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have good selectivity to various other materials used in semiconductor fabrication processes, such as oxides, nitrides, or polysilicon to allow for easy removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, a disposable spacer made of germanium-silicon alloy is utilized during the fabrication process to allow for offset of implants and/or etches, or any other process that may benefit from use of such a disposable spacer. Further, the germanium-silicon disposable spacers are easily removed with good selectivity to various other materials in the semiconductor fabrication processes, and therefore, the spacers use does not interfere with such existing processes. The germanium-silicon disposable spacers are easily integrated into well established process flows, such as those described in the illustrations below. The illustrations given below describe two process flows which benefit from the use of the germanium-silicon disposable spacer formed in accordance with the present invention. However, there are various other offset implant and offset etching processes which may benefit from the use of a germanium-silicon disposable spacer and the present invention as described herein is not limited to only those process flows illustrated but only as described in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first illustrative process flow utilizing the germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers in accordance with the present invention shall be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>F, which illustrates conventional processing associated with ion implantation in the fabrication of CMOS devices, and with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E, which illustrates ion implantation of CMOS devices utilizing disposable spacers in accordance with the present invention. In particular, the process described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E provides for the optimization of spacer width for PMOS devices resulting in lengthened gate channels relative to the conventional processing techniques described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>F. Further, the offset implant is described relative to the PMOS gate structure such that the narrowing down of the gap between the gates being fabricated is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows an illustrative cross-section of a wafer after gate and permanent spacer formation in a conventional CMOS process before the source and drain for the PMOS and NMOS devices are implanted. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the CMOS device structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at this point in the process, includes N-well <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and P-well <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Field oxide regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have also been formed. Further, NMOS gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and PMOS gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> have been formed in addition to stack <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The NMOS gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes, for example, a polysilicon region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a metal silicide region <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (i.e. tungsten silicide), along with permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a nitride cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> thereover. PMOS gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes similar regions including permanent spacers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and stack <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also includes similar regions including permanent spacers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After formation of the permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, conventional photolithography utilizing photoresist <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is performed to implant n-type ions, such as, for example, arsenic, into P-well <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as generally represented by arrows <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. N-type active regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are formed therefore in P-well <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on respective sides of NMOS gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> provide for offset of the arsenic ion implantation relative to the NMOS gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to keep the channel width at a desired length while allowing for some diffusion of arsenic ions into the gate channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After completion of the arsenic ion implantation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, conventional photolithography utilizing photoresist <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is then utilized to implant p-type dopant ions into N-well <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for formation of p-type active regions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. For example, the ion implantation may include the use of boron difluoride to implant boron ions to create the p-type active regions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as generally shown by arrows <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The implantation of boron difluoride ions is offset from PMOS gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by permanent spacers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed at the same time as permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and, therefore, of substantially the same width. After the boron difluoride ion implantation is performed, the photoresist <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is removed, resulting in the device structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The problem associated with such conventional processes as just described is best shown and described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 2F</cross-reference>, which are enlarged illustrations of the gate region of the NMOS device including gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and respective n-type active areas <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and of the gate region of the PMOS device including gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and respective p-type active regions <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</cross-reference> show the typically short channel behavior which is caused by lateral diffusion of p-type ions, such as boron, after the boron difluoride ion implantation. As the permanent spacer width of both spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and spacers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the offset of implantation from the gate edge of both the NMOS and PMOS gates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, is usually optimized for the NMOS devices, the permanent spacers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the PMOS gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are too small to account for the larger diffusion of boron in the gate channel of the PMOS device. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, the gate channel width after implantation is shown by the distance <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This channel width is adequate for NMOS device characteristics as the permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are of a width optimized to account for the lateral diffusion of n-type dopant into the channel. Even after additional heating steps, the channel distance <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is adequate to provide the desired NMOS characteristics. Again, this is because the permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> have a width optimized for providing for such a gate channel distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> However, the gate channel width <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for the PMOS device, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>F, becomes inadequate (i.e., channel distance <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>) for PMOS circuit characteristics after heat treatments are performed with respect to the fabrication of the devices, for example, such as reflow heat treatments. Lateral diffusion of p-type dopants, such as, for example, boron into the channel leaves a gate channel distance <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, that is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With use of germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers in accordance with the present invention, the ion implant utilizing p-type dopants, such as, for example, boron, is offset giving more room for lateral diffusion without causing short channel effects in the PMOS device. Further, a wet clean removal and/or removal of the disposable spacers by oxidation, as previously described, at a temperature below about 750&deg; C. will not cause an enhanced lateral diffusion of the boron after implant. Yet further, such removal results in no field oxide loss, and with the removal of the disposable spacers after they are used for the offset implant, gap distances between the gates remain unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The optimization of spacer width and resulting length in gate channels of PMOS devices is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E. After implantation of n-type dopant (such as arsenic) to form the active regions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the device structure <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B and removal of photoresist <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the present invention includes depositing a layer of germanium-silicon alloy <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> over the CMOS device structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is conformally deposited on the device structure, including the surfaces of permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a manner previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> After deposition of the germanium-silicon alloy layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is dry etched to form germanium-silicon disposable spacers aligned to the permanent spacers. Disposable spacers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are aligned to sidewalls of permanent spacers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the NMOS gate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, disposable spacers <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are aligned with permanent spacers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of stack <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and disposable spacers <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are aligned with sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the permanent spacers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of PMOS gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Photolithography techniques are then utilized to implant a p-type dopant, such as boron, as shown generally by arrows <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, to form p-type regions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> offset from gate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The photoresist <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is then removed after the ion implantation <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is completed forming the p-type (i.e., boron) regions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The disposable spacers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are then removed by oxidation or wet etching, as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D and 3E</cross-reference> show the resulting NMOS and PMOS gate regions, respectively, in an enlarged illustration. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, the gate channel distance <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for the NMOS device is left unchanged relative to conventional processing. However, with use of the germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention, the channel distance <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is increased and can be optimized by offsetting the p-type dopant implant relative to the gate structure. After heat treatments, lateral diffusion of boron into the gate channel still results in a gate channel distance <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that provides adequate PMOS characteristics as the offset implant is optimized to allow for such diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although the above illustration has been described with reference to the implant of boron ions, utilizing boron difluoride, other ion implantation processes, such as, for example, implanting arsenic, phosphorous, or any other ion implanted in fabrication processes can likewise be offset from device structure as would be known and apparent to one skilled in the art. The present invention is not limited to the ion implantation illustration above, but is only limited as described in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A further illustration of the utilization of the disposable spacers in accordance with the present invention shall be described with reference to conventional LOCOS processing steps, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E, and LOCOS processing in accordance with the present invention utilizing germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D. The conventional LOCOS process, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E, includes forming an oxidation mask (such as LOCOS stacks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) on silicon substrate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. For example, the stacks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may include silicon nitride regions <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, respectively, over an oxide pad, as shown by regions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, respectively. The oxidation mask, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, allows for oxidation in regions <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Typically, a self-aligned field implant (i.e., channel stop implant) is utilized for isolation of devices formed between the regions <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the field implant generally represented by arrows <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may be performed before, during, or after the field oxidation formation of field oxide regions <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The field implant creates channel stop regions <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. After the field oxide is grown and the channel stop regions <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are formed, the final LOCOS profile before gate formation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C, i</cross-reference>.e., the oxidation mask is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> With respect to conventional processing, lateral diffusion of the ions implanted by the channel stop implant reduce the channel width between the regions <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and field oxide regions <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</cross-reference>, respectively, particularly after heat treatment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> shows a channel width <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> after ion implantation prior to field oxide growth, and a channel width <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> after heat treatment, also prior to field oxide growth. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows the lateral diffusion of the ion implantation after field oxide has been grown. For example, prior to heat treatment, the channel width <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> decreases to a channel width <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> after heat treatment due to lateral diffusion. Such decreased channel widths are undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the LOCOS process utilizing the germanium-silicon alloy disposable spacers provide a channel that is not shortened due to lateral diffusion of a dopant material for the channel stop implant. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the silicon nitride oxidation mask or any other oxidation mask is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Germanium-silicon disposable spacers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are then formed in the same manner as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The spacers may be formed for offset of the implant from the LOCOS stacks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> before the field oxide is grown. The disposable spacers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may also be formed and the implant performed after the field oxide regions <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are grown, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Likewise, the ion implantation may be performed and the disposable spacers formed at any point in time during the growth of the field oxide. The required stopping power for the implant determines at which field oxide thickness the implant is to be done. At any time between, during, or after the field oxidation, the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> provide the offset required for the channel stop implant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The channel stop implant may be, for example, an implantation of boron or any other channel stop dopant as required for performing the desired function. The channel stop implant is generally represented by arrows <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The channel stop implant creates channel stop regions <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> and also shown in the enlarged illustrations of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the channel distance <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (after heat treatment) is optimized for later device processing by offsetting the implant relative to the oxidation mask using the disposable spacers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> allowing for the lateral diffusion of ions into the channel region yet maintaining suitable channel length. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, when the spacer and the implant is performed after the field oxide has been grown, the channel distance <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is also optimized by offsetting the implant relative to the oxidation mask a suitable distance to provide the desired length of the channel formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As would be known to one skilled in the art, the germanium-silicon disposable spacer, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, may also be utilized to offset the etch of a trench in the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as opposed to implanting ions offset from mask <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Further, it is possible that the same disposable spacer may be utilized for etching the trench offset from the oxidation mask in the LOCOS process, as well as for offsetting the implant for creating the channel stop regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is again noted that the illustrations described above are provided to describe several semiconductor fabrication processes which utilize the disposable spacer made of germanium-silicon alloy in order to offset an implantation or an etch from various device structures. The present invention contemplates the use of such germanium-silicon disposable spacers for many and various offset implants or etches during the fabrication of semiconductor devices or any other processes where such a disposable spacer may be beneficial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with particular reference to a preferred embodiments thereof, variations and modifications of the present invention can be made within a contemplated scope of the following claims as is readily known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
