<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a reinforced matrix, and a method to stabilize and reinforce matrices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Injuries to the cartilage of the knee or other joints often result from abnormal mechanical loads which deform the cartilage matrix. The loads applied to the joint can rupture the collagen network in the matrix and decrease the stiffness of the cartilage matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cartilage injuries are difficult to treat because human articular cartilage has a limited capacity for regeneration once it has been damaged. Type II collagen is the main structural protein of the extracellular matrix in articular cartilage. Type II collagen, similar to other types of collagen, is comprised of three collagen polypeptides which form a triple helix configuration. The polypeptides are intertwined with each other and possess at each end telopeptide regions that provide the cross-linking between the collagen polypeptides. Collagen matrices in their natural state contain numerous cross-linked triple helices and the individual molecules have a molecular weight of about 300,000 daltons. Type II collagen is found almost exclusively in animal cartilage, while other types of collagen are found in animal hides, membranes, and bones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Excessive degradation of Type II collagen in the outer layers of articular surfaces ofjoints is also caused by osteoarthritis. The collagen network is accordingly weakened and subsequently develops fibrillation whereby matrix substances, such as proteoglycans, are lost and eventually displaced entirely. Such fibrillation of weakened osteoarthritic cartilage can reach down to the calcified cartilage and into the subchondral bone (Kempson, G. E. et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1976, 428, 741; Roth, V. and Mow, V. C., J. Bone Joint Surgery, 1980, 62A, 1102; Woo, S. L.-Y. et al., in Handbook of Bioengineering (R. Skalak and S. Chien Eds), McGraw-Hill, New York, 1987, pp. 4.1-4.44). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A method for regeneration-treatment of cartilage would be useful for treating arthritis and otherjoint conditions and could be performed at an earlier stage ofjoint damage, thus reducing the number of patients needing more extensive procedures, such as artificial joint replacement surgery. With such preventive methods of treatment, the number of patients developing osteoarthritis would also decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Methods for growing and using chondrocyte cells are described by Brittberg, M. et al. (New Engl. J. Med. 1994, 331, 889). Autologous transplants using cells grown with these methods are also disclosed. Additionally, Kolettas et al. examined the expression of cartilage-specific molecules, such as collagens and proteoglycans, under prolonged cell culturing (J. Cell Science 1995, 108, 1991). They found that, despite morphological changes during culturing in monolayer cultures (Aulthouse, A. et al., In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol., 1989, 25, 659; Archer, C. et al., J. Cell Sci. 1990, 97, 361; Hanselmann, H. et al., J. Cell Sci. 1994, 107, 17; Bonaventure, J. et al., Exp. Cell Res. 1994, 212, 97), when compared to suspension cultures grown over agarose gels, alginate beads or as spinner cultures (which retain a round cell morphology) tested by various scientists, such morphologies did not change the chondrocyte&mdash;that is, expressed markers such as types II and IX collagens and the large aggregating proteoglycans, aggrecan, versican and link protein did not change (Kolettas, E. et al., J. Cell Science 1995, 108, 1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, chondrocyte cells from donors have been grown in vitro to form neocartilage which has been implanted into animals (Adkisson et al., &ldquo;A Novel Scaffold-Independent Neocartilage Graft for Articular Cartilage Repair,&rdquo; ICRS 2nd Symposium International Cartilage Repair Society, Nov. 16-18, 1998). Further, chondrocyte cells have been seeded onto the cartilage surface of osteochondral cores to attempt cartilage regeneration (Albrecht et al., &ldquo;Circumferential Seeding of Chondrocytes: Towards Enhancement of Integrative Cartilage Repair,&rdquo; ICRS 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Symposium International Cartilage Repair Society, Nov. 16-18, 1998). Articular surface defects in knee joints have been treated with various cultured chondrocytes (Stone et al., Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics 7(4), pp. 305-311, Oct. 1997 and Minas et al., Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics 7(4), pp. 323-333, Oct. 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,934 to Stone is directed to a prosthetic resorbable meniscus formed from biocompatible and bioresorbable fibers. The fibers include natural fibers or analogs of natural fibers. The natural fibers useful in the invention include collagen, elastin, reticulin, analogs thereof, and mixtures thereof. The fibers are oriented in the matrix circumferentially or radially, or alternatively, the fibers may have random orientations. The fiber may be cross-linked, and the matrix optionally may include glycosaminoglycans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,278 &mdash;Geistlich et al. describe a collagen-containing membrane which is resorbable and is used in guided tissue regeneration. The membrane has a fibrous face which allows cell growth thereon and a smooth face opposite the fibrous face which inhibits cell adhesion thereon. The membrane product is derived from a natural collagen membrane (that is, from the hide or tendons of calves or piglets) and, although treated, it is described as maintaining its natural structural features. The collagen is purified with alkaline agents to defat the collagen and degrade substances, and then the purified collagen is acidified, washed, dried, degreased, and optionally cross-linked. The fats are saponified. The membrane is described as containing about 95% by weight native collagen. The collagen does not appear to contain a reinforcing protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> PCT WO 96/25961 &mdash;Geistlich et al. describe a matrix for reconstructing cartilage tissue which consists of Type II collagen, optionally including crosslinking. In producing the matrix, cartilage is taken from an animal and frozen, subjected to size reduction, dewatered, defatted, washed, and treated with alkaline materials. Non-collagen alkaline soluble proteins are denatured, destroyed, dissolved, and eliminated. Dialysis and freeze-drying are mentioned as possible treatment steps. The matrix material is stamped to form a required shape and then it is sterilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,208 &mdash;Wallace et al. describe an injectable collagen implant material comprising particulate cross-linked atelopeptide collagen and reconstituted atelopeptide collagen fibers dispersed in an aqueous carrier. The atelopeptide form of collagen lacks the native telopeptide crosslinking. In the method described in the &apos;208 patent, collagen obtained from bovine or porcine corium (sub-epithelial skin layer) is softened by soaking in a mild acid; depiliated; comminuted by physical treatment, such as grinding; solubilized by treatment with acid and a proteolytic enzyme; treated with an alkaline solution; and freed of enzyme. The cross-linked gel form of collagen is formed by radiation-induced or chemical-induced crosslinking, such as by addition of glutaraldehyde. The fibrous form of collagen is produced by neutralizing the solution with a buffer, such as Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO4. Collagen content of the injectable implant comprises 5-30% fibrous collagen and 70-98% of the cross-linked gel form of collagen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,488,911 &mdash;Luck et al. describe the formation of collagen fibers free of the immunogenic, telopeptide portion of native collagen. The telopeptide region provides points of crosslinking in native collagen. The fibers, which may be cross-linked, are described for use as sponges, prosthetic devices, films, membranes, and sutures. In the method described in the &apos;911 patent, (non-Type II; Type I and others), collagen obtained from tendons, skin, and connective tissue of animals, such as a cow, is dispersed in an acetic acid solution, passed through a meat chopper, treated with pepsin to cleave the telopeptides and solubilize the collagen, precipitated, dialyzed, cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde, sterilized, and lyophilized. The &apos;911 patent indicates that its disclosed method obtains the atelocollagen form of collagen, free from noncollagen proteins, such as glycosaminoglycans and lipids. Further, it describes that the collagen may be used as a gel to make, for example, a membrane, film, or sponge and that the degree of crosslinking of the collagen can be controlled to alter its structural properties. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Currently available matrices and membranes having different chemical moieties show a very limited mechanical strength. Most of these matrices or membranes disintegrate after a short period of exposure to cells. Mechanical stability is essential for manipulation of cell-loaded matrices for tissue implantations. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a protein scaffold effective and efficient to reinforce matrices to create new matrices suitable for arthroscopic or other minimal invasive transplantations of chondrocytes or other cells, such as osteoblasts, or mesenchymal stem cells into an area to be treated. The present invention is also directed to polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid reinforcement scaffolds useful in reinforcing matrices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> While analyzing the degradation behavior of different types of collagen materials, it was surprisingly discovered that certain matrix structures were easily degraded by collagenase, but not by trypsin. Other matrix structures demonstrated a significant loss of mechanical strength after treatment with trypsin, but not after treatment with collagenase. In some cases, a combined or subsequent treatment of collagenase and trypsin did not show any significant effect on mechanical strength of the membrane. A subsequent systematic analysis showed that natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic membranes consisting of pure collagen Type I, Type I/III, or Type II structures without or with only a partial cross-linking were susceptible to degradation with collagenase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Some natural membranes from peritoneum or skin from different animals, such as pigs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, chicken, kangaroos, as well as some commercially available membranes (such as Chondro-Gide&reg; or Chondro-Cell,&reg; from Ed Geistlich Sohne, Switzerland) were found to be quite resistant to collagenase although they contained collagen. Treatment of these membranes with trypsin or trypsin/collagenase, however, showed complete degradation within a certain period of time, that varied in connection with the origin and thickness of the material. These findings suggested the existence of an additional protein scaffold that is not degraded by collagenase and significantly contributes to the mechanical strength and stability of the respective material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One protein which formed such a scaffold was identified as elastin, however other non-soluble polymeric biodegradable proteins will also work. One example of elastin that can be used in accordance with the present invention is the elastin fractions described by Partridge et al. (Biochem. J. 61: 11-21, 1954), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Specifically, elastin is extracted and purified from the ligamentum nuchae of cattle to yield a soluble and substantially pure elastin powder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, different elastin structures, such as those described by Debelle and Alix (Biochimie 81: 981-994, 1999), which is hereby incorporated by reference, can also be used in accordance with the present invention. Elastin is constituted of globular tropoelastin monomers with substantial amounts of irregular and distorted &bgr;-structures. Further, elastin structures are mobile and influenced by the presence of water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Elastin from different animal species can also be employed. Elastin may be obtained from human, bovine, porcine chicken, sheep, goat, and kangaroo sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Elastin-like peptides can also be used, such as those prepared and described by Davril and Han (FEBS Letters 43: 331-336, 1974), which is hereby incorporated by reference. In particular, these porcine elastin-like peptides are enriched desmosine or isodesmosine by enzymatic and chemical digestion of porcine aorta with elastase, themolysin and pancreatic proteases followed by gel filtration, electrophoresis and paper chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additionally, salt-soluble elastin can also be used in accordance 15 with the present invention, such as that described by Smith et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 8: 2427-2432, 1972) and Manning et al. (Connective Tissue Res. 13: 313-322, 1985), both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Salt-soluble elastin can be prepared and purified from porcine aorta by extraction, precipitation and sequential centrifugation or from sheep vascular tissue by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a column of decyl-agarose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Treatment of some of the analyzed membranes with different concentrations of elastase lead also to a significant degradation of the analyzed product. Membranes resistant to trypsin, collagenase and elastase were either fully synthetic, such as polyethylenglycol or polyethylenoxide/polybutyleneterephtalate co-polymers, or were natural and contained additional chemical crosslinking agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> We demonstrated that incubation of collagen matrices with different quantities of a scaffold forming protein such as elastin significantly increased the mechanical stability of the matrix without affecting the biodegradability of the matrix. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention teaches methods to increase the mechanical strength and stability of collagen matrices and materials using a scaffold forming protein. These reinforced collagen matrices may then be used for a variety of purposes, including cell (e.g., chondrocyte cells) cultivation and implantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Suitable matrix materials according to the present invention are characterized as having the ability to enable the growth and attachment of cells such as chondrocytes, and provide a system similar to the natural environment of the cartilage cells. The matrix material is stable for a sufficient period of time to allow full cartilage repair and to be reabsorbed or broken down over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Suitable matrix materials include collagen, hyaluronic acid and its derivatives, homologs and analogs; polylactic and polyglycolic acids; polyethylene oxide; and mixtures thereof; fibrin; proteoglycans; proteins and sugars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Matrix materials for the present invention are prepared from natural sources such as animal skin, peritoneum, or animal cartilage, according to generally accepted and described methods, such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/467,584; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,201,745 and 5,837,278; and PCT WO 96/25961, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one such method, the cartilage tissue obtained from the animal is solubilized by physical and/or chemical treatment as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/467,584, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The solubilization process includes treatment with various buffers to remove impurities and to separate solid and liquid phases; physical treatment to separate solid and liquid phases, such as by centrifugation; and treatment with a proteolytic enzyme to break the crosslinking of the collagen in its telopeptide region into its virtually non-cross-linked atelocollagen, triple helix form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> By reconstituting, it is meant that the non-cross-linked, atelocollagen form of collagen reestablishes its crosslinking between the variable regions along the collagen molecule, including some remaining residues in the telopeptide region. As a result, the collagen loses its liquid or gel-like consistency and becomes more rigid with a higher degree of structural integrity such that cells may be grown upon it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the collagen matrix is prepared by incubating a matrix with a suspension of elastin, under conditions that will not break down the protein structure. The matrix is prepared under temperature conditions in the range of ambient to 80&deg; C. and under pH conditions in the range of 4-9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the matrix composition is formed from recombinantly produced Type II collagen. The substantially pure, recombinantly produced Type II collagen is not cross-linked. However, it can have telopeptide regions. In an embodiment, it is soluble and can be formed into a fleece-like structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Matrices for use in the present invention are also commercially available. One material identified as suitable is Chondro-Cell&reg; (a type II collagen matrix pad, Geistlich und Sohne, Switzerland). Another material which may be used in the present invention is Chondro-Gide&reg; (a type I collagen matrix pad, Geistlich und Sohne, Switzerland). Additional matrices for use in the present invention are bovine collagen I/III matrix (Immedex, France) and other matrices such as Permacol&trade; and various uncross-linked or cross-linked versions thereof, available from Tissue Science Laboratories (UK), and Antema&reg; from Opocrin S.p.A. (Italy) and various universities and institutes. In one embodiment, the matrix has two smooth surface sides, or one smooth surface and one textured or rough surface. A smooth surface on the matrix typically impedes tissue ingrowth, while a textured or rough surface typically promotes cell ingrowth. The surface properties of the matrix may be altered by slowly adding an alcohol, such as ethanol (in a 10-30% solution) in the lyophilization mixture as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/467,584. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the consistency of the matrix is fleece-like, and is formed by treating it with one or more cross-linking agents. Cross-linking us also accomplished by heating or subjecting the composition to radiation. The resulting properties of the matrix will vary, but the matrix preferably has a strength in the range of 0.1 to 20 kp, and most preferably in the range of 1.5 to 5 kp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the crosslinking agent is an aldehyde-based biocompatible crosslinking agent or a polyvalent aldehyde, such as glutaraldehyde. Also, the crosslinking agent can be a bifunctional agent with two moieties reacting with the support matrix and its components. Examples of the moieties are aldehydes; ketones; acetals; half acetals; moieties which are available for oxidative coupling, such as phenolic groups; quinones, such as flavoids; carboxylic groups; and activated carboxylic acids. Also, ethyl-dimethyl-aminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC) may be used as a crosslinking agent. Preferred crosslinking agents are chemical compounds containing two aldehyde groups, such as bioflavonoid or cyanidanol, which promote crosslinking by bridging lysine residues on Type II collagen. The type of crosslinking agent to be used is determined by evaluating its effect on the consistency and physical properties of the matrix and its physiological compatibility with the area of the body in which the matrix and cells are to be implanted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> By the term protein scaffold, it is meant an inter-linked, fibrous texture supporting structure such as a three dimensional porous structure comprised of structural proteins. Examples of acceptable scaffold-forming proteins for the present invention include hydrophobic non-glycosylated proteins such as elastin, either in soluble or insoluble form, or elastin-like peptides. Elastin-like peptides include peptides isolated by partial exhaustive hydrolysis of elastin or soluble elastin with different types of elastases, such as pancreatic sputum. In one embodiment of the present invention, the protein reinforced matrix according to the present invention has cells (such as chondrocyte cells) grown thereon to form an implantable article for implanting in animals for repair of an injury or defect, such as cartilage damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Chondrocyte cells, which may be autologous or homologous, can be cultured and/or retained on the protein reinforced matrix for use in the treatment of cartilage defects in joints. Chondrocyte cells can be grown directly on the support matrix in standard dishes and/or loaded onto the matrix before use. In use, the chondrocyte cell-loaded protein reinforced matrix, i.e., an implantable article, according to the present invention, preferably is introduced into the joint through an arthroscope, or by minimally invasive or open joint surgery technique. The implantation method of the invention also contemplates the use of suitable allogenic and xenogenic chondrocyte cells for the repair of a cartilage defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The cell-loaded protein reinforced matrix is incorporated into various other techniques for effecting or stimulating repair of a bodily defect or damage using various placement and securing devices for implantation. Certain of these techniques and devices are shown in the U.S. patent application of Behrens et al. entitled &ldquo;METHODS, INSTRUMENTS AND MATERIALS FOR CHONDROCYTE CELL TRANSPLANTATION,&rdquo; Ser. No. 09/373,952, filed Aug. 13, 1999; in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/096,597, filed Aug. 14, 1998; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/146,683, filed Aug. 2, 1999, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention teaches methods and systems for the effective repair or treatment of defects in articular cartilage and bone; osteochondral defects; skin and wound defects; and defects of ligaments, menisci, and vertebral discs. These methods and systems involve the use of an implantable article comprising a protein reinforced matrix of the present invention along with cells, such as chondrocyte cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For these purposes, the reinforced matrix of the present invention has a sufficient physical integrity such that it holds a stable form for a period of time to be manipulated for its intended purpose. This strength allows for the growth of cells on the reinforced matrix both before transplant and after transplant, and to provide a system similar to the natural environment of the cells to optimize cell growth differentiation. Over time, perhaps within two to three months, the reinforced matrix is expected to be resorbed in a body of a patient receiving the implant without leaving any significant traces and without forming toxic degradation products. The term &ldquo;resorbed&rdquo; is meant to include processes by which the reinforced matrix is broken down by natural biological processes, and the broken down reinforced matrix and degradation products thereof are disposed, for example, through the lymphatics or blood vessels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">General Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the reinforced matrix of the present invention is prepared by the following method. Six pieces, each approximately 1 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in size of a collagen membrane are incubated with a suspension of elastin in the range of 0.1 mg/100 ml to lOOg/100 ml in a suitable buffer, such as phosphate buffer. The final concentration of elastin in the membrane is between 0.1 mg/100 g to 50 g/100 g. Elastin for use in the present invention is available from EPC, Inc. (USA), specifically sold under the following product numbers: E60, ES60, F65, E61, ES61, E70, ES70, SB77, SB87, SP46, SC55, MT65, ME15, LK215, KE57, K267, ES12, TB872, AE17, BE73, AC27, RA50, MT60, SH476, HA587, HS395, HL457, and HT754. In a preferred embodiment, the phosphate buffer is KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4. </subscript></highlight>Acceptable pH ranges for the mixture are between about 4.0 and 9.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Incubation is performed with suspensions, colloidal dispersions or solutions of a scaffold protein, such as elastin, in different buffers (for example 0.2 m Tris pH 8.8 with 0.1% NaN<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or 0.02M KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, pH 7.4) at temperatures between 1 and 102&deg; C. with concentrations of the protein between 0.5 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The above mixture is allowed to coacervate, such as soak, incubate or mix, for 0.05 to 80 hours, preferably about 2 to 8hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The suspension is then lyophilized to obtain a solid. An acceptable temperature range for lyophilization is between about 20&deg; C. and about 60&deg; C., preferably at about 25&deg; C. and at a pressure of about 0.01 to 10 mbar. Lyophilization may be repeated after soaking the product in an aqueous solution, such as with between 10-20 ml of distilled water. The amount of water used will depend upon the size of the lyophilized collagen pellet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Lyophilization yields a fleece-like material which is then pressed mechanically into sheets for use with cells as an implantation article. The fleece-like material is pressed for a time period of one minute to 48 hours at a pressure of 500 to 1000 grams, preferably at a pressure of 750 grams. A suitable pressing machine for the matrix contains two non-textured stainless steel pieces with bonding material implanted in the pieces. The material is pressed until a sheet-like material that resists tearing upon being handled is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> depict an exemplary pressing apparatus which is in the form of two parts and is similar to a mortar <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and pestle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the pressing apparatus is a stainless steel device with a mortar-like receptacle of approximately 2.5 cm diameter into which a stainless steel pestle-like stamp exactly fits. The matrix material is placed in the mortar-like part and the pestle-like stamp is inserted into opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to apply a mechanical pressing force on the matrix. The pressing device may be any suitable device with enough weight to continually apply force to the matrix. The pressing device preferably is made of stainless steel; however, metals and other materials, for example, plastic, glass, or ceramic, may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Mechanical strength of a reinforced matrix according to the present invention, optionally with cells such as chondrocytes grown thereon, is tested by using an in vitro system to study the behavior of the chondrocytes when in contact with the reinforced material. The strength of the chondrocyte-seeded reinforced matrices was then tested against chondrocyte-seeded commercial matrices. In particular, the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a preferred method to measuring mechanical strength of the seeded chondrocyte matrices. In use, a reinforced matrix <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> produced according to the present invention is attached to two smooth clamps <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Clamp <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is attached to an immovable surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A calibrated caliper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (Ericsen, model number 391-100 II) is attached to clamp <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Caliper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a display dial <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that displays a measure of mechanical resistance at least in the range of 0 to 15 kp. Mechanical strength of reinforced matrix <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is obtained by applying a pulling force on caliper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and observing the level of mechanical resistance reinforced matrix <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> sustains before tearing or breaking down. This in vitro method tests the point of mechanical breakdown of the matrices and predicts the ability of certain materials to mechanically withstand the arthroscopic procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, chondrocytes are grown in culture medium containing one or more suitable buffers and approximately 5 to 7.5% autologous serum in an incubator at 37&deg; C. After a suitable period of time, for example 1 to 14 days, cells are removed from culture and assessed for viability before placing them directly on top of the reinforced matrix material and dispersed over the surface of a cell culture tray. The reinforced matrix is then tested for strength characteristics as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Certain aspects of the instant invention will be better understood as illustrated by the following examples, which are meant by way of illustration and not limitation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Approximately 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>of the chondrocytes in 5 ml of the culture medium were placed directly on top of the carrier material and dispersed over the surface. The plate was incubated in a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>incubator at 37&deg; C. for three days. After this period the chondrocytes were arranged in clusters and started to grow on the carrier. The chondrocytes could not be removed from the carrier by rinsing it with medium or even by mechanically exerting mild pressure on the matrix. At the end of the incubation period the medium was decanted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Mechanical resistance of the seeded membrane was tested manually under standard conditions by using a calibrated caliper such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to test the point of mechanical breakdown of the fleece. In this example, the breakdown of the membranes occurred at an average traction of 5.4 kp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The remaining pieces were incubated with cold refrigerated 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing 0.1 M sodium salt of dimethylarsinic acid. The matrix was stained with Safranin O for histological evaluation. </paragraph>

Tension was continuously recorded with a qualified gauge. Tensile force at which tearing occurred was recorded. The force was detected to be between 3 and 12 kp depending on the lyophilization conditions, the amount and the properties of the added elastin or elastin-like peptides. Commercially available collagen I/III membranes (Geistlich, CH or Tissue Sciences Laboratories, UK) tore between 1 and 6 kp. </paragraph>
