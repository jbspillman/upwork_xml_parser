<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wheel-support rolling bearing unit, which is used for rotatably supporting vehicle wheels on suspension devices, and also a method for manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The vehicle wheels are supported on the suspension devices by the wheel-support rolling bearing unit. A wheel-support rolling bearing unit is known which structured not using nuts for firmly coupling the hub and the inner ring for the purposes of cost reduction by reducing, the number of the number of component parts, and the size and weight reduction, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei.11-129703. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference> show the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> disclosed in the publication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The conventional wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an outer ring <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for supporting the wheel is formed at a portion of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is located closer to the outer end of its outer peripheral surface (the word &ldquo;outer side or outside&rdquo; means the outer side of the vehicle body as viewed in the widthwise direction in a state that the unit is assembled into the motor vehicle, and the left side in those figures except <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>. The word &ldquo;inner side or inside&rdquo; means locations closer to the center of the vehicle body as viewed in the widthwise direction, and the right side in those figures except <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>.). A first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer surface of a middle portion of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> whose outside diameter is small is formed at the inner end thereof. The inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fit to the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and fastened by a caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed directly in the outer surface of the middle portion of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and sometimes is formed in the outer surface of a separate inner ring fit to the middle portion of the hub. In the later case, a portion of the end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is protruded to the inner side as viewed in the axial direction beyond the separate inner ring, serves as the stepped part which receives the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To this end, a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is used for forming the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, is formed in the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A thickness of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes small toward its top end before the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is expanded, for caulking, outward in the diameter directions. Accordingly, a tapered hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed in the inner end face of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The inside diameter of the tapered hole becomes small toward a recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To expand, for caulking, the top end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to fasten the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is forcibly pressed against the top end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a state that the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed so as not to shift in the axial direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. An outward curved portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, shaped like a truncated cone, which may be thrust into the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is formed in the central portion of the end surface (left end surface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) of the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An inward curved portion or recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed surrounding the outward curved portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A cross section of the recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is configured to have a complex curved surface whose radius of curvature becomes small toward the outside so that a cross section of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is formed by plastically forming the top end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, gradually reduces in size from the base end to the top end, and abruptly reduces at the top end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By pressing the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the outward curved portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the recess <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are shaped and have dimensions as mentioned above, against the top end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the top end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is forcibly expanded outward in the diameter directions for caulking, to thereby form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is firmly held between the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> formed at the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, whereby the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fastened to the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A first outer raceway <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a second outer raceway <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed in the inner surface of the outer ring <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The first outer raceway <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer peripheral surface of the middle portion of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while being confronted with the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The second outer raceway <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed while being confronted with a second inner raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed in the outer peripheral surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A plurality of rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, while being rollably held within an element holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, are located between the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the first outer raceway <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A plurality of rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, while being rollably held within an element holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, are located between the second inner raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the element holder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated instance, the rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are balls; however, in the case of the wheel-support rolling bearing unit for motor vehicles which is heavy, those may be tapered rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To assemble the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into the motor vehicle, the outer ring <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fixed to a suspension device with a second flange <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> formed on the outer peripheral surface of the outer ring <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the wheel is fixed to the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As a result, the wheel is rotatably supported on the suspension device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For a work to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by plastically deforming (expanding for caulking) the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to form the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus constructed and operated, it is preferable to use a swing press <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The swing press <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made up of a force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a holding tool <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In forming the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by expanding for caulking the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is displaced in a swing manner while pushing upward the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the aid of the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In a state that the center axes of the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are inclined at an angle &thgr; with respect to each other, the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned about the center axis of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while being in contact with each other. In forming the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by the swing press as just-mentioned, a part of the circumference of the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is pressed against the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that the caulking expanding work of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> continuously progresses in part in the circumferential direction. For this reason, in forming the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by ordinary forging process, a load acting on the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be reduced during the forging process. The holding tool <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> prevents the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from moving in the radial direction during the caulking expanding work of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A technique that in the above structure, a portion of the outer peripheral surface of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, cross hatched in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is quenched to be hardened to improve the durability thereof, is also disclosed in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei.11-129703. Specifically, the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> portion, the base end portion of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the half of the base end portion of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are quenched to increase hardness of those portions to about Hv550 to 900. On the other hand, the hardness of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which will form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is decreased to about Hv200 to 300 so that the cylindrical portion is easy to be plastically deformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Of those cross hatched portions to be quenched, the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> portion receives a great surface pressure upon contact of it with the rolling surfaces of the rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is hardened order to secure a rolling fatigue lifetime. The base end portion of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is hardened in order to prevent the base end portion from being deformed independently of a moment load receiving from the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to which the wheel is fastened. The half of the base end portion of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is hardened in order to prevent the outer peripheral surface of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from being deformed independently of a fitting pressure of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a radial load that the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives from the plurality of rolling elements <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or to prevent the fretting from occurring on the outer peripheral surface of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> where it receives the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> fit thereto. The step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> portion of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is hardened in order to prevent the step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from being deformed independently of an axial directional load acting on the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by caulking work to be described later, to prevent the fretting from occurring on the step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as a contact surface where it comes in contact with the outer end surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and to prevent a corner R as a continuous portion where the outer peripheral surface of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> continues to the step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from being deformed as the result of the stress concentrated thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei.10-95203, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the outside diameter of a portion of the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is protruded beyond the fitting portion of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is somewhat smaller than the outside diameter of the fitting portion. Specifically, a stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having a height H of about 0.02 to 1 mm is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the base end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed on the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at a location closer to the second inner raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> than a slanted surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is formed at the inner end opening of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The slanted surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is held down by expanding radially outwardly the diameter-reduced portion of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for caulking. When the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is radially outwardly expanded for caulking, the bending of it starts at the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. With provision of the expanding work, excessive force hardly applies to the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during the caulking expanding work. As a result, the expanded portion for caulking is little damaged, for example, cracked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned structure will possibly realize a small and light-weight wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at low cost. However, to secure the sufficient durability, reliability and cost reduction of the resultant product, it is necessary to increase the production yield by making the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for fixing the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) free from damage, e.g., cracking. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> show an embodiment of the present invention. One of the characteristic features of the invention resides in a structure which prevents the deformation and wear of the respective parts and prevents part of the hub from being damaged, for example, cracked. Other structure than the above structure and a method of manufacturing the same are similar to those in the conventional technique shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</cross-reference>. Therefore, description to follow will be given placing emphasis on the structure essential to the invention and those portions different from the conventional technique. Like reference numerals are used for indicating like or equivalent portions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</cross-reference>, for simplicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> There is a modification of the above-mentioned embodiment that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer peripheral surface of a separate inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is fit to the middle of a hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(as a hub body), while not directly and integrally formed in the outer peripheral surface of the middle portion of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In this modification, a portion of it, which is protruded inward in the axial direction, at the end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, beyond the inner ring of this separate inner ring, is used as a stepped part to which the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>), which forms a wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the embodiment, is made of carbon steel. A surface portion (cross hatched in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of the hub including a stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to which the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fit is quenched to be hardened (hardness of this portion is increased to about Hv550 to 900). The quenched portion includes not only the half of the base end of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> but also a region ranging from the first inner raceway <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> portion to the base end portion of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is formed on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical portion lob, which is provided on the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereby the base end (the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) of the cylindrical portion is large in diameter and the top end (the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is small in diameter. The stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a height H of about 0.02 to 0.12 mm. The stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a curved surface arcuate in cross section, and is smoothly continuous in shape to at least the small-diameter portion (the outer peripheral surface of a portion of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>closer to its top end). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the case of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which forms the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the invention, crystal particles of the carbon steel of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>portion (not quenched, and located on the right side of a chain line a in the figure) for forming a caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is used for fastening the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are 0.012 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or smaller (it is 0.012 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> case) in an average cross sectional area before the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The average cross sectional area of the crystal particles of the carbon steel, which forms the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>portion, is set to have a predetermined value by adjusting a time from an instant that the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed by forging till it is cooled down to normal temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the case of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forming the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the instant embodiment, a portion of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which extends from the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and beyond the same, is not quenched. The quenched portion, cross-hatched in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, terminates a position closer to the base end of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>than the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (close to the step surface <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the left side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the carbon steel, which forms the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the middle portion and the portion closer to the top end of the cylindrical portion lob, is in a green or half green state, and much softer than the quenched portion, cross hatched (its hardness is about Hv200 to 300). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thus constructed, the surface portion including the portion of the stepped part <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> located closer to its base end is hardened by quenching process. Accordingly, this surface portion is prevented from being deformed or damaged (e.g., worn) Further, in the embodiment, the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, Therefore, when the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is radially and outwardly expanded for caulking, damage, e.g., crack, is hardly formed in the expanded portion in the caulking work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the average cross sectional area of crystal particles, which form the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, is selected to be within 0.012 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, formation of damage, e.g., crack, in the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is effectively prevented when it is formed by radially outwardly expanding the cylindrical portion lob. An experiment on this was conducted by the inventor. This will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the experiment, two types of samples (as being blank hubs) were used each consisting of 100 samples, totally 200 samples. In one type of samples, the crystal particles of the carbon steel forming the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>were <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>012</bold></highlight> mm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in average cross sectional area, and in the other type of samples, those particles are 0.050 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in average cross sectional area. The cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was expanded for caulking for each sample. Inspection was made as to if the resultant caulking portions <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of those samples have defects. No defect was found on all of those samples each having the average cross sectional area of 0.012 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(inspection passing rate&equals;100%). 40% of the samples each having the average cross sectional area of 0.050 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>were defective (passing rate 60%). It the experiment, it was confirmed that if the average cross sectional area of the crystal particles of the carbon steel of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is set to be small, a chance of making the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> defective is effectively eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The portion extending from the middle portion of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and beyond its top end, which is the portion extending from the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and beyond the same, is not quenched. Therefore, the portion extending from the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and beyond the same is more effectively prevented from being damaged, for example, cracked in the caulking expanding work. In other words, in the caulking expanding work, the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> portion is reliably plastic-deformed radially outwardly, and will tightly contact with the inner peripheral surface of the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The operation and effects of this will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is coupled with the first example of the conventional first structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</cross-reference>, and the conventional second structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is quenched. In this case, damage, e.g., crack, is likely to occur on the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is expanded outward in the diameter directions for caulking. Specifically, when the hardened layer, cross hatched in the figure, reaches to the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> portion is hard to be plastic deformed when the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is expanded for caulking as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. As a result, a groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed and left in the outer peripheral surface of the base end of the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> at a portion corresponding to the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. Crack or the like is easy to be formed and its formation starts from the groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Turning to the embodiment, the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not quenched. Therefore, the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is easy to be plastically deformed, so that the groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference> is not formed. Particularly, in the embodiment, the height H of the stepped part <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is small, 0.12 mm. Accordingly, there is no chance of forming groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which will cause the crack. Thus, the invention produces not only the cost reduction by decreasing the number of component parts but also the increase of production yield, which is caused by the reduction of a defective article rate in the manufacturing stage. As a result, the cost of manufacturing the wheel-support rolling bearing unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is satisfactorily reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an one example of a manufacturing method for a wheel-support rolling bearing unit according to the present invention will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a longitudinal sectional view showing a key portion of the wheel-support rolling bearing unit and a state that the inner end of the hub is expanded for caulking by use of a swing press. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, detailed descriptions, as to components or structures which are substantially equal to or functionally coincided with them shown in the aforementioned embodiment, are eliminated by utilizing. the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A more preferable work to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A protruded support <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, circular in cross section, is provided at the central portion of the upper surface of a bottom plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which forms a swing press <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed along the circumference of the upper surface of the protruded support <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. A receiving tool <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is placed within a space enclosed with the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The top end face (upper end face) of the receiving tool <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is thrust against the recess end face of a recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is formed in the central portion of the outer end surface of a hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to which a circular hole formed in the wheel as a vehicle wheel is fit is formed on the outer end surface of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided within the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The inside diameter of the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is equal to or somewhat larger than the outside diameter of the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The inside diameter of a peripheral wall <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is equal to or somewhat larger than the outside diameter of a first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is formed along the peripheral surface of the outer end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, in a state that the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is set in the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in order to form the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on and along the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the outer peripheral edge of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is located close to and confronted with the inner peripheral surface of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is located close to and confronted with the inner peripheral surface or the cylindrical guide <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. And in this state, the top end face of the receiving tool <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> placed on the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is thrust against the recess end face of the recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is formed in the central portion of the outer end surface of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is set to within the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a holding tool <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fixed to the opening of the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to which the inner ring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fit are prevented from moving in the radial direction. In this state, the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is displayed in a swing manner while pushing upward the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(it is made to make a swing motion, like a precession, at an angle &thgr;). The center axis &agr; is inclined at &thgr; with respect to the center axis B of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, a part of the circumference of the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with a part of the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as viewed in the circumferential direction, which is formed on the inner end (upper end in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is expanded for caulking in the radial direction while continuously moving this contact portion in the circumferential direction, whereby a caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed by expanding the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this way for caulking, a thrust load acting on the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which is based on the mutual pressing of the force piston <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is received by the holder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the receiving tool <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> being interposed therebetween. It never happens that a large thrust load acts on the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, since the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the outer end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is fit to the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in a state that it is displaceable in the axial direction. Accordingly, the outer surface of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which may serve as a mounting surface on which the wheel and the disc rotor are mounted after the caulking portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner end of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the swing caulking, will not be inclined with respect to a phantom plane, which is orthogonal to the center axis of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> For this reason, if a required mounting accuracy of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the outer surface of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the disc rotor is secured, both side surfaces of the disc rotor will not be inclined with respect to the phantom plane, which is orthogonal to the center axis of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the judder, which occurs when the vehicle running at high speed is braked, can be reduced to zero or considerably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With regard to the judder, if the outer surface of the first flange <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inclined and both the side surfaces of the disc rotor mounted on this outer surface is inclined with respect to the phantom plane, which is orthogonal to the center axis of the hub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a violent vibration, called judder, occurs when the vehicle running at high speed is braked. Such a vibration makes the driver uncomfortable, and accordingly, should be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> While there has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claim all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As seen from the foregoing description, the present invention is constructed and operated as described above, the invention provides a wheel-support rolling bearing unit which is low in weight and cost, and excellent in durability. </paragraph>
