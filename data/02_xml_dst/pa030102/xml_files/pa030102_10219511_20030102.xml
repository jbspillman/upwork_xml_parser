<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A laser diode is disclosed, in which a laser diode for emitting the beams of a long wavelength and another laser diode for emitting the beams of a short wavelength are sequentially stacked upon a submount, thereby minimizing the gap errors and the position errors for the light emitting points. That is, the distance between the light emitting points can be minimized, and therefore, unlike in the conventional techniques, a separate additional optical component is not required. Accordingly the adjustment of the optical axis is rendered easier, and therefore, the yield is increased, while the assembling cost can be curtailed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a laser diode which emits two-wavelength beams. Particularly, the present invention relates to two-wavelength a laser diode in which a laser diode (LD) for emitting the beams of a long wavelength and another laser diode for emitting the beams of a short wavelength are sequentially stacked upon a submount, thereby minimizing the gap errors and the position errors for the light emitting points. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, the laser beams which are used in the CD (compact disk) are infrared beams having a wavelength of about 780 nm, while the laser beams which are used in the DVD (digital video disk) are the red visible light having a wavelength of about 650 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Among the laser diodes which use such laser beams, the laser diodes for reproducing the DVD-ROM and the CD-ROM include: a semiconductor laser for emitting a single wavelength; and a semiconductor laser for emitting two wavelengths as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGs. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the case where two laser diodes are used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the two laser beams of different wavelengths which are emitted from two laser diodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are merged at a prism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and focused at a objective lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The laser beams which are focused by the objective lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are reflected from disk <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and then, the read again by a photo diode <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>in the case where one laser diode emitting laser beams having two wavelengths is used, a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A for emitting two wavelengths is formed into a single unitized unit, so that a separate prism <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> would not be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the laser diode which emits laser beams having a single wavelength includes: an n type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a contact electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed on the bottom thereof; an n type AlGaInP cladding layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> stacked upon the substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; an InGaP active layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a light emitting point and stacked upon the n type AlGaInP cladding layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>; and a p type InAlP cladding layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having a contact electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and stacked upon the InGaP active layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, whereby a laser diode is formed through a p-n junction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the unitized two-wavelength laser diode is roughly classified into: a monolithic type and a hybrid type as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The monolithic type laser diode is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,999,553. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the monolithic type laser diode is constituted as follows. That is, two laser diodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which are mounted on a submount <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and which have different wavelengths respectively are consolidated upon a substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the gap error range of light emitting points <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If the gap between the two light emitting points is sufficiently small, then the two sets of the laser beams can be focused onto a light receiving part PDIC. Accordingly, the cost for the light pickup can be curtailed, and therefore, the error range of the light emitting points becomes an important factor for the manufacture of the laser diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The error range of the light emitting points is decided by the processing error of the semiconductor photo lithography process, while the height of the light emitting points <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A is decided by the film thickness during the growth of the crystals. Meanwhile, the horizontal positions of the light emitting points are decided to the positions to which the ridges A of the semiconductor laser are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, in the above described monolithic type laser diode, the two laser diodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed upon the same substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and they are electrically isolated from each other by etching. Therefore, if a defect occur in one of the laser diodes, then the whole two-wavelength laser diode becomes defective. Further, the two laser diodes have to be grown twice sequentially at the same conditions, and therefore, there is a high probability that the degradation of the characteristics occurs, while the manufacturing cost rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the hybrid type laser diode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>two laser diodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> having different wavelengths are separatedly formed upon a substrate, and therefore, the product cost will not be increased. The laser diodes of the different oscillation wavelengths are independently formed, and these are installed on a submount <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a two-wavelength laser diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this hybrid type laser diode, however, the two laser diodes have to be separated by a certain distance, and their light emitting points have to be separated from the ridge by a certain distance, these being the requisite of the laser diodes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a separation of at least 150 &mgr;m or more is given to the gap between the light emitting points <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A (the separation distance for the independent action plus the separation distance for preventing degradation of the characteristics), with the result that the drift of the beams is liable to become high. Further, the separation distance between the two light emitting points becomes large compared with the monolithic type laser diode (in which the dispersion errors can be inhibited). Further, the dispersion occurs due to the mechanical errors during the installation of the diodes on the submount. If this dispersion of the light emitting points becomes large, then there are required two photo diodes, with the result that the manufacturing cost rises. Further, in this case, a separate adjusting means is required also at the receiving part. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail referring to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a side view showing a preferred embodiment of the two-wavelength laser diode according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the electrode formation in the two-wavelength laser diode according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The two-wavelength laser diode according to the present invention includes: a submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>; a first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> formed upon the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for emitting the beams of a short wavelength; and a second laser diode formed upon the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, for emitting the beams of a long wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which emits the beams of a short wavelength of 650 nm is constituted as follows. That is, an n type AlGaInP first cladding layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is stacked upon an n type GaAs first substrate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and an InGaP first active layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is stacked upon then type AlGaInP first cladding layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. an AlGaInP second cladding layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and an n-GaAs first blocking layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are stacked on the first active layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Further, a p type GaAs cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is stacked upon the first blocking layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and a first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is formed in the first active layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, for emitting the beams of a short wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which emits the beams of a long wavelength of 780 nm is constituted as follows. That is, an n type AlGaAs third cladding layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is stacked upon an n type GaAs second substrate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and an AlGaAs second active layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is stacked upon the n type third cladding layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A p type AlGaAs fourth cladding layer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and an n-GaAs second blocking layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are stacked upon the second active layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and a p type GaAs second cap layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is stacked upon the second blocking layer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Further, a light emitting point <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is formed in the second active layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, for emitting the beams of a long wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, first and second electrodes <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> supply electric currents to the first active layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which emits the beams of a short wavelength, and these first and second electrodes <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are stacked on the top of the first cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and on the bottom of the first substrate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further, third and fourth electrodes <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> supply electric currents to the second active layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which emits the beams of a long wavelength, and these third and fourth electrodes <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> are stacked respectively on the bottom of the second substrate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and on the top of the second cap layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of a short wavelength of 650 nm is generally used for reproducing the DVD-ROM, and the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a long wavelength of 780 nm is used for reproducing the CD-ROM. The first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are attached on the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by using adhesive means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are made of a metal Au&mdash;Sn, Sn, In) or an epoxy resin. In this case, the first and second light emitting points are positioned on a vertical axis which is perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The separation between the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> should be preferably 50-150 &mgr;m, and therefore, a separate adjusting component is not required unlike in the conventional method in which a separate adjusting component is required because the gap between the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> cannot be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> On the bottom of the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, there can be formed a heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for dissipating the heat which is generated by the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is attached on the bottom of the submount through a third adhesive layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is made of a metal or an epoxy resin so as to improve the thermal conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, on the top of the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, there is stacked the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the wavelength of 650 nm, which has a relatively low thermal conductivity and which generates a large amount of heat in the relative terms. In this manner, the heat which is generated from the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be effectively removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, in order to more effectively remove the heat from the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the first cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is installed adjacently to the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> That is, the distance from the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the first cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shorter than the distance from the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the first substrate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Therefore as described above, the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is disposed immediately upon the top of the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and adjacently to the heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the heat generated from the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be easily dissipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the above case, the distance between the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is about 3-50 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to electrically isolate the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from each other, there is formed an insulating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Owing to this insulating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the first and second laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be driven in a mutually electrically isolated manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a side view showing another preferred embodiment of the two-wavelength laser diode according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> p type layer, i.e., a p type GaAs first cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacently to a p type GaAs second cap layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Further, an n type GaAs first substrate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacently to the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Except the above described structure, this second embodiment is exactly same as the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this constitution, the distance between the first cap layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shorter than the distance between the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the first substrate <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Further, the distance between the second cap layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and the second light emitting point <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shorter than the distance between the second light emitting point <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the second substrate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the distance between the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the second light emitting point <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Further, the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are positioned on the same vertical axis which is perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the submount <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and therefore, the distance between the two points is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, the distance between the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> should be preferably 50-150 &mgr;m, and the distance between the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be more minimized in this embodiment than in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a separate adjusting component is not required unlike the conventional technique in which a separate adjusting component is required because in it the distance between the two points cannot be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The first and second laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are attached together by a first adhesive layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>like in the first embodiment, while an insulating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is disposed between the first and second laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to electrically isolate them from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The laser diode of the present invention constituted as above will now be described as to its action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the two-wavelength diode according to the present invention is capable of reproducing two disks, i.e., a DVD-ROM disk and a CD-ROM disk, because there are a first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of a wavelength of 650 nm and a second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a wavelength of 780 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In each of the laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, if a voltage is supplied to the p-n junction where the cladding layers of the first and second active layers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are stacked, then an electric current flows. Under this condition, the electrons of the n region and the holes of the p region move toward the opposite regions to form reunions, with the result that induced emissions occur. Owing to the induced emissions, light beams of different wavelengths are emitted from the first and second light emitting points <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the first and second active layers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> That is, the first light emitting point <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> emits light beams of a wavelength of 650 nm, while the second light emitting point <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> emits light beams of a wavelength of 780 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, the light beams of the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have a relatively shorter wavelength, and therefore, a relatively large amount of heat is generated from it. Therefore, the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is installed adjacently to the heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the distance between the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be minimized, thereby effectively dissipating the heat from the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> owing to an efficient thermal conduction from the diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the heat sink <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the second laser diode <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a wavelength of 780 nm is unitizingly attached onto the first laser diode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of a wavelength of 650 nm through the first adhesive layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being made of an epoxy resin. The first and second laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are electrically isolated from each other by an insulating layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and their electrodes are connected to an external power source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, if a power is supplied, the first and second laser diodes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> respectively emit two sets of light beams of different wavelengths in which the position errors are minimized. Therefore, without employing a separate light receiving device, a DVD-ROM disk and a CD-ROM disk can be read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention as described above, a laser diode having a short wavelength and another laser diode having a long wavelength are unitizingly stacked upon a single submount. Therefore, the distance between the light emitting points can be minimized, and therefore, unlike in the conventional techniques, a separate additional optical component is not required. Accordingly the adjustment of the optical axis is rendered easier, and therefore, the yield is increased, while the assembling cost can be curtailed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, a heat sink is installed adjacently to the laser diode of the short wavelength, and particularly, the p type layer of the laser diode of the short wavelength is made nearer to the heat sink. Accordingly, the distance between the heat sink and the light emitting point of the laser diode of the short wavelength can be minimized, and therefore, the heat which is generated from the laser diode of the short wavelength can be efficiently dissipated. As a result, the deterioration of the product quality can be prevented, and consequently, the life expectancy of the product can be extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the above, the present invention was described based on the specific preferred embodiments and the attached drawings, but it should be apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be added without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention which will be defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
