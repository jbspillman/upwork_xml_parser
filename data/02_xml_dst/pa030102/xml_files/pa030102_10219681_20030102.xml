<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to glycidylester compositions, to a process for their preparation, to coating compositions and other curable compositions comprising the glycidylester compositions, and to cured products obtained by using the indicated curable compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Coating compositions based on the reaction products of 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane and epichlorohydrin are known. The cured products prepared on the basis of these compositions are resistant against hydrolysis, however, they show a low ultraviolet resistance and are therefore not suitable for applications requiring a high degree of outdoor durability such as building parts or automotive topcoats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Triglycidylesters which can be used in outdoor durable coatings and in moulding compositions are disclosed in European Patent Application No. 447360A (EP-A-447,360). The application discloses the product having high levels of hydrolyzable chlorine content. In example 2 of EP-A-447,360 which relates to the glycidation of the 2:1 adduct of hexahydrophthalic anhydride and dimethylolpropionic acid, the product obtained has a hydrolyzable chlorine content of 1.0% (10,000 mg/Kg). Such a high level of residual chlorine is generally undesirable in coating compositions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (ii) a curing compound selected from the group consisting of amino resins blocked or unblocked (cyclo)aliphatic isocyanates, alpha,alpha&prime;-dibranched cyclic anhydrides, acid-functional polyesters containing only alpha,alpha&prime;-dibranched acid and ester groups, (cyclo)aliphatic amines, (cyclo)aliphatic polyamino amides, blocked or unblocked Lewis acids, and teritary amines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The molar ratio of compounds (a) and (b) was preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 2.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferred reactants (a) are selected from diglycidyl ester of diethyl malonic acid, 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl adipic acid, sulphodipivalic acid and tetrapropyl adipic acid and preferred reactants (b) are selected from diethylmalonic acid, 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl adipic acid, sulphopivalic acid and tetrapropyl adipic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated from the European patent application and other publications, referred to therein, that only very specifically structured diglycidyl esters of alpha,alpha&prime;-dibranched dicarboxylic acid could be used as reactant in coating compositions that show a combination of acceptable hydrolytic stability, resistance of transesterification and acceptable weathering resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> International Application WO 96/11238 shows that epoxy resins containing cycloaliphatic nuclei have the disadvantage that they could only provide brittle coating films when cured. This brittleness made them unsuitable for coating applications, as brittleness often led to poor adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> European patent application No. 0634434 A2 describes a process for the preparation of linear tertiary aliphatic carboxyl functional polyester resins, by reacting: </paragraph>

The linear tertiary aliphatic carboxyl functional polyesters were reacted with an excess epihalohydrin in the presence of a suitable base and optional catalyst to produce polyglycidylester resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The European patent application No. 0720997A2 describes certain linear tertiary carboxyl functional polyesters and epoxy functional polyester resins. These polyester resins were obtained by reaction of: </paragraph>

The solution was charged to a 3 litre glass reactor equipped with a temperature control, stirrer and reflux condenser. Next, the temperature was raised to 75-85&deg; C., followed by the first gradual addition of an aqueous solution of 0.17 moles NaOH over a period of time of 20 minutes. After an additional reaction period of 50 minutes the reactor content was cooled to 55&deg; C. in 30 minutes, followed by the second gradual addition of an aqueous solution of 0.94 moles NaOH over a period of time of 60 minutes. After an additional reaction period of 5 minutes the reactor content was allowed to settle and the aqueous phase was separated from the organic phase. </paragraph>
