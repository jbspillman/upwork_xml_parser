In an embodiment, the wireless device is used to obtain a fingerprint of the individual wanting to make a purchase. The wireless device then transmits the fingerprint to a device coupled to a cash register, which sends the fingerprint to a third party verification service. The third party verification service uses the received fingerprint to verify the identity of the purchaser by matching the received fingerprint to fingerprint data stored in a database. The identity of the purchaser can then be sent to the cash register and to a credit service.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a piezoelectric identification device and applications thereof. More particularly, it relates to a piezoelectric device for obtaining biometric information, such as a fingerprint, and using the obtained information to recognize and/or identify an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Biometrics are a group of technologies that provide a high level of security. Fingerprint capture and recognition is an important biometric technology. Law enforcement, banking, voting, and other industries increasingly rely upon fingerprints as a biometric to recognize or verify identity. See, <highlight><italic>Biometrics Explained, </italic></highlight>v. 2.0, G. Roethenbaugh, International Computer Society Assn. Carlisle, Pa. 1998, pages 1-34 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Optical fingerprint scanners are available which detect a reflected optical image of a fingerprint. To capture a quality image at a sufficiently high resolution, optical fingerprint scanners require at minimum optical components (e.g., lenses), an illumination source, and an imaging camera. Such components add to the overall cost of a fingerprint scanner. Mechanical structures to maintain alignment also increase manufacturing and maintenance costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Solid-state silicon-based transducers are also available in fingerprint scanners sold commercially. Such silicon transducers measure capacitance. This requires the brittle silicon transducers to be within a few microns of the fingerprint sensing circuit reducing their durability. To detect a rolled fingerprint, the sensing array of the solid-state transducer needs to have an area of 1 inch&times;1 inch and a thickness of about 50 microns. This is a big geometry for silicon that increases the base cost of a fingerprint scanner and leads to greater maintenance costs. Durability and structural integrity are also more likely to suffer in such a large silicon geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> What is needed is an inexpensive, durable fingerprint scanner with low maintenance costs. What is also needed is a low cost biometric device that can protect the individuals and the general populace against physical danger, fraud, and theft (especially in the realm of electronic commerce). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A wireless transceiver device is used to conduct a secure electronic sales transaction. In an embodiment, the wireless device is used to obtain print identification data from an individual wanting to make a purchase. The wireless device then transmits the print identification data to a device coupled to a cash register, which sends the print identification data to a third party verification service. The third party verification service uses the received print identification data to verify the identity of the purchaser by matching the received print identification data to print identification data stored in a database. The identity of the purchaser can then be sent to the cash register and to a credit card service. The credit card service uses the data from the third party verification service to approve sales information received from the cash register and to prevent the unauthorized use of a credit card. It is also envisioned that the credit card would be a virtual function as its physical characteristics can be replaced by wireless transmission of its data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, print identification data for an individual wanting to make a purchase is received from a wireless transceiver device by a merchant. The merchant sends this print identification data to an identity verification service. In addition, the merchant also sends transaction data about the purchase to a credit card service. After sending this data, the merchant obtains verification data about the individual&apos;s identity and authorization to make the purchase using a particular credit account. The merchant uses this obtained data to make a determination whether to complete the purchase. In an embodiment, the merchant uses a receiver coupled to a cash register to receive the print identification data from the wireless transceiver device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the invention, the print identification data obtained from an individual can include, for example, hand or palm prints, fingerprints and/or thumb prints. This print identification data can be captured, transmitted and/or stored, for example, as a bit map, grayscale image data, 10-pixel-per-millimeter bilevel data and/or 20-pixel-per-millimeter bilevel data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the print identification data is obtained from the individual using an identification device having a piezoelectric sensor. In an embodiment, the piezoelectric sensor includes a piezo ceramic sensor array. The invention is not limited, however, to using a piezo ceramic sensor array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the print identification data is obtained from the individual using a wireless transceiver biometric device. In embodiments, this device can obtain biometric data in addition to hand or palm prints, fingerprints and/or thumb prints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the invention, the merchant obtains verification data about the individual&apos;s identity from the identity verification service, and the merchant obtains verification data about the individual&apos;s authorization to make the purchase using the particular credit account from the financial service. In other embodiments, the merchant obtain the verification data from the credit card service. In this embodiment, the verification data from the credit card service is based, in part, on data that the credit card service received from the identity verification service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, print identification data for an individual wanting to make a purchase is received by an identity verification service from a merchant. This print identification data and the credit account data are obtained by the merchant from the individual using a wireless transceiver device. The received print identification data is compared to print identification data stored in a database. In this embodiment, the results of the comparison are sent to a credit service in order to permit the credit service to make a determination about the individual&apos;s authorization to use a particular account. The results of the comparison may also be sent to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to make a determination about whether to complete the purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, data about the identity of an individual wanting to make a purchase from a merchant is received by a credit service from an identity verification service. The received data is based, in part, on a comparison of print identification data for the individual to print identification data stored in a database. In this embodiment, the print identification data for the individual is obtained by a merchant from the individual using a wireless transceiver device and sent to the identity verification service by the merchant. Transaction data about the purchase is received by the credit service from the merchant. After processing the received data, the credit service sends data to the merchant about the individual&apos;s authorization to use a particular credit account to make the purchase. The data sent to the merchant by the credit card service is based, in part, on the data received from the identity verification service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is an advantage of the invention that it can be used to reduce credit fraud. Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a piezoelectric identification device and applications thereof. More particularly, it relates to a piezoelectric device for obtaining biometric data or information, such as a fingerprint, and using the obtained information to recognize and/or verify the identity of an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> II. Example Devises and Systems According to the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a piezoelectric identification device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. Identification device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a piezoelectric sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a sensor input signal generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a sensor output signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The input signal generated by input signal generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is coupled to sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by two multiplexers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The output signal of sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is similarly coupled to output signal processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by two multiplexers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A. Piezo Ceramic Sensors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably an array of piezo ceramic elements. For example, sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can comprise an array of polycrystalline ceramic elements that are chemically inert and immune to moisture and other atmospheric conditions. Polycrystalline ceramics can be manufactured to have specific desired physical, chemical, and/or piezoelectric characteristics. Sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is not limited to comprising an array of piezo ceramic elements, however. Sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can comprise, for example, a piezoelectric film. A polarized fluoropolymer film, such as, polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) film or its copolymers can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the operating characteristics of a single rectangular piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. When force is applied to surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a voltage proportional to the applied force is developed between surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. When this occurs, surfaces <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> move away from one another. When a voltage is applied to surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, surfaces <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> move towards one another, and surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> move away from one another. When an alternating voltage is applied to surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> oscillates in a manner that would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a row of five rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>D, and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>E. Each of these rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is attached or integral to support <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Support <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> inhibits the movement of one surface of each rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, when an alternating voltage is applied to surfaces <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C, a sonic wave is generated at surface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the generated sonic wave is dependent on the physical characteristics of piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a two-dimensional array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be made from lead zirconate titanate (PZT). PZT is an inexpensive material. In an embodiment, array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is similar to a PZT <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> composite used in medical applications. The piezo ceramic elements of sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the invention can have shapes other than rectangular. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can comprise an array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of circular piezo ceramic elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> comprises rectangular piezo ceramic elements that are 40 microns square by 100 microns deep, thereby yielding a 20 MHz fundamental frequency sonic wave. A spacing of 10 microns is used between elements in this embodiment in order to provide a 50-micron pitch between elements. A pitch of 50-micron enables an identification device according to the invention to meet the Federal Bureau of Investigation&apos;s quality standards for fingerprints. Other embodiments of the invention use geometries different than the preferred embodiment. In one embodiment, a size for a piezo ceramic sensor is 19 mm by 25 mm which is still a relatively low cost and durable sensor. In another example, a pitch of less than or greater than 50 microns can be used. Other embodiments also operate at frequencies less than or greater than 20 MHz. For example, embodiments can operate at frequencies of 30 MHz and 40 MHz, in addition to other frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the spacing between the elements of a sensor array according to the invention can be filled-in with a flexible type material or filler <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to suppress any shear waves and give the sensor improved mechanical characteristics. Micro-spheres <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> can be added to the filler <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> (e.g., vinyl micro-spheres) to reduce weight and/or increase the suppression of shear waves. In order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of an identification device, and the device sensitivity, fillers (e.g., araldite filled with air filled vinyl micro-spheres) that provide high acoustical attenuating and electrical isolation should be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> At least five fabrication methods exist for producing array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. These methods include: laser cutting, dicing, molding, screen-printing, and ink jet printing. Laser cutting involves using an excimer laser to cut small groves and thereby form the elements of array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Dicing involves using high performance dicing equipment to form groves and the elements of array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Molding involves using injection molding equipment to form array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Screen-printing is a technique similar to that of solder printing in the assembly of printed circuit boards, where highly automated screen printing machines are adapted with laser cut stencils. This method is particularly suited to producing 20 MHz sonic wave elements since the ceramic elements are only 100 microns thick. This method involves producing a ceramic slurry of appropriate consistency, and has the advantage of not requiring surface grinding as may be required with the molding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates a sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> comprising rectangular piezo ceramic elements according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. Sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is a multi-layer structure that includes a two-dimensional array of rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, similar to array <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Conductors (such as conductors <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>) are connected to each of the rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The conductors connected to one end of each element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (e.g., conductor <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>) are oriented orthogonal with respect to the conductors connected to another end of each element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (e.g., conductor <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>). A shield layer <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> can be added to one side to provide a protective coating where a finger can be placed proximate to sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. A support <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> can be attached to the opposite end of the sensor array. Sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> B. Piezo Film Sensors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> illustrates a sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> comprising piezoelectric film (piezo film) according to an embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. Sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is a multi-layer structure that includes a piezoelectric layer <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> sandwiched by two conductor grids <highlight><bold>754</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight>. Conductor grids <highlight><bold>754</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight> each consist of rows of parallel electrically conductive lines. Preferably, the lines of grid <highlight><bold>754</bold></highlight> are oriented orthogonal with respect to the lines of grid <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight> (that is, in x and y directions, respectively). This orientation creates a plurality of individually addressable regions or elements in the piezo film. As used herein, the term element refers to any region of a sensor array that can be addressed, either individually or as part of a larger region, using the rows of parallel electrically conductive lines (conductors). Piezoelectric polymer film sensors are further described in <highlight><italic>Piezo Film Sensors: Technical Manual, </italic></highlight>available from Measurement Specialities, Inc. Norristown, Pa., Apr. 2, 1999 REVB (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Shield layer <highlight><bold>758</bold></highlight> can be added to one side where a finger is placed to provide a protective coating. Foam substrate <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> can be used as a support. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the multiple layers of sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> are stacked along one direction (e.g., a z-direction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, piezo layer <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> is a polarized fluoropolymer film, such as, polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) film or its copolymers. Conductor grids <highlight><bold>754</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight> are silver ink electrodes printed on opposite sides of the PVDF film <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight>. Shield layer <highlight><bold>758</bold></highlight> is made of urethane or other plastic. Foam substrate <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> is made of TEFLON. An adhesive <highlight><bold>762</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> holds shield layer <highlight><bold>758</bold></highlight> and foam substrate <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the printed PVDF film <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the PVDF film, including the printed electrodes, can be peeled off like a label for easy replacement. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> can be mounted by adhesive <highlight><bold>766</bold></highlight> onto wax paper or other material (not shown) for easy peel off. This allows the piezo sensor to be installed and/or replaced simply and easily at minimum cost. Compared to optical and silicon technologies, maintenance of the piezo sensor array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is trivial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> C. Sensor Array Address Lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a more detailed view of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. As described above, sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> comprises piezo ceramic elements having an filler <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Filler <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> preferably contains micro-spheres <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. This structure is then sandwiched between several layers. This central composite layer is an active structure that can be used, for example, to map fingerprint mechanical impedances into a matrix of electrical impedance values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Each rectangular piezo ceramic element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is connected to two electrode lines (e.g., conductors <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>). The electrode lines on one end of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> run perpendicular to the electrode lines on opposite end of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Thus, any single element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the array can be addressed by selecting the two electrode lines connected to it. The electrode lines are preferably created by vacuum despoliation and lithography, and they are connected to the switching electronics via an interconnect technique described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> On top of the one set of electrode lines is a protection layer <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Protective layer <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is preferably made of urethane. This protecting layer is intended to be in contact with a finger during operation of the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A support <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> or backing layer serves as a rear acoustical impedance for each of the rectangular piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, support <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is made of TEFLON foam. In order to provide a large variation of the electrical impedance of an element when loaded and unloaded, the acoustical impedance support <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> should be acoustically mismatched to the sensor element material. Either a very low or a very high acoustic impedance material can be used. For embodiments using piezo ceramic materials, the preferred impedance mismatch can be obtained by an air backing rather than by a hard backing. This is because the sensor has a high acoustic impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The materials described herein for constructing sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> are illustrative and not intended to limit the present invention. Other materials can be used, as would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art given this description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates how sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> can be connected to an application specific integrated circuit. As described herein, an individual piezo ceramic element (m, n) of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> can be addressed by selecting (addressing) conductor m on the top of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and conductor n on the bottom of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Other conductors can be either grounded or open (high impedance state), particularly those conductors used to address elements in the neighborhood of the element being selected, in order to reduce cross-talk. Parasitic currents in the neighborhood of the selected element are minimized mechanically by the interstitial filler <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, described above with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>A. Since in the preferred embodiment, the spacing between elements (pitch) is about 50 microns and standard bonding technologies require a pitch of about 100 microns, alternate rows on an &ldquo;East&rdquo; and &ldquo;West&rdquo; and alternate columns on a &ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;South&rdquo; sides of sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, connect the sensor to the &ldquo;outside world&rdquo;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, These conductors can be terminate in a &ldquo;Bump&rdquo; technology around three edges <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> of an ASIC multiplexer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, side <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> of ASIC multiplexer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is about 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, ASIC multiplexer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is connected to a high density flex <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. High density flex <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> is connected to an epoxy substrate <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Conductors can be formed or attached to the high flex to couple the conductors of the array to ASIC multiplexer <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>.

Sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is coupled to input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> by multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B, respectively. A controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> controls the operation of multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> B. The operation of identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> comprises an input signal generator or oscillator <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, an variable amplifier <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, and a switch <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, oscillator <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> produces a 20 MHz signal, which is amplified to either a low or a high voltage (e.g., about 4 volts or 8 volts) by variable amplifier <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, depending on the mode in which device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is operating. Switch <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> is used to provide either no input signal, a pulsed input signal, or a continuous wave input signal. Switch <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> is controlled to produce the various types of input signals described herein in a manner that would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the input signal generated by input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is provided to sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, through multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A, and to controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> and output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> illustrate how to apply an input signal generated by input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> to the sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, and how to receive an output signal from sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> comprises 200,000 elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> arranged in a two-dimensional array (i.e., a 500&times;400 element array). The 500 conductors of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> that connect, for example, to the element rows on the bottom of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> must be connected to input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, either one at a time or in various groupings, while the 400 lines that connect to the columns on the top of the array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> must be connected, for example, to an impedance meter or Doppler circuit, either one at a time or in various groups. This task is accomplished by multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> are incorporated into four identical ASICs (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). These four ASICs comprise analog multiplexers, amplifiers, detection circuits, and logic. In a preferred embodiment, the voltage of the input signal to sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is restricted to less than 8 volts, which permits the ASICs to be constructed using 3-micron geometry, and to attain a switch impedance of less than 5 ohms. The four basic sections of each of these ASIC are: (1) multiplexers as described herein; (2) amplifier/automatic gain controllers; (3) Doppler detectors; and (4) a digital signal processor (DSP) interface. The structure and implementation of items (2) through (4) are known to persons skilled in the relevant art given this description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> comprise seventeen 16:1 multiplexers, thus giving one output or 16 outputs as selected. The function of each switch in the multiplexer is determined by a shift register <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> that is 272 bits long and 2 bits wide (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>). The loading and clocking of shift register <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is performed by controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, which comprises a counter and logic that would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the conductors of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> can be connected to either ground, signal input generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, or they can be unconnected (high impedance). Multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A is designed for lowest &ldquo;on&rdquo; resistance. Multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B connects all (256) conductors of one side of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> to one or sixteen sense nodes. Both multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B are connected to the same function logic (i.e, controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>) so that the proper sensor elements are selected and used, for example, for voltage sensing. Element columns and rows, in the neighborhood of an element or group of elements selected for sensing, can be switched to ground to prevent coupling and interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> illustrates how to control the switches of multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. As described herein, each switch of multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> connected to a conductor of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> can be in one of three states: connected to ground, connected to signal input generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, or open (high impedance). This can be implemented, for example, using two CMOS gates, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. A 272 bit long by 2 bit wide shift register can then be used to control the position of each switch. Bits from controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> are shifted into shift register <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> to control the position of the switches of multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, shift register <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is coupled to the switches of multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> using latches so that the position of the multiplexer switches remain constant as new bits are being shifted into shift register <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. How to implement this embodiment would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art. Other means for implementing the functionality of multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates an example voltage detector <highlight><bold>1244</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. As will be understood by a person skilled in the relevant art, the voltage drop in each conductor of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is large compared to the voltage drop of the elements of the array because all the elements coupled to a particular conductor are drawing from a signal source (i.e., input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>). If each element has an impedance of 500 ohms, the impedance of 400 elements connected in parallel is 1.25 ohms. This situation can be compensated for, however, by using a second multiplexer to measure the true output voltage of the elements. As can be see in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, multiplexer <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> is used to move the virtual zero-point of the amplifier <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> before the switch of multiplexer <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As explained herein, the choice of apertures, their relative position in sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, and the number of apertures intended to be operated simultaneously will affect the complexity of the logic of for multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, this logic is implemented using a DSP. The mode of operation of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can be selected on the four identical ASICs described above using mode switches. These mode switches can be used to operate switches <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) to direct the output of multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> B to the proper detector of output signal generator <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Circuits to implement the functionality of these detectors will be known to persons skilled in the relevant art given their descriptions herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The output of output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> is biometric data. This data can be stored in memory <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> using memory controller <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a method according to an embodiment of the invention. Use of this biometric data is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates means for increasing scanning speed and minimizing cross-talk in a sensor array <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, multiple elements can be active simultaneously and a first means for minimizing cross-talk is to separate geographically the active elements <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> of array <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. As explained herein, a dynamic grounding scheme (i.e., coupling the elements <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> in the neighborhood of an active element <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> to ground) can be used that moves with the active elements <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> as they scan across the sensor array <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. This reduces the capacitive coupling to ground and electrical cross-talk while maintaining a Faraday Cage for all sensed frequencies. In addition, an interstitial filler can be used to reduce cross-talk and thereby the parasitic currents in the neighborhood of the selected elements <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>. Other elements of array <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>, e.g., elements <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight>, are connected to conductors that are open. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a method <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. Method <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> comprise two steps <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, a biological object, for example, a finger or a hand, is place proximate to a piezoelectric ceramic array. In step <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>, an output is obtained from the sensor array. The obtained output is processed as explained below to obtain biometric data that can be used to recognize or verify the identity of a person, whose finger or hand, for example, was placed proximate to the sensor array. Each of the steps <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight> are described further below with regard to the various operating modes of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As described herein, identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is operated in different modes depending on the biometric data to be obtained. The biometric data that can be obtained using device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes fingerprints, bone maps, arteriole blood flow, and/or capillary blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates using identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to obtain a fingerprint of a finger according to an embodiment of the invention. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> is place proximate to the sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is similar to piezo ceramic sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Two fingerprint ridges <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> are in direct contact with protective shield <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. A fingerprint valley (i.e., cavity) <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> is not in direct contact with protective shield <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, there are approximately six piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> between the adjacent fingerprint ridges <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Initially, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is in a power saving mode. This mode is particularly useful for prolonging battery life in mobile versions of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. When finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> applies a force to sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, a wake-up circuit <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) operates to turn-on device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Wake-up circuit <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> comprises a capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, a diode <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>, and a switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight>. When finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> applies a force to piezo ceramic elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a voltage is developed by the elements causing capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> to accumulate a charge. When enough charges has been accumulated, the voltage so produced causes switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> to be turned-on. Voltage source <highlight><bold>1808</bold></highlight> is used to power device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> once switch <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> is turned-on. Power will continue to be supplied to device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> until capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> is discharged using a turn-off circuit (discharging resister not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> After device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> wakes-up, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can be operated in either an impedance detection mode or an attenuation mode (voltage mode) in order to obtain an output from sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> that can be processed to obtain the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. Each of these modes are explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The outputs of the elements of piezo sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be summed to determine the centroid of the point of contact of the finger with the device. Any movement of the finger across the device can thus be sensed and the sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be used as a pointing device. For example, the centroid of a finger in contact with piezo sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be used to point on interconnected viewing devices. The sum of the sensors elements can also used to determine if the user is pressing with too little or two much force and the result fed back to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> can also be used as a switch to make a selection on an interconnected viewing device. For example, if an analog-to-digital converter (not shown) is coupled to capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, the voltage across capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> is converted to a digital signal that can be used interactively to make the selection by a user. As a user varies the pressure applied to sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the voltage across capacitor <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> will vary. The analog-to-digital converter converts this time varying voltage, for example, to a series of numbers between 00000000 (base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and 11111111 (base <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The output of the analog-to-digital converter is periodically sampled and used to make and/or indicate a selection (e.g., the number can be input to a processor and used to make and/or indicate a particular selection). A graphical user interface on a viewing device provides feedback to the user and indicates to the user which of the possible selections is being selected by the user based on the pressure applied to sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. To change a selection, the user simply applies either more or less pressure to sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

At a frequency of about 19.8 MHz, the impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint valley is approximately 800 ohms. At a frequency of 20.2 MHz, the impedance is approximately 80,000 ohms. At a frequency of 20 MHz, the impedance is approximately 40,000 ohms. As can be seen when <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is compared to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, both the absolute impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint valley and the change in impedance with frequency of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint valley is significantly different from that of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint ridge. This difference can be used to obtain an output from sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> that can be processed by output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> to produce fingerprint data. </paragraph>

As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, at a frequency of about 19.8 MHz, the impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint ridge is approximately 2,000 ohms. At a frequency of 20.2 MHz, the impedance is approximately 40,000 ohms. At a frequency of 20 MHz, the impedance is approximately 20,000 ohms. Thus, both the absolute impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint ridge and the change in impedance with frequency of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint ridge is significantly different from that of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded with a fingerprint valley. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When operating in the impedance mode, identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> determines the absolute impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or the change in impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with frequency to determine whether a given element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is loaded by a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> or a fingerprint valley (cavity) <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight>. To obtain a measure of the impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is used to produce low voltage pulses that are input to the elements of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> using multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A. The output signals obtained at multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B are related to the absolute impedance of the elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. These output signals are routed by switch <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> to impedance detector <highlight><bold>1242</bold></highlight> to determine a measure of the absolute impedances of the elements of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. To obtain a fingerprint, it is only necessary that impedance detector <highlight><bold>1242</bold></highlight> be able to determine whether a given element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is loaded by a fingerprint ridge or a fingerprint valley. These determinations of whether a particular element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is loaded by a fingerprint ridge or fingerprint valley can be used to generate pixel data that represents the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. The fingerprint is stored in memory <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>. The fingerprint can also be transmitter to other devices as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> If the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> is scanned twice using two different input signal frequencies, the change in the impedances of the elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with frequency can be calculated. As already described herein, the change in the impedances of the elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with frequency is different depending on whether an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is loaded by a fingerprint ridge or fingerprint valley. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the input signal generated by input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is supplied to output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. Thus, output processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> can determine both the frequency and the voltage of the signals being input to sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> An impedance detector circuit (not shown) can be implemented using an op amp. The output of multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B is supplied to the negative port of the op amp and an amplified signal is obtained at the output port. As would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art, the positive port of the op amp is coupled to ground and a resistance is placed between the negative port and the output port of the op amp. If the amplified voltage at the output port exceeds a predetermined threshold voltage, the particular element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> being measured is loaded by a fingerprint ridge. This is due to the fact that the absolute impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint ridge (for a given frequency) is approximately half of the impedance of an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a finger print valley. Thus, the voltage of the output signal provided to the op amp from an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint ridge is approximately twice the voltage of the output signal provided to the op amp from an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint valley. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> B. Attenuation/Voltage Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As stated above, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can also operate in an attenuation or voltage mode to obtain the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. This mode of operation is available whether sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is a piezo ceramic array (e.g., array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>) or a piezo film array (e.g., array <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>). The attenuation mode of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is based on the principle that energy imparted to an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> can be transferred to finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, while energy imparted to an element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> loaded by a fingerprint valley <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> cannot be transferred to finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the attenuation mode, input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> produces a high voltage, pulsed signal that is provided to the elements of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> using multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates a one-cycle input pulse. An input signal is typically longer than one-cycle, however. In an embodiment, an input signal is about ten-cycles long. These input signal causes the elements of the array to vibrate and produce sonic waves. These sonic waves can travel from an element through the shield layer to a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> above the element. These sonic waves can pass into a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> because the acoustic impedance of the shield layer is matched to the acoustic impedance of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. No acoustic barrier to the sonic waves is formed by the interface between a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> and the shield layer. The energy imparted to an element loaded by a fingerprint ridge is thus dissipated. In the case of an element loaded by a fingerprint valley, the energy imparted to an element remains trapped in the element for a longer period of time. This is because the air in the fingerprint valley acts as an acoustic barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> After a number of cycles, the voltages of output signals obtained for the array are determined and processed to obtain the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates an example output signal. In an embodiment, since the energy imparted to an element loaded by a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> is dissipated more quickly that then energy imparted to an element loaded by a fingerprint valley <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight>, the voltage of an output signal obtained from an element loaded by a fingerprint ridge <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> is only about {fraction (1/10)}th of the voltage of the input signal. In this embodiment, the voltage of an output signal obtained from an element loaded by a fingerprint valley <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> is about &frac12; of the voltage of the input signal. This difference in voltages can be detected by voltage detector <highlight><bold>1244</bold></highlight> and processed to generate the fingerprint of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. A means for implementing voltage detector <highlight><bold>1244</bold></highlight> is described above. Other means will be known to a person skilled in the relevant art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> C. Doppler-shift and Echo Modes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can be operated in at least two other modes. These modes are signal time of travel (echo) mode and Doppler-shift mode. Echo mode can also be referred to as imaging mode. These modes are used to obtain biometric data such as bone maps, arteriole-veinal maps, arteriole blood flow and capillary blood flow, as described below. Combinations of these biometrics and/or others can also be obtained. For example, a ratio of arteriole blood flow to capillary blood flow can be obtained and used to indicate the emotional state or well-being of a host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> illustrates how an identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> operating in echo or Doppler-shift mode can be used to obtain biometric information according to embodiments of the invention. As described herein, a high voltage signal can be input to the elements of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> to produce sonic waves. These sonic waves travel through finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> and are reflected by various features of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, such as, for example the bone of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, the fingernail of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, or the blood flowing in finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> illustrates how an identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is used to obtain a three-dimensional bone map according to an embodiment of the invention. To generate a map of a bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is operated in its echo mode. Sound waves traveling from the skin surface into finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> will be reflected from the bone structure of bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>. This structure can be identified from the large echo amplitude that it causes. Since the echo travel time is a measure of the sensor to bone distance, a three-dimensional map of the shape of bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> To obtain a map of bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>, a high voltage, pulsed input signal is generated by input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and provided to the elements of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. This input signal causes the elements to generate sonic waves that travel into finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, only certain elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> are actively generating sonic waves at any given time. In accordance with the invention, and as described herein, active sonic wave transmitting and receiving apertures are configured and moved (scanned) across sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> using controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> and multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>. The generated sonic waves travel through finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> and are reflected by the structure of bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight>. These reflected sonic waves are then detected by the receiving apertures. The time of travel of the sonic waves are obtained by detector <highlight><bold>1246</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> and used to detect whether bone structure is located at a various distances from array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. As would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art, this mode of operation is similar to how radars operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The wavelength of the sonic waves and the aperture selected define the transmit and receive beam shape. Various aperture sizes and beam directivity can be formed in accordance with the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> illustrates a example beam directivity that can be used to obtain a bone map of bone <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the invention. Other beams can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> illustrates how identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is used to obtain arteriole blood flow information according to an embodiment of the invention. An artery <highlight><bold>2602</bold></highlight> and capillaries <highlight><bold>2604</bold></highlight> are shown for finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, arteriole blood flow is parallel to the surface of sensory array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Arteriole blood flow data is obtained from device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> while it is operating in Doppler-shift mode. To receive a Doppler-shift signal back-scattered from red blood cells flowing in artery <highlight><bold>2602</bold></highlight>, the transmit and receive directivity beam patterns of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> must form one or more overlapping volumes <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> illustrates a transmitting aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>A and a receiving aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>B according to an embodiment of the invention that form an overlapping volume <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight>. One approach for creating transmitting apertures <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>A and receiving apertures <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>B is to make the apertures less than about six wavelengths square (e.g.,. 300 microns or six elements on a side) and spaced at a pitch of two wavelengths (600 microns). These apertures create side beams or grating lobes at about 30 degrees and form overlapping regions <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight> at a depth appropriate for detecting arteriole blood flow. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> illustrates a transmitting and/or receiving beam formed by such apertures according to an embodiment of the invention. Other apertures can also be used. The angle at which grating lobes can be created are controlled by the ratio of the pitch between apertures and the wavelength of the sonic waves generated, as would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art given the description of the invention herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</cross-reference>, sonic energy produced by aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>A is scattered by blood cells flowing in artery <highlight><bold>2602</bold></highlight> and received at aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>B. The input signal provided to the elements of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> that make up aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>A is a high voltage, continuous wave signal. This input signal is also provided to output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> as a reference signal for Doppler-shift detector <highlight><bold>1248</bold></highlight>. This input or reference signal is mixed by Doppler-shift detector <highlight><bold>1248</bold></highlight> with the output signal received from aperture <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>B to obtain Doppler shift information. Circuits for implementing Doppler-shift detector <highlight><bold>1248</bold></highlight> are known in the relevant art, and thus not reproduced here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> illustrates how an identification device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is used to obtain capillary blood flow information according to an embodiment of the invention. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, capillary blood flow is in a direction normal to the surface of sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. To separate the capillary flow from the arteriole flow, multiple apertures of nine elements (3&times;3, 150 micron square) can be selected. This aperture will create a very small and close area of sensitivity that can be replicated in many parts of sensor <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> simultaneously. The sensitivity of the apertures can be increased by adding the Doppler signals of multiple apertures together. The sensitivity apertures is focused in the first half millimeter of finger <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> closest to the surface of array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates a transmitting and/or receiving beam directivity that can be used to detect capillary blood flow according to an embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> When using device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to detect blood flow, using a pulsed Doppler embodiment has the advantage of having the same aperture perform both the transmit and receive functions. In addition, by gating the received signal, only back-scattered information resulting from a well-defined sample volume is analyzed to obtain the blood flow pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a more detailed method <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> for obtaining biometric data using device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Method <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> is described with reference to a particular embodiment of device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> having a piezo film sensor array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight>, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is awakened and piezo film sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is switched to detect an initial pixel or a group of pixels. Controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> switches multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B to a designated initial pixel or group of pixels. In one example, piezo film sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is a 512&times;512 pixel array. Multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>B are each used to addressed and/or select a particular grid line (conductor) at a designated address of the initial pixel or group of pixels being detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight>, an input signal is applied to piezo film array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. A pulse is applied in one 30 MHZ cycle. Oscillator <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> generates an oscillation signal at 30 MHZ. Multiplexer <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>A forwards the input pulse to an initial pixel or group of pixels. This input signal is also sent to controller <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> and output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>3106</bold></highlight>, an output signal is obtained from piezo film array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. Output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> waits a number of cycles before detecting a signal at the pixel. For example, in response to the signal sent from input signal generator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> waits a number of cycles after the input pulse is applied to the pixel (or group of pixels). In step <highlight><bold>3108</bold></highlight>, when the wait is complete, a voltage, for example, is evaluated using voltage detector <highlight><bold>1244</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> For example, one 30 MHZ cycle corresponds to approximately 33 nanoseconds. The wait can be approximately 5 cycles or 150 nanoseconds. Other wait durations (e.g. a greater or smaller number of periods) can be used depending upon the oscillator frequency and/or other design considerations. This wait allows the ring down oscillation due to the presence of a fingerprint ridge to occur, in response to the applied electrical pulse at the pixel, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>3108</bold></highlight>, a filtered voltage is evaluated by output signal processor <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> and a grey scale or a binary pixel value is output representative of the detected voltage (step <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight>). A filter circuit (not shown) is a band-pass filter that filters the output voltage to detect an output voltage signal in a passband centered about a frequency of approximately 30 MHz. The grey scale or binary pixel value is output to memory controller <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> for storage in image memory <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>. In one example, the output grey scale or binary pixel value is stored in an address in image memory <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the detected pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>3112</bold></highlight>, a check is made to determine if the scan is complete. In other words, a check is made to determine whether each pixel in the 500&times;400 sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> has been scanned and a corresponding output value has been stored and accumulated in image memory <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>. If the scan is complete, then the routine ends. A signal or other indication can then be generated and output from device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> to indicate, for example, that a fingerprint image has been successfully captured. If the scan is not complete, then the piezo film sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is switched to detect the next pixel or next group of pixels (step <highlight><bold>3114</bold></highlight>). Control then returns to perform steps <highlight><bold>3104</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>3112</bold></highlight> at the next pixel or next group of pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As described above, piezo film sensor array <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> can be switched by multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> to detect voltage values at a single pixel or a group of pixels. In general, any pattern for scanning pixels can be used. For example, a raster scan of pixels can be performed. Pixels can be scanned row by row or column by column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In one preferred example, when multiple groups of pixels are read out at a given instant, each pixel in a group of pixels are separated by a predetermined distance. In this way interfering effects from the ring down oscillation in neighboring pixels are minimized or avoided. In one example, pixels detected in a given cycle are separated by a minimum distance of at least <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> pixels. In this way any ring down oscillations between neighboring pixels are attenuated significantly. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, in a step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the transaction, device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is used to obtain a fingerprint of the individual wanting to make a purchase. Device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> then transmits the fingerprint to a device coupled to cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), which sends the fingerprint to a third party verification service <highlight><bold>3604</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The third party verification service uses the received fingerprint to verify the identity of the purchaser (step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) by matching the received fingerprint to fingerprint data stored in a database. The identity of the purchaser can then be sent to cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and to a credit card service <highlight><bold>3606</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The credit card service uses the data from the third party verification service to approve sales information received from cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and to prevent the unauthorized use of a credit card. Once cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> receive verification of the purchaser&apos;s identity and verification that the purchaser is authorized to use the credit card service, cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> can notify device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> to send a credit card number (step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Cash register <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> can then send the credit card number to the credit card service <highlight><bold>3606</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), which then transfers money to the sellers bank account (step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) to complete the sales transactions. These steps are illustrative of how device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> can be used as an electronic signature device, and are not intended to limit the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment for reducing or preventing credit card fraud, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> contains the credit card transaction information that the store requires for a purchase. This data is transmitted to the cash register via a BLUETOOTH piconet. First, the fingerprint image and biological information are transmitted via piconet and Internet to a third party for approval of the transaction, then the credit card transaction information flows from device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> to the store and the credit card company in the normal way. The third party&apos;s function is to guarantee the purchaser&apos;s identity in a transaction to the credit card company, thereby, reducing or eliminating the possibility of fraud. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> E. Other Wireless Transceiver Biometric Device Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> illustrates other applications for which the wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is well suited. For example, device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> can be used for: building access control; law enforcement; electronic commerce; financial transaction security; tracking employee time and attendance; controlling access to legal, personnel, and/or medical records; transportation security; e-mail signatures; controlling use of credit cards and ATM cards; file security; computer network security; alarm control; and identification, recognition, and verification of individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is a low-cost, ubiquitous device that identifies a person and records the signature through both the fingerprint image and biological features such as blood flow. Information is transmitted to the other person(s) engaged in a transaction via a BLUETOOTH wireless network with other devices in the BLUETOOTH networks such as a controller, any type of processor or computer (palm device, PDA, laptop, desktop, server, etc.), set top box, cellular telephone, landline telephone, and/or vehicle (such as an automobile). Wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> transmits authorization functions for physical access and alarm control, ignition control, computer and network access control, e-mail signatures, credit card transactions, cell phone identification, airline transactions and financial enrollment transactions via BLUETOOTH piconets as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> including an embodiment with a piezoceramic sensor has applications within many market segments including but not limited to financial, physical access control, automotive, telecommunications, computers, law and order, health care, immigration and welfare markets. For example, in one financial market segment application, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is used for physical access control for bank employees, cardholder verification and secure transaction certification. In one physical access control market segment application, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is used for automotive access and theft control, garage door, house access and activation of domestic security systems. In one automotive market segment application, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is used as an access and ignition control device. In one computer market segment application, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> interacts in a biometric device for network access control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Finally, in one telecommunications market segment application, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> is incorporated in a telephone. A wireless telephone or landline telephone incorporates at least a sensor array, such as, a piezo ceramic sensor array or piezo electric thin film sensor array according to embodiments of the present invention. In this application, communication and DSP functions can be carried out by the other components in the telephone. In other embodiments, BLUETOOTH is incorporated into both cellular and fixed station telephones for proximal communications. The telephone is then a flexible portal that the consumer will use to assert biometric authorizations and/or identifications according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, one wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> (such as BLUETOOTH device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> with a piezo ceramic sensor) can wirelessly communicate to different types of devices (e.g., computer mice, physical access control units, telephones, palm devices, set top boxes, computers, ATM machines, keyboards, locks, ignitions, etc.) to provide additional biometric-based security so that only an authorized person can be operate the respective devices or gain a desired access or authorization. For example, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> (such as BLUETOOTH device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> with a piezo ceramic sensor) can communicate over a pico net to a telephone to provide additional security so that only an authorized person can be operate the telephone. Similarly, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> can communicate to a remote control device to enhance security relating to the authorized use of set top boxes, televisions, recorders, players or other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, a wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> (such as BLUETOOTH device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> with a piezo ceramic sensor) is incorporated into any type of device where additional biometric security is desired. For example, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> can be incorporated in a telephone to provide additional security so that only an authorized person can be operate the telephone. Similarly, wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> can be built in a remote control device to enhance security relating to the authorized use of set top boxes, televisions, recorders, players, or other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> These are just a few of the many useful application of device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> in particular, and the present invention in general. Additional applications for device <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> and the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts given the description of the invention herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> F. Personal Area Network Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> As described herein, embodiments of the invention are capable of interacting with other devices as part of a personal area network. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> according to the invention. Device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> comprises a biometric device similar to device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, described above, a DSP chip <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight>, a BLUETOOTH chip <highlight><bold>3804</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>3806</bold></highlight>, and a battery <highlight><bold>3808</bold></highlight>. As described above, device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> has a piezo ceramic sensor array <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and four multiplexers <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight> according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Biometric device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is coupled to a DSP <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight>. DSP <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight> controls device <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> and stores biometric data. DSP <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight> is also coupled to BLUETOOTH chip <highlight><bold>3804</bold></highlight> for sending and receiving data. A display <highlight><bold>3806</bold></highlight> is used to communicate information to a user of device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> is powered by a battery <highlight><bold>3808</bold></highlight>. As would be known to a person skilled in the relevant art, BLUETOOTH is an agreement that governs the protocols and hardware for a short-range wireless communications technology. The invention is not limited to implementing only the BLUETOOTH technology. Other wireless protocols and hardware can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> enables an individual to be in communication with compatible devices within about 30 feet of device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> can connect, for example, with to telephones, cell phones, personal computers, printers, gas pumps, cash registers, Automated teller machines, door locks, automobiles, set top boxes, et cetera. Because device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> can connect to and exchange information or data with any compatible device within a personal area network, or pico net, device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> is able to supply a standardized secure identification or authorization token to any device, or for any process or transaction that needs or requests it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> G. Public Service Layer Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a &ldquo;public services layer&rdquo; (PSL) high up in a BLUETOOTH stack. The PSL layer rationalizes identification and access control for BLUETOOTH devices communicatively coupled to each other. In embodiments, the PSL layer supports authorization and identification based on a fingerprint biometric signal provided by a fingerprint scanner. In one example, a wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> can be used with a BLUETOOTH module including a BLUETOOTH protocol stack to provide the fingerprint biometric signal. See, e.g., the description of BLUETOOTH module, protocol stack, and compliant devices by Jennifer Bray and Charles Sturman, <highlight><italic>BLUETOOTH&trade; Connect without Cables, </italic></highlight>Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J. 2001 (entire book incorporated in its entirety herein by reference), and Brent Miller and Chatschik Bisdikian, <highlight><italic>BLUETOOTH Revealed, </italic></highlight>Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J. 2001 (entire book incorporated in its entirety herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, the PSL layer functionality is defined by a protocol (also called a specification). The PSL layer interprets simple requests from devices in the piconet and acknowledges back with capabilities and level of capability in a predefined form. Vendors of BLUETOOTH appliances can add services in the PSL layer of the present invention to enhance the features of their product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The PSL layer, which would in most cases act transparently to the normal function of the device until a PSL request was broadcast that requested one of the functionality groups that the device supported. One minimum level of support re-broadcasts an unsatisfied request in the aid of extending the scatter net to eventually find a device with the requested function. In this way, other devices outside of the range of a requesting device can be contacted to fulfill the PSL request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> is a diagram of an example piconet <highlight><bold>3900</bold></highlight> coupling BLUETOOTH devices <highlight><bold>3910</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Device BLUETOOTH is a fingerprint scanner with a public service layer and BLUETOOTH stack or chipset. The public service layer can support authorization and identification. Device <highlight><bold>3920</bold></highlight> is any BLUETOOTH appliance. Device <highlight><bold>3920</bold></highlight> includes a PSL layer and BLUETOOTH stack or chipset. Piconet <highlight><bold>3900</bold></highlight> can include any number of BLUETOOTH devices within the area of the piconet, within a scatternet, or coupled to the piconet through other communication links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Completing a task may require many functions to be performed in concert among a constellation of distributed BLUETOOTH appliances. The user would have to purchase and install sufficient appliances to cover all the functions in a task. The PSL scheme enables efficiency and cost savings as the appliances would be shared amongst users and in some cases providing multiple uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> One example operation of the PSL layer is physical access control. A PSL layer of wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3920</bold></highlight> sends or broadcasts one or more request access signals. Such request access signals in the PSL layer can include a request for extract/match/access and data representative of detected fingerprint from outside the secured perimeter via BLUETOOTH. The PSL layer in a Desktop PC with BLUETOOTH inside the secured area receives the request from the wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3920</bold></highlight> for extract/match/access and matches the print data to the personnel database which could be stored in a server and sends an access granted to the door. The BLUETOOTH door lock then opens and the task is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The savings are illustrated by; using a desktop PC that is used for other purposes, to perform the function of access control, time and attendance, personnel tracking and security. The only dedicated hardware is the BLUETOOTH door lock as the PC and the wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> are used for other tasks. The installation cost is minimal and the convenience of record keeping and data base management is also minimal. The three appliances involved in this task could be purchased from different vendors who have only communicated to the PSL standard. The function of fingerprint extract/match/access could be pattern, minutiae, local or central or even changed at any time for greater security and convenience etc, without effecting the door lock or wireless transceiver biometric devices <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight>. The turning off or on of say lights, air conditioners, telephones, could all be added to this task if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Another advantage in savings is obsolescence. A building fitted with BLUETOOTH door locks, BLUETOOTH air-conditioning, BLUETOOTH smoke detectors, BLUETOOTH lighting etc. could be upgraded with biometric controls without installation costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Appliances such a smoke alarms and light fixtures can act as alarms and extend pico nets into scatter nets that will bridge gaps in parks, gardens and car parks adding security an functionality to gates in remote areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Telephones could be marketed with BLUETOOTH PSL functionality meaning that they can dial 911 if an emergency code is received. BLUETOOTH PSL could signify functionality to be programmed to dial a specific number for private emergency services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Protocols could be defined which log events in a FIFO so false alarms could be traced and minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the PSL Specification has the elements identified below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> A decimal filing system is included. A request is broadcast for a function that can be as specific as the number of decimal places in the request. In this way a manufacturer can keep the task in his constellation of devices if the devices are available as is expected. If the request is not serviced by the exact function number (FN) required the next nearest FN in the scatter net is used. Clusters of FN are used around areas of development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> For example, a light fixture can have a FN of <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, which indicates <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> a facility utility, <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> a light, <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> a plug in, <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> a table lamp, <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> a halogen low voltage, <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> made by a person or company (not exclusive). A request for this specific function of turning on <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> may be serviced by <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>789</bold></highlight> a wall neon as that is all that is available at the time and the numerically nearest number though limited to the group of 55&times; lighting. The FN <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be defined in the PSL specification, digits after this are for manufacturers uses and may be registered. In this way a lighting manufacturer may supply software for a PC that orchestrates visual effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> A requesting device or a PSL manager (Piconet Master Device) could arbitrate in the scatter net to match requests and functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The PSL can also define the structure of how functions are allocated. A FN allows one to negotiate with vendors of door locks with minimal effort. The PSL also give manufacturers of other appliances insight into task implementation where a wireless transceiver biometric device <highlight><bold>3800</bold></highlight> could play a key roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Function Numbers in the PSL are grouped for request and function suitability in one example as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> Emergency </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> Communications </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Requests and Events can also be used in the PSL specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Off/ON/More/Less are universal requests. User specific requests would not be in the specification. Events such as ACK, NAC, can also be added in the PSL specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Protocols or the structure of the request and acknowledgment include the following features broadcasted in a packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> (a) PSL indicates this packet is a PSL function request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> (b) FUNCTION NUMBER indicates the function requested </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> (c) REQUE indicates the operation to be performed (off/on, lock/unlock) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The PSL specification can but does not need to repeat the BLUETOOTH structure of encryption, error checking et cetera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The following series of examples serve to illustrate the PSL layer in several real-world applications: </paragraph>
