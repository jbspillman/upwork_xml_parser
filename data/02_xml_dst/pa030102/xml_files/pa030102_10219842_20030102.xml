<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to methods for testing semiconductor circuitry for operability. More particularly, the invention pertains to interconnects and methods for fabrication thereof which are suitable for testing circuits of a bare die or multiple dice of an unsingulated wafer substantially without or with minimal &ldquo;crosstalk&rdquo; or other electrical interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the current state of the art, bare semiconductor dice are finding increased use in constructions of multi-chip-modules (MCM) having a large number of dice. MCM are particularly vulnerable to semiconductor die defects, because if only one of the multiple, e.g., 10-30 or more dice, is defective, the module is considered defective and is generally discarded at considerable monetary loss. Thus, for example, if the individual die has a mean acceptance rate of 98.0 percent, a series of MCM, each with 25 dice, would have a predicted overall acceptance rate of about 70 percent, which is unacceptable from the standpoint of production cost and resulting price to the customer. A MCM having a greater number of dice will have a lower acceptance rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In view of requirements for greater reliability of increasingly complex integrated circuits such as are included in (MCM), semiconductor manufacturers now supply bare, i.e., unencapsulated, dice which have been pretested for operability in accordance with a set of specifications. Dice meeting the manufacturer&apos;s test specifications are certified as known-good-die (KGD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Considerable effort has been expended to develop test equipment and methods for accurately testing an individual or discrete semiconductor die to enable KGD certification. For example, apparatus for conducting burn-in tests for a discrete die are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,107 to Corbett et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,891 to Wood et al., both patents assigned to Micron Technology, Inc. Other test apparatus for a discrete die are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,123,850 to Elder et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,117 to Malhi et al., both assigned to Texas Instruments, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,451,165 to Cearley-Cabbiness et al., 5,475,317 to Smith, 5,572,140 to Lim et al., 5,406,210 to Pedder, 5,378,981 to Higgins III, 5,402,077 to Agahdel et al., and 5,565,767 to Yoshimizu et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to test a discrete semiconductor die, temporary electrical connections must be made between the bond pads on a bare semiconductor die and the external test circuitry of the test apparatus using the bond pads of the die to provide the connection points for testing the integrated circuit of the die. Bond pads on semiconductor dice are typically formed of layers of various metals, such as aluminum, copper, nickel, gold, alloys thereof, or solder of various metallurgies. The bond pads of semiconductor die for connections thereto are typically formed in a flat, planar configuration or as a raised bump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The test apparatus for discrete semiconductor dice use various techniques for making a nonpermanent connection to the bond pads of a semiconductor die. The Wood et al. patent shows a die contact member that uses nonbonded TAB (tape automated bonding) technology. The Elder et al. apparatus uses a flexible connection member having an arrangement of probe bumps or members for temporary contact with the wire bond pads of the semiconductor die. The Malhi et al. apparatus uses an arrangement of cantilevered probe tips to contact the bond pads of the semiconductor die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,428 to Farnworth et al., a method for fabricating a probe is disclosed which is used for nonpermanent test contact with a bond pad on a semiconductor die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,517,752 to Sakata et al. discloses a probe provided on a pressure-connector terminal used for TAB and COG connection to the bond pads of the semiconductor die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage of prior art test fixtures for semiconductor die testing, such as probe cards, is that their use often results in electronic interference, i.e., &ldquo;crosstalk&rdquo; between fixture leads, even at what are considered to be moderate frequencies for testing the die. This problem essentially precludes the application of existing test fixtures such as probe cards to the simultaneous testing of multiple bare semiconductor dice. Another problem in testing multiple semiconductor dice in wafer form is that of misalignment and disconnection of contact members from bond pads of dice being tested resulting from a probe card and a wafer containing the dice, each having different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). Thus, each discrete semiconductor die of a wafer or MCM must be separately tested, one at a time, resulting in much greater testing time and expense than are desirable. The need for apparatus and methods enabling rapid testing of multiple bare semiconductor dice is evident. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a shielded raised contact member for nonpermanent connection to a semiconductor die or dice for testing thereof. The invention also comprises methods for fabricating the contact member and interconnects using such fabrication methods. The traces connected to the raised contact members on the interconnect are coaxially covered with a metal layer and an intervening insulation layer such as silicon dioxide. The invention also encompasses an improved multiple contact test device, e.g., probe card for testing a singulated semiconductor die or a plurality of semiconductor dice, for example, in wafer form. The metal shielding substantially prevents or minimizes interference or &ldquo;crosstalk&rdquo; which has, in the past, prevented simultaneous, high-speed testing of multiple semiconductor dice for KGD certification. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate of the test device is formed of the same semiconductive material as the die(s) under test, e.g., silicon, whereby the CTE are matched. Misalignment of contact members with bond pads of the semiconductor die or dice during the connection step and disconnection of contact members of the interconnect from the bond pads during the test (due to temperature change of the probe card and die(s)) is avoided. The present invention further provides for the control of the depth of penetration of contact members with respect to the bond pads of the semiconductor device or the deformation of the bond pads during the connection step.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a prior art raised interconnect as fabricated by a method disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,779 to Akram. This patent, together with commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,326,428 to Farnworth et al. and 5,483,741 to Akram et al., are incorporated by reference herein. The present invention is illustrated as comprising improvements upon the interconnect apparatus disclosed in these references, but is not limited to such constructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the prior art raised interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the interconnect includes a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed largely of a semiconducting (SC) material member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as monocrystalline silicon. The SC material member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a planar outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a material such as silicon oxide formed thereon. The insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be formed using a suitable deposition process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or by exposure of the outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to an oxidizing atmosphere for a short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the prior art, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has raised contact members <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, each formed on a pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the SC material (see cutaway portion). Each contact member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a pillar cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of conductive metal, e.g., aluminum, with a pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of projecting apexes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for temporary intimate conductive contact with a wire bond pad of a semiconductor die. A layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of insulating material such as silicon dioxide is interposed between the SC material of the pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the pillar cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A conductive trace or lead <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> overlies the external surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is connected to the metal pillar cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and to a test circuit for testing a semiconductor die. The number of such interconnects <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on an interconnect, e.g., test card, for testing a bare semiconductor die corresponds to the required number of contacts with wire bond pads necessary for the tests. A test card may be provided, and used repeatedly, for each semiconductor die configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While this prior art interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an improvement over previously used devices, its use, like that of prior devices, may result in interference or &ldquo;crosstalk&rdquo; between adjacent conductive traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, particularly because of coupling at higher frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, electronic and electromagnetic interference between traces and between raised contact members <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is effectively eliminated as a factor in test results by incorporating a metallic shield over each trace and over a major portion of each contact member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of an interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). The metallic shield suppresses coupling between adjacent conductors and other sources of electromagnetic noise, enabling accurate testing under a much wider spectrum of signal strengths and frequencies. Multiple semiconductor dice located on a wafer may be simultaneously tested with a single testing apparatus using the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One method of producing a shielded interconnect of the invention uses method steps of the above-cited, commonly owned patents to form a precursor interconnect which is subsequently modified to provide an improved interconnect. In one embodiment of the present invention, the steps are illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an initial step in forming interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention from a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is depicted using a fragment <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, comprising a first material which preferably comprises a semiconductor. More preferably, the first material constitutes silicon. The first material is preferred to have the same or as nearly the same coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) as the dice to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A layer of second insulating material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided atop the planar outer surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The composition of the second insulating material is selected to be capable of substantially masking the underlying first material from oxidation when the semiconductor substrate is exposed to oxidizing conditions. Where the underlying material, i.e., bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is silicon, the second material may be silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>). A typical thickness for insulating material layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be from about 500 &angst; to about 3000 &angst;, with about 1600 &angst; being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, second insulating material layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is patterned and etched to selectively outwardly expose the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and define an array <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of discrete first material hard masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (i.e., <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>D). Depending on the materials used for the second insulating material layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, this etch step may be performed with a dry etch or wet etch. For example, an insulating material layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of silicon nitride may be etched using hot (e.g., 180&deg; C.) phosphoric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>D are formed in a parallel spaced array <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and are sized and shaped to fit within the perimeters of a generally rectangular or square shaped bond pad of a semiconductor die to be tested, for example, a bond pad of the size of about 100 &mgr;m&times;100 &mgr;m. As is evident, such a parallel spaced array <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is merely exemplary. Other suitable arrangements of the masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> include enclosed rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, T-shapes and X-shapes. Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an alternate array <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>F comprising a pair of generally concentric enclosed rectangles <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>F. It is observed that for the particular arrays <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the cross-sectional views along line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are coincidentally the same (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> wet or dry isotropic or anisotropic etch process is used to form projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>D on the bulk substrate material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For an anisotropic etch, in which the etch rate differs in different directions, an etchant solution containing a mixture of KOH and water may be used. This anisotropic etch results in the formation of triangular tipped apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> as apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>D. This is a result of the differing etch rates of monocrystalline silicon along the different crystalline orientations. For an isotropic etch, in which the etch rate is the same in all directions, an etchant solution containing an aqueous mixture of HF and HNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be used. However, in such an anisotropic etching process, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will not form and, therefore, would not be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in place of etching, the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be subjected to an oxidizing atmosphere to oxidize portions of the substrate not covered by the masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As an example, the oxidizing atmosphere may comprise a mixture of steam and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at an elevated temperature (e.g., 950&deg; C.). The oxidizing atmosphere oxidizes the exposed portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and forms an insulating layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of e.g., silicon dioxide. At the same time, projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed under the masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may also be formed by a deposition process from a material other than the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> form an array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> corresponding to the array <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the masking blocks <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>D are stripped using a wet etchant such as H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>that is selective to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With an oxidizing process, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is stripped using a suitable wet etchant such as HF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the steps of patterning, etching and stripping form projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (i.e., <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>D) which are in the shape of substantially parallel spaced knife edges. The projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> form an array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> projecting from the substrate surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has an overall peripheral dimension which falls within the boundaries of a bond pad on a semiconductor die to be tested. Although drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows multiple knife edges formed for contact with each bond pad, it is to be understood that each raised contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) to be formed may have a single knife edge or multiple knife edges patterned in a wide variety of arrays <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> project from surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and include tips <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and bases <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. If desired, additional etching may be used to sharpen the tips <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> following formation of the apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The bases <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of adjacent projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are spaced from one another a distance sufficient to define a penetration stop plane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> therebetween. An exemplary spacing between apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is about 10 &mgr;m, and the length of an individual stop plane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be, for example, about 3 to 10 &mgr;m. The tip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of each projecting apex <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are spaced apart by a projecting distance preferred to be about one-half the thickness of a bond pad on a semiconductor die to be tested. In this manner, the penetration of each projecting apex <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> into a bond pad of a semiconductor die or the deformation of the material forming the bond pad of a semiconductor die may be carefully controlled along with the amount of force that each bond pad and the active surface of a semiconductor die is subject to during the testing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the next step, illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, all of the projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are covered with a nitride masking layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and photopatterned. As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is etched around the masking layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to form raised contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with pillars <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Typical etching techniques include wet anisotropic etching with a mixture of KOH:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, known in the art as bulk micromachining. The contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are numbered, sized and spaced to contact the desired bond pads of a semiconductor die to be tested. A typical test apparatus will have a large number of contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, a contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may have projecting apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within a planar square of surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of side dimensions of about 40-80 &mgr;m. The array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, i.e., <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B . . . <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>N is dimensioned to fall within the perimeter of a bond pad. The height <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, between the surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the stop plane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the thinned bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is such that all of the finally configured raised contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can readily be connected with accuracy to the bond pads of a semiconductor die. A typical height <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the contact members is about 50-100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The method for fabricating this embodiment further includes the formation of a conductive layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as a metal or metal silicide (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), on the tip of each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the formation of conductive traces or leads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from the contact members to a circuit for testing or other purpose. These steps are illustrated in drawing FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is formed on surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be formed by oxidation of the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, e.g., by exposing the bulk substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to an oxidizing atmosphere for a short time. Silicon dioxide may also be deposited using CVD. Another insulator useful in this insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> comprising polysilicon (doped or undoped), amorphous silicon (doped or undoped), or other silicon is deposited on the insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> by CVD or epitaxial growth process. The silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is required to form a silicide with a metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) during subsequent processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is formed on the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be deposited by CVD or by exposing the layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to an oxidizing environment. The second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is typically about 500-3000 &angst; in thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of photoresist is formed on the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by a spin-on or other deposition process such that the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on the upper portion of each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not effectively covered. After development of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is removed by e.g., etching, leaving the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> exposed on the tip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, including the knife edged apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, penetration stop planes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A and surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A coplanar therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is removed and a metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is deposited on the exposed silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> covers the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on the tip and sidewalls of the contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, including the array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In addition, the metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> covers the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be deposited to a thickness of about 500-3000 &angst; using a deposition process such as low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), sputtering or evaporation techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> reacts with the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to form a metal silicide. Suitable metals include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, and molybdenum, as well as cobalt, nickel, copper, gold and iridium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are sintered at e.g., about 650-820&deg; C. to form a conductive layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of silicide alloy such as TiSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Next, unreacted portions of the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are etched away using known methods. The contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be annealed to reduce the resistivity of the conductive silicide layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Conductive traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of a second metal, polysilicon or other conductor may be formed on the insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to provide a conductive path in electrical contact with the conductive silicide layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 16</cross-reference>, the completed raised contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as fabricated by the prior art method is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Thus far, the described method comprises one method of several known methods for fabricating a contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The following steps comprise a method of fabricating an improvement in the exemplary contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and other contact members in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Turning now to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the method of the invention comprises the step of applying a third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of e.g., silicon dioxide or silicon nitride over the top and sides of conductive metal trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The silicon dioxide third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may also be applied over the lower portion of the pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, i.e., below the array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and including portions of the pillar cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to avoid contact of the silicon dioxide third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> with a bond pad. In fact, the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be applied to the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the exception of the tip portions <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. If so configured, the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will largely overlie the insulating layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. If coated with the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the tip portions <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the raised contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be etched to remove the insulation and expose the conductive pillar caps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The silicon dioxide third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be formed by methods known in the art, e.g., CVD. In one embodiment, portions of the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be etched to remove it from areas not adjacent to conductive traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Following the application and any partial etching of the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is applied over the third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, at least over the portions overlying the traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and portions of the contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> other than the tip portions <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> comprises a shield over each trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and over a substantial portion of each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to greatly reduce, minimize, or eliminate crosstalk and other electronic and electromagnetic interference between traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and between contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may comprise any material which will block high frequency electrical and electromagnetic radiation and may be, for example, aluminum, titanium, tungsten, nickel, silver, molybdenum, copper, or other metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be applied at a thickness of about 500-3000 &angst; using a suitable deposition process such as a LPCVD, a sputtering process, or by evaporation techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, application of the metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is followed by a partial etching step to remove the metal from areas in which the metal will provide little or no advantage. An electrically isolated metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be formed over a trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to provide a coaxial shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may overlie all of the traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and intervening portions of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this latter configuration, the metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, the conductive trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connecting the apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the completed contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to a testing circuit is coaxially covered on the top and sides with a metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and an intervening insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, e.g., silicon dioxide, between the conductive trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is designated as shielded trace <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. In addition, all but the tip portions <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the raised contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are also covered with the metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and intervening third insulation layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to provide a shield against interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The apex array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is configured so that when in abutment with a bond pad on a die, the apexes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be pressured to pierce the hard oxidation layer on the bond pad to engage the underlying conductive metal. The apex array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> configuration further controls the penetration of each apex into the bond pad of a semiconductor device or the metal deformation of the material of the bond pad as well as provides a way to control the amount of force applied to each bond pad and the active surface of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the third insulative layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are shown as overlying the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as the conductive traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and lower portions of the contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> completed interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for testing of a plurality of bare semiconductor dice on a wafer includes a semiconductive substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is configured for multiple electrical connections with the bond pads of multiple semiconductor dice of a wafer. The interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will be positioned to overlie the semiconductor dice having the outlines <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>C as shown. The contact members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are temporarily joined to the respective bond pads on the semiconductor dice by pressure, thereby making electrical contact between the two, and the plurality of individual semiconductor dice may be effectively simultaneously tested. Each contact member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to a bonding site <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is connected to a testing circuit, not shown, by a wire bond, TAB tape, flip chip bumps, or other types of electrical connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also be configured for connection to ball-grid-arrays or other arrays on the bottom side of a semiconductor die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As described in the prior art section of this application, there are other methods for forming raised contact members on substrates for testing semiconductor dice. The method of the invention for forming shields on interconnects includes the application to such devices as well as to the exemplary interconnect described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Use of this interconnect construction results in a testing apparatus which may be configured for simultaneous multi-die testing on a wafer, greatly shortening the test time. KGD testing may be performed at lower cost. Crosstalk and other interference are essentially eliminated or minimized, so the number of dice which may be simultaneously tested is limited only by factors other than electronic interference. Misalignment and the resulting disconnection of contact members in the testing of multiple dice on a wafer are essentially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It is apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made to the interconnect construction and method for forming shielded interconnects and testing apparatuses of the invention as disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
