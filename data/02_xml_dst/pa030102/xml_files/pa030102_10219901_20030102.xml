<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As it is well known, cellular phones present a tremendous advantage in dealing with an emergency situation. For this reason a large percentage of automobiles are now equipped with these phones. However, there are several problems with present cellular phone systems. The primary one is that the owner must pay a monthly charge to maintain the use of a number. A secondary one is that the phones present a theft risk. The third problem is that the usage is so convenient that one can very easily run up large bills. Thus, while people tend to buy a cellular phone for emergency use they will often end up spending a significantly larger amount of money on the monthly charges than have been planned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A number of expensive solutions for emergency cellular phones have been proposed. Grimes (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,479,482 and 5,388,147) and Moore (U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,974) teach a cellular phone connected to a positioning system such as a GPS or Loran. The other art deals with cellular phones that are restricted to calling 911. These include Zicker (U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,388) and Seiderman (U.S. Pat. No. D 5,388,148), although Seiderman also teaches an integrated credit card reader. Other art covers what might be called &ldquo;children&apos;s restricted phones. The patent of Boubelik (U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,570) has a mechanical lock over the keyboard to restrict the use to an emergency call button. The art of Bogusz et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,009) and the SOS Phone (product of SOS wireless communications of 3000 Airway Avenue, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626) restrict the phone to only being able to call two different sites. These two could be, for example, 911 and home (or 911 and a towing company). The patent of Bishop et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,931), assigned to SOS, teaches an emergency phone which requires modifications to the phone company equipment. These modifications would allow the call to bypass the normal cellular call process (col 10 lines 10-13) and to accept specialized numbers including a &ldquo;pseudo area code&rdquo; (col 19, lines 14-19). There is no economy in these inventions. For example, the SOS Phone requires the activation of an access service ($99 per year) and thus the phone saves no money per month. In fact, most cellular companies will give away a full function phone for free if one pays the monthly service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus one would have a more economical and broader function phone by simply signing up for the cheapest monthly service and having the discipline to never use the phone except for an emergency. Unfortunately, few people have that level of discipline or control over third parties that might need the phone. Thus there is a need for an economical and durable disposable emergency cellular phone that can be operated without the need to pay a monthly access fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The most amusing and abusing pretense of a disposable emergency phone is that available from AAA Communications. AAA Communications takes advantage of the altruistic federal requirement that phones with disconnected accounts be able to still dial 911. AAA Communications buys phones with disconnected accounts and resells them for about $200. Their address is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> AAA Communications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 291 Watershed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Noblesville Ind. 46060 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As the cell phone is often used as an emergency communication device it would be useful to combine the cell phone with some sort of personal defense system such as a stun gun that made synergistic use of the battery and antenna of the phone. This has never been done. The patent of Cassarino U.S. Pat. No. 5,988,450 teaches a cell phone and various self-defense packages put together in one box with no synergistic communication. He includes pepper sprays and a taser. This teaches away from the instant invention. Similarly the patent of Julinot U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,192 teaches a pepper spray device disguised to look like a cell phone. This also teaches away from the instant invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts the phone with the antenna collapsed from a side and front view. The basic mechanical components of the phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are the speaker and speaker section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the antenna <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the microphone section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The center section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> carries the batteries and the electronics. It also serves as the base for the &ldquo;911&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to automatically deploy the antenna is shown in the speaker section. In an alternative embodiment, the antenna is slid down into the phone body with a linear spring. When the 911 button is pushed, it releases the antenna, which then slides out the end into a fully extended position when released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the whole phone is made waterproof through the use of waterproof switches, microphone, and speakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the identical components but with the antenna extended. The operation of the spring is such that the antenna is normally fully extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the phone of this embodiment in its weatherproof pouch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This pouch could be made of any water or weatherproof material including vinyl, polycarbonates or other polymers. Along the front end of the pouch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an embedded quick release strip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which has a brightly colored large pull tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. For use of the phone the tab <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is gripped and pulled down the complete length of release line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to open the pouch and access the phone. This then automatically deploys the antenna due to the operation of the integral spring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> On the back of the phone pouch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an attachment means. In the preferred embodiment this is shown as a Velcro&reg; type of mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Alternatively it could be suction cups for glass or adhesives for metal. Further alternatives would include magnets for metal. The Velcro works particularly well for the roof cloth or floor carpeting of many cars. Yet another alternative attachment mechanism would be a combination of Velcro and magnet for universal attachment as shown using the magnets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> embedded in the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pouch is transparent to make the phone contents very obvious in an emergency situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Due to the presence of dedicated integrated circuits the electronic portion of a conventional cellular phone design is doable by anyone skilled in the art of electrical engineering. The circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is meant to be broadly illustrative. The circuitry is not meant to be in great detail as that is no longer necessary with this art. Speaker <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is coupled through capacitors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to audio controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The audio controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives a demodulated audio line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from the RF section chip 66. That RF section chip receives the RF signal from antenna <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Microswitch <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is shown connected to the power supply chip for automatically turning on the phone after the antenna is deployed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Microphone <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is coupled through capacitors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> into the audio controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The audio controller then sends the &ldquo;audio out&rdquo; signal on line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into the RF section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for final transmission out on antenna <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. When the call button <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is depressed the microprocessor microcontroller <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> interprets this and activates the appropriate sequences and the digital controller <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> would then give the appropriate controls to the audio controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Digital controller <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is clocked by a crystal oscillator comprising capacitors <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, crystal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and resistor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. All of the electronic components are powered by battery <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through the power supply chip <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. A representative audio controller is the TCM 8010 of Texas Instruments, P.O. Box 655303, Dallas, Tex. 75265. A representative RF section IC is the TRF 1015 from Texas Instruments. There are numerous manufacturers of microprocessors or microcontrollers. Sample devices are the 8051 or 8032 available from numerous electronic manufacturers. A representative of the digital controller is the TCM 8002 from Texas Instruments. Representative power supply ICs are the TPS9013 or the TPS9104, both of Texas Instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The battery <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a permanently installed primary cell such as an alkaline, lithium, or manganese dioxide cell although many other types could work. The cell must provide high peak currents in transmission but otherwise is not required to have extremely high longevity. By having a permanent primary cell there is an economy over the use of an expensive rechargeable cell and also over the use of a changeable primary cell due to the expense of the battery holders chambers and doors. These battery holders, chambers, and doors for a battery chamber also introduce reliability problems. As an alternative embodiment the battery could be a fixed or removable thermal battery or any practical battery. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The provider (distributor) of the disposable emergency cellular phones will pay a monthly fee for a few phone numbers. Each of these phone numbers (mobile identification number &lsqb;MIN&rsqb;) comes with an electronic serial number (ESN) which will be transmitted with the MIN in order to register to the cellular system. (A conventional cellular phone also transmits its MIN and a unique ESN, which it registers. The ESN is unpublished and is matched with the phone to minimize fraudulent usage.) One feature of this invention is that thousands of the disposable emergency phones could share a small set of MINs and matching ESNs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In operation, the first step is to wait for the 911 button depression <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is to register with a MIN and ESN. Step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is to verify that registration (log on) is established. If it is established then the method proceeds on to step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which is to transmit the 911 number. Then step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> begins a timer. Finally, at step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> the device will disable further transmissions when the timer reaches 60 minutes. In an alternative embodiment, a counter is used to limit the number of 911 calls to a small fixed number, say 5. The total talking time would then be limited only by the battery life and the patience of the 911 operators. If at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> registration was not established then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which is to verify that a carrier signal is present. If no carrier is detected then the method returns to step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to attempt registration again. If the carrier is detected then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and increments to the next MIN (phone number) and ESN (serial number). It then attempts another registration in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The reason for the attempt for different numbers is that it is conceivable that two customers would both be trying to make a 911 call at the exact same time. Were that to occur, the first caller would normally lock out that number nationwide and prevent the second caller from getting through. Thus a disposable cellular phone provider would have a few numbers that a minimal monthly service fee is paid for. The system could try the MINs and ESNs (phone and serial numbers) in a fixed sequence or a random fashion. Alternatively the phone could simply log on with a public phone number and transmit a 311 or 911 call since the FCC requires phone companies to accept 311 and 911 calls regardless of the account status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the physical embodiment of the stun gun in this version of the cell phone. The basic phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a conventional key pad <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and read-out display <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> along with the antenna <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. There is also the on-off button <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> as standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> There is a left side high (mechanical) resistance push button <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to enable the flashlight. Also there is a right side push button <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> to enable the electrical stunning operation when used in conjunction with the switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. When the flashlight is enabled then the battery from the cell phone is connected to high intensity light bulb <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. When both switches <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are enabled simultaneously a high voltage is developed between the pseudo antenna tip <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the tip of the normal antenna <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The angle between the tips <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is very important as it allows the shock to be delivered from the operator&apos;s right hand and angled to attack the arm or hand of an attacker without having to have a full perpendicular contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the synergistic operation of the circuitry. We begin with the battery <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the conventional cell phone circuitry <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, which then drives the conventional antenna <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> for transmission. When switch <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> is depressed then the battery power <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is delivered directly to the light bulb <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to cast an intense beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When both switches <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are depressed then battery current is delivered to oscillator <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Oscillator <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> provides an AC current to transformer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> which develops a high voltage output which is rectified by diode <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and stored in capacitor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In this way a voltage is built up to over 1000 volts on capacitor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. When the voltage exceeds 1000 volts on capacitor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> then the hermetically sealed spark gap <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> will break down and deliver a short intense current through transformer <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. The output of transformer <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> (of about 25,000 to 50,000 volts) will then appear between contacts <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (which is the conventional antenna) and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> which is the shocking probe &ldquo;pseudo antenna.&rdquo; The hermetically sealed spark gap <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> limits that voltage to prevent damage to the circuitry. The Zener diodes <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> serve to protect the cell phone circuitry from the effects of this high voltage and keep the antenna <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> closer to a ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Another key element of this invention is the use of a thermal battery for an emergency phone system. U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,255 teaches the possible use of a thermal battery for a single use external defibrillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The detailed construction of the piles of a thermal battery is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. It begins with a pyrotechnic heat source <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> which is followed by cathode <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> which is followed by an electrolyte <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, followed by anode <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> followed by current collector <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. The electrolyte at normal ambient temperature is a solid, insulating inorganic salt. The electrolyte is rendered molten by the pyrotechnic heat source. The heat melts the electrolyte which causes it to be conductive and deliver electrical power at an extremely high rate. The thermal battery has many attributes making it ideal for an emergency phone system. First, it has no leakage current until it is triggered. Thus it has a shelf life of ten or twenty years. It then delivers current at an extremely high rate for a short period of time on the order of minutes. This is ideal for long range, high power transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Representative materials for the battery anode include lithium, calcium, magnesium, and others. The electrolytes that have been used successfully in these batteries have been lithium chloride and potassium chloride mixtures primarily. Representative cathodes are FeS<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cr<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, WO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CaCrO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>for example. A typical pyrotechnic heat source is iron with KClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the overall construction of a thermal battery. Battery piles <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are shown stacked as discs leaving an open core <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. The electric match <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is placed above that open core. Electric match <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is ignited by current passing through contacts <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Connection <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is used for delivery of current from the battery and the other current delivery connection can be one of the match terminals, either <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, yet a fourth electrode could be used for the battery output current. Insulation material <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is wrapped around the battery to keep it very hot so that it can achieve its high levels of efficiencies. Temperatures on the order of 23&deg; Celsius are not uncommon. Representative insulation that can be used include Mica, silicon-bonded Mica, FiberFrax, Microtherm, Aluminum/Mica combinations, and Min-K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment using an electric match to trigger the thermal battery, a conventional non-thermal small battery such as a lithium battery will deliver current when connected through the electric match circuitry. This will cause the thermal battery to go to its high temperature mode and then deliver current at an extremely high level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Another preferred embodiment for this invention is shown as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> of &ldquo;Thermal Battery Booster System&rdquo; Ser. No. 09/504,500, filed Feb. 15, 2000. In this case the electric match is replaced by a percussion ignitor. This is essentially a primer from a shotgun shell. This has an impact activated explosive. A spring loaded percussion ignition system comprising a firing pin and spring (or other mechanical activation means). Then the firing pin will contact the percussion ignitor to begin the thermal battery ignition process. This will then allow the thermal battery to begin delivering extremely high currents without the need for an electric match and small triggering battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the method of operating the thermal battery emergency phone. We begin at step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which is to activate the phone. At step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> the base station carrier is attempted to be detected. If the base station carrier is detected then we go to step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> which is to proceed as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to register. If the base station carrier is not detected in step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> then we go to step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and the system asks if the number 911 was dialed. If it was not then we go to step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> which warns that only 911 calls can get through with the high-power operation at this point and returns to step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. If 911 was, in fact, dialed then the system permits the move to step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> which is to go to unrestricted mode in which case it will scan all carriers and frequencies. Thus if the subscriber&apos;s main provider was the local System A which is unavailable it could also allow System B as well as other frequencies. At step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> the system looks for a base station carrier to be detected. If it is, then it would proceed as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> before. If it is not then the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> at which point the thermal battery is activated and the system goes to a maximum power transmit level of 20 watts. This is important as a thermal battery is able to provide at least 20 watts of output power, or even up to 50 watts but only for a short period of time. Thus the output power is merely limited by the output stage transistors and a significant increase in range would be obtained. The conventional cell phones are limited to three-watt power and thus, for this emergency operation, an output of 12 watts gives an increase of four times which would give a doubling of the range by the square power law. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The invention of using multiple MINs and ESNs for a generic number phone system has many uses beyond the emergency cellular voice phone. Some of these embodiments are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The set of MINs and ESNs for a given set of phones would be stored in the memory of each of the phones. The provider can download additional numbers to generic phone number customers if it is found that they are experiencing excessive waits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows the operation of the generic number phone for sending and receiving local data. The subscriber unit could be a laptop computer, a palmtop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular phone with a sufficient display to read Email, or other means of entering or displaying digital messages. It could be a car computer with a digital display terminal. The exact hardware system is quite flexible. The operation begins in step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> where the operator activates the mobile data phone. At step <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> the selection is made to send or receive data. If the decision is made to send data then the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> and asks if the data is ready for transmission. If it is then the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> which it would also go to if it was ready to receive data. If at step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> the system is not ready to transmit data then it goes to step <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> where it opens an email screen for the operator. At this point the operator must at step <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> prepare the email message. When this is ready then everything goes to step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> where the system will attempt a registration with a randomly chosen mobile identification number MIN<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>and an electronic serial number ESN<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. These numbers are not capriciously chosen but are rather from the list of approved numbers for this service. At step <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, if the system finds the registration was unsuccessful due to the fact that someone else was using that mobile identification number and that serial number, then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. At that point j is increased by 1 and the system goes back to step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to attempt registration with the next MIN<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>and ESN<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. When registration is finally successful then the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> where it will send and receive data. After the data is sent or received the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> which is to hang up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the on/off times that are available when an operator types a four digit number. In this case the operator has typed in a PIN or a subscriber&apos;s line number of 5678. This operation generates eight distinct times beginning with the &ldquo;space&rdquo; time T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is the time from the prompt or previous number to the pushing of the &ldquo;5&rdquo; key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Then there is the &ldquo;key-down&rdquo; time T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is the amount of time the &ldquo;5&rdquo; key is held down, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> This set of times provides a distinct signature of the operator due to the fact that everyone has different typing habits. This is the subject of co-pending application Ser. No. 08/942,820, &ldquo;ATM signature security system&rdquo; filed Oct. 2, 1997. The operation of this security system is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and also later on in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> as one application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> we begin with step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> which measures space times and key down times during entry of a phone or PIN. Step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the system transmits the vector of times <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to the base station which selects the stored signature acceptance criteria based on the type of phone being used. In step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> the transmitted vector is compared to the existing signature range. In step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> the comparison results are acted on. If the transmitted vector of times is found to be within limits then the call or transaction is approved at step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Then at step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> the vector is used to update the stored signature slightly to account for aging or changing of patterns of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the vector was out of limits then the customer is asked to reenter the number at step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. The vector is then compared to the stored signature at step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and if it is then found within limits then the operation proceeds to step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. If the vector is found to be outside of limits for the second time then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to initiate the emergency procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An important alternative embodiment to the system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> involves comparing the signature internally at the phone at step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> rather than at the base station. This would allow the phone to be modified and not require modification of base stations. The disadvantage is that one could perhaps fraudulently modify phones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the application of this generic number cellular telephone to monitor people. This could be a criminal in house arrest or a child. The step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is to attach a phone to monitor a person with a tamperproof means. Step <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is pseudo random number generator, which generates random call times. This is to prevent a sophisticated criminal from having a scanner, or other sense of detection of a cellular phone transmission, detecting when the cell phone is making a transmission and assuming that he or she is free to move about in between. The pseudo random number generator would randomly generate call times between one minute and several hours of each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> the location of the call is recorded at a monitoring base station as the call comes in. This location could be generated by modern cellular location systems from &ldquo;enhanced 911&rdquo; service or could use even the simpler version, which simply gives the cellular antenna involved. The more sophisticated but expensive system would involve the use of GPS receiver including the monitor. This has a disadvantage of being unable to report when someone is indoors so the GPS system would have to store the most recent good GPS data. To prevent the fraud of having the criminal cover the GPS antenna to allow movement the system would have the backup of noting the base cellular antenna to demonstrate significant movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Finally at step <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> authorities are alerted if the monitored person is in an inappropriate location. This is done by the base station making appropriate calls that could also be done automatically from the attached cellular phone on the monitored person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Similarly, this invention will be very useful for the monitoring of stolen cars. When circuitry in the car detects that the car is being moved by unauthorized people, then the generic phone number cellular phone will begin transmitting this fact along with location information. Also, by differentiating the position information, the system can calculate the direction of heading and forward all of this to the authorities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows the method of this invention for medical monitoring. It begins at step <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> recording diagnostic information. This could be from an implantable device or an external monitor or a nerve stimulator, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> It then moves to step <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and asks if the information suggests an emergency. If it suggests an emergency then it proceeds to step <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> to call 911 as done in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The system then, at step <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, generates a recorded (actually synthesized) voice giving the nature and location of the emergency and then goes to step <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> to hang up. If the information does not suggest an emergency then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> where it registers under the generic mobile identification number and electronic serial number also shown earlier in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> the system will then ask if the registration was successful. If it is then it goes to step <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> to do a burst transmission of the data to the appropriate number and then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> to hang up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the registration was unsuccessful in step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and generates a random (or pseudo-random) number delay from 1 to 59 seconds and then goes back to step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to attempt registration. This is due to the fact that another similar system or the same service may be attempting to transmit the medical information at the exact same second. Note that this system does not require a batch of MINs. This exact embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> allows just the mere waiting for an open &ldquo;slot&rdquo;. Of course this can also be combined with the searching for further phone numbers as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> This approach can also be used for industrial emergency monitoring. The term is here used to refer to many (often unwitnessed) emergencies such as oil and water spills or factory or forest fires. Before this invention, one would have had to pay for a cellular phone account for each monitoring site. With the instant invention, an enormous number of monitoring sites can use the same generic number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the method of using the instant invention to allow the cell phone to act as a car or house key. The system begins at step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> where the operator is prompted to enter a PIN into the key pad. At step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> the systems asks if the PIN matches the base station database. If it does not, then at step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> we prompt for reentry and go back to step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. If the PIN matches then the system goes on to <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> to transmit a pseudo random binary number (PRBN) to unlock the car. As an alternative to a PIN the system will prompt as many people as there are PINs to enter their home phone number in step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> the system does a keystroke dynamics to verify the identity as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. Once the identity is verified then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> to transmit the PRBN to unlock the car or house. If the identity is not verified then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> to prompt for reentry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is shown the embodiment of the invention for modification to allow police and emergency vehicles to get the attention of the operator. There is a major problem with people talking on their cellular phones and not hearing emergency vehicles behind them. The system proceeds as follows. At step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> the system asks if 10 seconds has elapsed. This is because the system will at every 10 seconds check the emergency vehicle warning transmission. If 10 seconds has not elapsed then the system at step <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> continues with normal phone procedures. If it is time for a 10 second check then the systems proceeds to step <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> where it checks for the emergency transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If an emergency warning transmission is detected in step <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> where it asks if the operator phone is connected to 911. This is very important as criminal usage to spoof a police transmission could be used to shut off a citizen&apos;s cell phone and thus prevent them from making an emergency call. It is important that a 911 call be able to bypass the shut off. If the operator is connected to 911 then the system proceeds to step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> where the warning is given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> If in fact the user is not connected to 911 then the system goes to step <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> and warns by the synthesized voice of an emergency vehicle and disconnects the existing call so that the user/driver can focus on driving out of the way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> depicts the fax scanning version of the invention. Here charge coupled device (CCD) scanning array <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is embedded in linear lens <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight>. The scanned data is observed in either the &ldquo;fisheye&rdquo; lens <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> or in the normal operating screen <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>. With this scanner the phone can either directly send a fax or, with optical character recognition circuitry, send actual text based on the scanned image. </paragraph>
