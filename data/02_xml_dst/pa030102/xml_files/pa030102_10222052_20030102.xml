<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a pump for bicycles and, more particularly, to a pump for pumping at two pressures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Cycling is a popular activity for exercising. Many people ride mountain bikes equipped with pneumatic cushions. A great proportion of such riders carry pumps on their mountain bikes for pumping tires and pneumatic pumps. A pneumatic cushion however requires less air at a higher pressure than a tire does. A nozzle designed for engagement with an inlet of a tire often fails engagement with an inlet of a pneumatic cushion for being unable to sustain such a high pressure during pumping of the pneumatic cushion. To avoid this problem, a pump may be equipped with an ordinary nozzle for engagement with an inlet of a tire and a high-pressure nozzle for engagement with an inlet of a pneumatic cushion. However, such a high-pressure nozzle is often forgotten or lost, thus rendering it impossible to pump such a pneumatic cushion. Besides, it is always troublesome to replace an ordinary nozzle with a high-pressure nozzle and vice versa. Moreover, engagement of an ordinary or high-pressure nozzle with a flexible pipe leading from such a pump becomes slack after replacement takes place for some times. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is installed in the reduced portion of the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for closing and opening the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> consists of a stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a shutter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a seal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> defines a central aperture and includes an external edge received in an annular groove defined in a wall of the reduced portion of the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is received in the reduced portion of the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to contact the annular stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The shutter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes a first side and a second side from which a rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends. A seal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the form of a ring is mounted on the rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The shutter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is received in the reduced portion of the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that its first side contacts the spring <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and that the rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends through the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and that the seal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can contact the partition <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in order to seal the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the controller/nozzle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a nozzle <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extending from the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An axial channel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> extends through the entire controller/nozzle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A radial channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends in the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so as to be communicated with the axial channel <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes an external face that includes an ordinary portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of an ordinary radius and a reduced portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of a reduced radius. The radial channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends through the reduced portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, two annular grooves <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are defined in the external face of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The reduced portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is located between the annular grooves <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a free end of a reduced diameter and a thread <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> formed on an internal face at the free end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An annular seal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is received in each of the grooves <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. An annular seal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is mounted on the free end of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, together with the annular seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, is inserted in the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is divided into a first portion through which the first channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is communicated with the channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a second portion through which the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is communicated with the channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> defined between the wall of the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the external face of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and between the annular seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A bolt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes a thread <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> formed thereon for engagement with the thread <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a head <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for retaining the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be rotated in the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between a first position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> in order to pump at a first pressure and a second position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> in order to pump at a second pressure higher than the first pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> To pump at the first pressure, the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is located in the first position where the reduced portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in contact with or at a very limited distance from the rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Thus, the seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is allowed to contact the partition <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in order to seal the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Air can only be transmitted from the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the first channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the channel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the first channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the first portion of the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The enlarged end of the piston <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is positioned against the enlarged end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Due to this position of the piston <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> relative to the piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and due to the check valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, air cannot be driven into the chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be reciprocated in the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to drive air out of the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the first pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To pump at the second pressure, the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is located in the second position where the ordinary portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> pushes the rod <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so as to disengage the seal <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from the partition <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, thus opening the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Air can be driven from the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the channels <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the controller/nozzle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the second channel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second portion of the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In addition, the enlarged end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved to an end of its stroke in the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to seal the first channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the cylinder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is reciprocated in the chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the piston/cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to drive air out of the nozzle <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the second pressure. </paragraph>
