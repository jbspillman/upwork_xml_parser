<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An LOC die assembly includes a die dielectrically adhered to the underside of a lead frame. The active surface of the die underlying the attached lead frame is coated with a polymeric material such as polyimide. The underside of the lead frame overlying the die is coated with a layer of soft material, such as silver, which has a lower hardness than the coating on the active surface for absorbing point stresses. Penetration of stacked filler particles into the soft material reduces point stresses on the active die surface and disadhesion stresses on the lead frame components. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the fabrication of semiconductor devices such as a &ldquo;leads over chip&rdquo; (LOC) die assembly. More specifically, the invention pertains to a method and apparatus for reducing the stress resulting from the lodging of filler particles present in plastic encapsulants between the undersides of the lead frame leads and the active surface of the die, an integrated circuit semiconductor device, in a die assembly encapsulated in plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of LOC semiconductor die assemblies has become relatively common in the industry. This style or configuration of semiconductor device replaces a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; lead frame with a central, integral support (commonly called a die-attach tab, paddle or island) to which the back surface of a semiconductor die is secured, with a lead frame arrangement wherein the dedicated die-attach support is eliminated and at least some of the leads extend over the active surface of the die. The die is then adhered to the lead extensions with an adhesive dielectric layer of some sort disposed between the undersides of the lead extensions and the die. Early examples of LOC assemblies are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,862,245 to Pashby et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,059 to Kubota et al. More recent examples of the implementation of LOC technology are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,068,712; 5,184,208; 5,233,220; 5,252,853; 5,277,661; 5,286,679; 5,304,842; 5,418,189; 5,461,255; 5,466,888; 5,545,921; and 5,576,246. In instances known to the inventors, LOC assemblies employ large quantities or horizontal cross-sectional areas of adhesive to enhance physical support of the die for handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Traditional lead frame die assemblies using a die-attach tab place the inner ends of the lead frame leads in close lateral proximity to the periphery of the active die surface where the bond pads are located, wire bonds then being formed between the lead ends and the bond pads. LOC die assemblies, by their extension of inner lead ends over the die, permit physical support of the die from the leads themselves as well as more diverse (including centralized) placement of the bond pads on the active surface, as well as the use of the leads for heat transfer from the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, use of LOC die assemblies in combination with plastic packaging of the LOC die assembly, as known in the art, has demonstrated some shortcomings of LOC technology as presently practiced in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By far the most common manner of forming a plastic package about a die assembly is molding, and specifically transfer molding. In this process (and with specific reference to LOC die assemblies), a semiconductor die is suspended by its active surface from the underside of inner lead extensions of a lead frame (typically Cu or Alloy 42) by a tape, screen print or spin-on dielectric adhesive layer. The bond pads of the die and the inner lead ends of the frame are then electrically connected by wire bonds (typically Au, although Al and other metal alloy wires have also been employed) by means known in the art. The resulting LOC die assembly, which may comprise the framework of a dual-in-line package (DIP), zig-zag in-line package (ZIP), small outline j-lead package (SOJ), quad flat pack (QFP), plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC), surface mount device (SMD) or other plastic package configuration known in the art, is placed in a mold cavity and encapsulated in a thermosetting polymer which, when heated, reacts irreversibly to form a highly cross-linked matrix no longer capable of being remelted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The thermosetting polymer generally is comprised of three major components: an epoxy resin, a hardener including (accelerators), and a filler material. Other additives such as flame retardants, mold release agents and colorants are also employed in relatively small amounts. While many variations of the three major components are known in the art, the focus of the present invention resides in the filler materials employed in the thermosetting polymer and their effects on the active die surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Filler materials are usually a form of fused silica, although other materials such as calcium carbonates, calcium silicates, talc, mica and clays have been employed for less rigorous applications. Powdered fused quartz is currently the primary filler used in encapsulants. Each of the above filler materials is a relatively hard material, particularly when compared to the die surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Fillers provide a number of advantages in comparison to unfilled encapsulants. For example, fillers reinforce the polymer and thus provide additional package strength, enhance thermal conductivity of the package, provide enhanced resistance to thermal shock, and greatly reduce the cost of the encapsulating material in comparison to unfilled polymer. Fillers also beneficially reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composite material by about fifty percent in comparison to the unfilled polymer, resulting in a CTE much closer to that of the silicon or gallium arsenide die. Filler materials, however, also present some recognized disadvantages, including increasing the stiffness of the plastic package and the moisture permeability of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One previously unrecognized disadvantage discovered by the inventors herein is damage to the active die surface resulting from encapsulant filler particles becoming lodged or wedged between the underside of the lead extensions and the active die surface during transfer molding of the plastic package about the die and the inner lead ends of the LOC die assembly. The filler particles, which may literally be jammed in position due to deleterious polymer flow patterns and flow imbalances in the mold cavity during encapsulation, place the active die surface under residual stress at the points of contact of the particles. The hard particles may then damage the die surface or conductive elements thereon or immediately thereunder when the package is further stressed (mechanically, thermally, electrically) during post-encapsulation handling and testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> While it is possible to employ a lower volume of filler in the encapsulating polymer to reduce potential for filler particle lodging or wedging, a drastic reduction in filler volume raises costs of the polymer to unacceptable levels. Currently available filler technology also imposes certain limitations as to practical beneficial reductions in particle size (currently in the 75 to 125 micron range, with the larger end of the range being easier to achieve with consistency) and in the shape of the filler particles. While it is desirable that particles be of generally spherical shape, it has thus far proven impossible to eliminate non-spherical flakes or chips which, in the wrong orientation, maximize stress on the die surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Ongoing advances in design and manufacturing technology provide increasingly thinner conductive, semiconductive and dielectric layers in state-of-the-art dice, and the width and pitch of conductors serving various purposes on the active surface of the die are likewise being continually reduced. The resulting die structures, while robust and reliable for their intended uses, nonetheless become more stress-susceptible due to the minimal strength provided by the minute widths, depths and spacings of their constituent elements. The integrity of active surface die coats such as silicon dioxide, doped silicon dioxides such as phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) or borophosphorous silicate glass (BPSG), or silicon nitride, may thus be compromised by point stresses applied by filler particles, the result being unanticipated shortening of device life if not immediate, detectable damage or alteration of performance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,059 to Kubota et al. does incidentally disclose several exemplary LOC arrangements which appear to greatly space the leads over the chip or which do not appear to provide significant areas for filler particle lodging. However, such structures may create fabrication and lead spacing and positioning difficulties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,410 to Jain et al. discloses methods for suppressing stress-induced defects in semiconductor leads. The specific problems addressed by Jain et al. do not include damage to the die by filler material particles, and their solution to lead damage is to provide a stress-reducing layer over the leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To the inventor&apos;s knowledge, those of ordinary skill in the art have failed to recognize the particular stress phenomenon attendant to transfer molding and the use of filled encapsulants, nor has the current state of the art provided an LOC structure which beneficially accommodates this phenomenon. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a lead-supported die assembly for an LOC arrangement that substantially reduces the stress that may otherwise potentially form between the leads and the active die surface due to the presence of filler particles of the polymer encapsulant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A layer of relatively soft material, i.e. less hard than the die active surface or its covering, is adhered to the underside of the leads overlying peripheral portions of the die. Filler particles in the encapsulant which may become stacked between portions of the die and the overlying lead portions preferentially penetrate the soft layer on the lead portions, thus protecting the die surface from damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The soft material may be a soft metal such as essentially pure silver or other relatively inert metal, or an alloy thereof. The soft material must be inert to avoid detrimental chemical reactions with other chemical species after encapsulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the soft material may be a polymer designed to have a low hardness, at least during the encapsulation process. The polymeric material hardness prior to encapsulation is less than about one-half the hardness of the die or any coating thereon. The polymer may subsequently harden, but has served its purpose in absorbing forces exerted by filler particles during encapsulation. The preferential penetration of filler particles into the soft material layer protects the die surface from damage.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> So that the reader may more fully understand the present invention in the context of the prior art, its seems appropriate to provide a brief description of a transfer apparatus and method for forming a plastic package about a leads-over-chip (LOC) die assembly. The term &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; molding is descriptive of this process as the molding compound (encapsulant), once melted, is transferred under pressure to a plurality of remotely-located mold cavities containing die assemblies to be encapsulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts the typical process sequence for plastic package molding. It should be noted that the solder dip/plate operation has been shown as one step for brevity; normally coating would occur prior to the &ldquo;trim and form&rdquo; step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show pre-molding and post-molding positions of encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during a transfer molding operation using a typical mold apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprising upper and lower mold halves <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each mold half including a platen <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with its associated chase <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Heating elements <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are employed in the platens <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to maintain an elevated and relatively uniform temperature in the runners <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and mold cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> during the molding operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a top view showing one side of the transfer mold apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. A die assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is placed in each mold cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for encapsulation. In the transfer mold apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown, the encapsulant (resin mold compound) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> flows into each mold cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through the short end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operation of encapsulation is as follows. A heated pellet of resin mold compound or encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed beneath ram or plunger <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in pot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is forced downwardly, melting the pellet and forcing the melted encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> down through sprue <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and into primary runner <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The melted encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then travels to transversely-oriented secondary runners <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and across gates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into and through the mold cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, flowing across the die assemblies <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each die assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is within a mold cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and comprises a die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with an attached lead frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The die assemblies <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are typically disposed in strips so that a strip of e.g. six lead frames <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>) may be cut and placed in and across the six cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Air in the primary runners <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, secondary runners <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and mold cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is vented to the atmosphere through vents <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. At the end of the molding operation, the encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;packed&rdquo; by application of a higher pressure to eliminate voids and reduce non-uniformities of the encapsulant in the mold cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. After molding, the encapsulated die assemblies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are ejected from the cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by ejector pins <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, after which they are post-cured at an elevated temperature to complete cross-linking of the encapsulating thermoset resin, followed by other operations as known in the art and set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that other transfer molding apparatus configurations, as well as variations in details of the described method are known in the art. However, the instant invention is applicable irrespective of the particular details of the transfer molding operation, and such alternate encapsulating procedures will be discussed herein only to the extent that they may affect the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The flow of encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the mold cavities <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is demonstrably non-uniform. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the presence of the die assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprising a die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with lead frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> disposed across the mid-section of a cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> splits the viscous encapsulant flow front <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into upper <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and lower <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> components. Further, the presence of the (relatively) large die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with its relatively lower temperature in the middle of a cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> permits the flow front <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on each side of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to advance ahead of the front which passes over and under the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show two mold cavity encapsulant flow scenarios where, respectively, the lower flow front <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the upper flow front <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> lead the overall encapsulant flow front <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the cavity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> containing the die assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> depicts the advance of a typical flow front <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from above, before and after a die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is encountered, the flow being depicted as time-separated instantaneous flow fronts <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> depict a packaged LOC assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed by transfer molding, wherein hard filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> incorporated in the encapsulant become lodged between lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the underlying die surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The non-uniform flow characteristics of the viscous encapsulant <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as described above, may cause (in addition to other phenomena such as wire sweep, which this invention does not address) particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to be more forcefully driven into the spaces <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> between the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and wedged or jammed in place in low-clearance areas. As the encapsulant flow front <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> advances (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) and the mold operation is completed by packing the cavities or spaces <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, pressure in substantially all portions of the cavities reaches hydrostatic. With prior art lead and adhesive LOC arrangements, the relative inflexibility of the tightly-constrained (adhered) lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> maintains the point stresses of the particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> trapped under the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. These residual stresses are carried forward in the fabrication process to post-cure and beyond. When mechanical, thermal, or electrical stresses attendant to post-encapsulation processing are added to the residual point stresses associated with the lodged filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, cracking or perforation of the die coat <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may occur, with the adverse effects previously noted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It has been observed that filler particle-induced damage to a die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> occurs more frequently in close proximity to the dielectric adhesive <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, where lead flexure potential is at its minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> To graphically illustrate the above description of particle lodging, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> depicts a prior art packaged LOC assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> wherein a single lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends over a die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with a segment of dielectric adhesive <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, in this instance a piece of polyimide tape, adhered to both the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the active surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the die. As better illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, filler particle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which is part of the packaging material <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, is lodged between lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. It is clear that the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is tightly constrained from movement by the inflexibility of the attachment of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by adhesive <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the relative closeness of the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the active surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the inability of the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to flex or relax to reduce stress occasioned by the presence of the filler particle <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may continue even after the encapsulant has reached hydrostatic balance such that the filler particle may become tightly lodged and wedged between the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the active surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present invention described below provides relief from the particle caused stresses in the die, as well as in the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, a packaged LOC semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the invention comprises at least one lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the lead end extending over, and spaced from die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. For the sake of simplicity, a single bond wire <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> between a bond site <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on a lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a bond pad <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the active surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown. More typically, each of a plurality of lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is conductively attached to a bond pad <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by an e.g. thin gold bond wire <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the conductive connections between the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be by tape automated bonding (TAB), whereby the lead ends are bonded directly to bond pads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each of the lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is shown attached to the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by an intervening layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of dielectric adhesive, which may be e.g. a polyimide film or adhesive tape such as KAPTON&trade; tape, a trademark of DuPont. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is relatively hard when compared to the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which is typically a glass. During encapsulation of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of filler material in the encapsulant are forced by the flow front of encapsulant into the initial space or recess <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> between the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> along the outer edge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Pressure of the hard particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> against the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> occasionally leads to damage of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In accordance with this invention, such damage to the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is eliminated or greatly reduced by a displaceable stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (also called a displaceable layer herein) which is attached to the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). While the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> need only extend from the outer edge <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the dielectric adhesive <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the outer edge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it may extend further inward to the inner ends <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and be an intervening layer between the lead undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of dielectric adhesive. As will be described below, an advantage of such extension is that when the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is formed of elemental silver or similar metal/alloy, the bond between the lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the dielectric adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is believed to be significantly enhanced, thus avoiding debonding which occasionally occurs in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may also extend outwardly away from the outer edge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to ensure full coverage over the space or recess <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. However, such extension is preferably only a short distance, particularly when the layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comprises a costly metal. Thus, at one extreme, the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may cover the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> adjacent the space or recess <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> only. At the other extreme, the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may cover the entire undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the particular application and the composition of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a preferred embodiment typically includes a soft material layer covering the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> adjacent both space or recess <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the dielectric adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comprises soft material on the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> absorbs the energy of impinging filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Thus, a particle or particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> forcibly entering the space <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> between the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> will preferentially penetrate the soft material layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The soft material of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has preferentially less than about {fraction (1/2)} the hardness value of the opposing surface, e.g. die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, contacted by the hard filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. However, the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> must have a hardness value sufficient to prevent sloughing off of soft material therefrom. Typically, a hardness of about 0.05 to about 0.5 times that of the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is preferred. Expressed in another form, the Brinell hardness of the compression layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> will be less than about 40-50 but at least about 5-10 Brinnel units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the particular desired property of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is, in actuality, the ease with which it may be penetrated by a hard object. Hardness, as measured by the Brinell or other scale, is a convenient and fairly accurate measure of this property, but other properties which reflect penetrability may be alternatively specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The material of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be a soft metal such as essentially pure silver or other relatively inert metal, or an alloy thereof with a generally low hardness, including pure metals such as palladium and platinum and their alloys. The soft material must be generally inert under manufacturing, encapsulating and post-encapsulation conditions to avoid detrimental chemical reactions with other chemical species during and following encapsulation. Because of this restriction, together with cost considerations, the number of possible metals which may find practical use as a stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is limited. However, silver has been found to be an excellent material for the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in terms of hardness (about 25-35 Brinell units), chemical resistance, and cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, silver plating is typically used as an external protective layer over the e.g. aluminum lead frame following its manufacture and prior to bonding it to the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Ordinarily, most or all of the silver is removed by e.g. etching prior to die-to-lead frame bonding to enhance bonding and/or for silver recovery. Although silver may be left on the wire bond sites to enhance electrical connection, a silver oxide layer may form on the silver, resulting in wire bonds of lower strength. Thus, in general practice, all of the silver coating may be removed prior to die-to-lead frame bonding. The very thin layer of silver oxide on the silver plate does not significantly increase the hardness value for the purposes of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the instant invention, the preferred method includes removal of all (or nearly all) silver from the lead frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> except that which is to form the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the silver stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is generally about one to five microns, which is sufficient to provide the opportunity for relatively deep penetration by filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Of course, the preferred thickness is the minimum which will provide the desired protection of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The metal stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may also be attached to the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the lead end <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the soft material of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be a polymer designed to have a low hardness, at least during the encapsulation process. Such polymers are known and include epoxies, polyimides, acrylics, and silicones. The polymeric material hardness prior to encapsulation is less than about one-half the hardness of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or the coating thereon. The polymeric stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may subsequently harden further by, e.g., post-encapsulation thermal treatment, but will have served its purpose in absorbing forces exerted by filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> during the encapsulant injection step. The preferential penetration of filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> into the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> protects the die surface from both immediate and subsequent damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of using a stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> formed of a soft polymer is the additional electrical insulation provided thereby. Use of such a stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may make possible a decrease in the required thickness of the adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, e.g. dielectric tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> differs from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> only in that a coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of adhesive dielectric material is applied to non-wirebonding areas of the surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> prior to attachment of the dielectric adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> thereto. While this coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> provides a degree of protection to the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, it has been found that the hard filler particles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> nevertheless may penetrate the coating or high forces transmitted through the coating and damage the die surface. In accordance with this invention, a stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is fixed on the undersurface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and absorbs stresses which are otherwise placed upon and through the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to the die surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a hardness value of less than about {fraction (1/2)} of the hardness value of the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a portion of a LOC semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as described above in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, including die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with bond pads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a lead frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extending over peripheral portions of the die. Conductive wires <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are shown connecting bond pads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with bond sites <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the lead ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The outer edge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the outer edge <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the outer edge <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> overlying the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, and the outer edge <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (on the undersurface of the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) are shown as typically configured. The portion of the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> on the undersurface thereof is shown as hatched, in both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the invention is useful for any device configuration in which at least one lead overlies, faces, and is spaced from the die surface to create a recess therebetween. Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> depicts a different LOC semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in which the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A overlying the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are in the central portion of the die, while leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>B not adhered to the die are connected by wires to peripheral bond pads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B. Typically, leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>A comprise bus bars. The outer edge <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the outer edge <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, the outer edge <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of adhesive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> overlying the coating <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, and the outer edge <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the stress relief layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (on the undersurface of the leads <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) are shown as typically configured for this type of LOC die-to-lead frame attach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a test comparing the penetration and hardness of a polyimide layer and a silver plate sample, a pyramidal indenter was impinged onto the sample at a peak load of 5 grams. The polyimide layer was penetrated to about 0.7 microns and the silver plate sample was penetrated to about 1.1 microns. Calculation of microhardness by the Vickers method indicated that the hardness of the polyimide surface was about 2.5 times that of the silver plate. By way of summary, the advantages of using a stress relief layer of the invention include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> a. a reduction in process steps in manufacturing the leadframe; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> b. a reduction in contamination matter being stripped from the lead frame and being subsequently redeposited during the process of stripping silver from the backsurface of the lead frame; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> c. permits the use of thinner polyimide tape for LOC packages; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> d. permits thinner polyimide coatings; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> e. may result in better adhesion between the compound/compression layer/lead frame interface, enhancing reliability; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> f. may offer improved adhesion between the lead frame and the die attach material. </paragraph>
