<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of therapeutic drug delivery, and in particular to the delivery of therapeutic liquids to the respiratory system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of procedures have been proposed to deliver a drug to a patient. Of particular interest to the present invention are drug delivery procedures where the drug is in liquid form and is delivered to the patient&apos;s lungs. Effective intrapulmonary drug delivery depends on a variety of factors, some of which can be controlled by the clinician or scientist and others that are uncontrollable. Uncontrollable factors include, among others, the airway geometry of the patient&apos;s respiratory tract and lung and other respiratory diseases. Of the controllable factors, two are of particular interest. The first is the droplet size and droplet size distribution. The second is the breathing pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A major factor governing the effectiveness of drug deposition in the lungs is the size of the inspired particles. Depending on the particle size, total deposition in various regions of the lung may vary from 11% to 98%. See Heyder et al., <highlight><italic>Aerosol Sci., </italic></highlight>1986, 17, 811-825, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Therefore, proper selection of particle size provides a way to target liquid droplets to a desired lung region. It is particularly difficult, however, to generate a liquid spray in which all the droplets will have the same size or the same aerodynamic behavior such that drug deposition in the desirable lung region is predictable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A parameter that may be used to define droplet size is the respirable fraction (RF). The respirable fraction (RF) is defined as the fraction of the mass of aerosol droplets falling between a particular size range, usually in the range from about 1 &mgr;m to 6 &mgr;m. See D. C. Cipolla, et al., <highlight><italic>Assessment of Aerosol Delivery Systems for Recombinant Human Deoxyribonuclease, </italic></highlight>S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 4(1) 50-62, 1994, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. As used hereinafter, the term respirable fraction (RF) will include the percentage of droplets having sizes falling in the range of from about 1 &mgr;m to 6 &mgr;m. Another parameter that may be used to evaluate nebulization performance is the efficiency (E). The efficiency (E) of a nebulizer is the amount of liquid which is actually aerosolized and leaves the nebulizer in aerosolized form as compared to the amount of liquid that is initially supplied to the nebulizer. See D. C. Cipolla, et al., <highlight><italic>Assessment of Aerosol Delivery Systems for Recombinant Human Deoxyribonuclease, </italic></highlight>S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 4(1) 50-62, 1994. Still another parameter that may be used to measure the performance of nebulizers is the delivery percentage (D) which is the respirable fraction (RF) multiplied by the efficiency (E). See D. C. Cipolla, et al., <highlight><italic>Assessment of Aerosol Delivery Systems for Recombinant Human Deoxyribonuclease, </italic></highlight>S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 4(1) 50-62, 1994. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A variety of inhalation devices have been proposed including air jet nebulizers, ultrasonic nebulizers, and metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Air jet nebulizers usually utilize a high pressure air compressor and a baffle system that separates the small particles from the spray. Ultrasonic nebulizers generate ultrasonic waves with an oscillating piezoelectric crystal to produce liquid droplets. Another type of ultrasonic nebulizer of interest is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,261,601 and 4,533,082. This nebulizer includes a housing that defines a chamber for holding a quantity of liquid to be dispensed. A perforated membrane is held over the chamber and defines a front wall of the chamber, with the rear surface of the membrane being in constant contact with the reservoir of liquid held in the chamber. The apparatus further includes an ultrasonic vibrator connected to the housing to vibrate the perforated membrane. Typical MDIs usually employ a gas propellant, such as CFC, which carries the therapeutic substance and is sprayed into the mouth of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Most commercially available inhalers produce sprays having a respirable fraction (RF) of 80% or less, with ultrasonic nebulizers usually having a respirable fraction (RF) of less than about 50%, thereby making dosing control difficult and inaccurate. Presently, most commercially available inhalers also have a poor efficiency (E), usually less than about 60%. See D. C. Cipolla, et al., <highlight><italic>Assessment of Aerosol Delivery Systems for Recombinant Human Deoxyribonuclease, </italic></highlight>S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 4(1) 50-62, 1994. Such inefficiency often results from the construction of the nebulizer since a certain amount cannot be nebulized and remains within the device. Since most commercially available nebulizers have both a poor respirable fraction (RF) and a poor efficiency (E), the delivery percentage (D) is also poor. Therefore, such inhalers have generally not been used for delivery of drugs that have potent therapeutic agents such as hormones and peptides or other drugs having a high level of toxicity and which can be expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The second factor influencing droplet deposition is the patient&apos;s breathing pattern. Inhalation flow rate affects the probability of particle impact, while tidal volume and lung volume affect particle residence time in each lung region. Therefore, effective droplet deposition should be adaptable to the inhalation flow rate as well as the patient&apos;s tidal volume and lung volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other important factors often considered when designing an effective therapeutic drug delivery system include both cost and convenience. When nebulizing the medicament, the apparatus involved usually comes in contact with the medicament. Hence, the apparatus will need to be sterilized before reuse, or discarded. However, sterilization may not be convenient for a hand held portable device. Disposal can also be expensive, particularly when the apparatus includes a piezoelectric crystal for nebulizing the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be desirable to provide improved apparatus and methods for the delivery of liquids to the respiratory system. Such apparatus and methods should be capable of producing a spray which may predictably be deposited in selected regions of the lungs. Further, it would be desirable if such a spray were produced from a small volume of liquid. Moreover, it would be desirable if the apparatus and methods provided for a controlled drug delivery rate, preferably being based on the rate of inspiratory air flow generated during inhalation. Finally, it would be desirable if such methods and devices were inexpensive, efficient, and easy to use. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods and apparatus for the delivery of therapeutic liquids to the respiratory system of a patient. In one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus of the present invention is characterized in that it is able to produce a spray having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%. Preferably, the apparatus will eject the liquid at a flow rate of at least about 5 &mgr;l/sec, and preferably more than about 10 &mgr;l/sec. By producing such a spray, the aerodynamic behavior of all the droplets will be substantially the same, thereby enabling the apparatus to be useful in intrapulmonary drug delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The apparatus will preferably include a vibratable non-planar surface or non-planar member with apertures extending therethrough. The non-planar member will preferably comprise a rigid thin shell member having a front surface, a rear surface, and a plurality of apertures extending therebetween. The apertures are tapered so that they narrow from the rear surface to the front surface. A liquid supplier is provided which delivers liquid to the rear surface such that substantially all of the delivered liquid adheres to the thin shell member, and particularly within the large opening of the tapered apertures, by surface tension, i.e. in surface tension contact. A vibrator is further provided which vibrates the thin shell member to eject liquid droplets from the front surface of the thin shell member. Preferably, the apertures will be configured to eject liquid droplets having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%. In another preferable aspect, the apparatus will have an efficiency (E) at or closely approaching 100%, i.e. substantially all liquid supplied to the rear surface will be aerosolized and will be available for inhalation. In this way, the delivery percentage (D) will usually be about the same as the respirable fraction (RF), i.e. greater than about 70%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary aspect, the size of the apertures at the front surface is in the range from about 1 &mgr;m to 6 &mgr;m, with the apertures have a slope at the front surface of about 10&deg; or greater relative to a central axis of the apertures, preferably being in the range from about 10&deg; to 20&deg; relative to the central axis of the apertures, and more preferably being in the range from about 10&deg; to 15&deg; relative to the central axis. Preferably, the thin shell member will have a thickness of about 50 &mgr;m to about 100 &mgr;m, more preferably from about 75 &mgr;m to about 100 &mgr;m which provides the thin shell member with sufficient rigidity to vibrate in unison and provides sufficient aperture volume. In the present invention, ejection of droplets is developed due to the solid/fluid interaction inside the aperture, i.e. the interaction of the liquid against the tapered wall of the aperture. The cross sectional geometry of the aperture is therefore important. For example, if the aperture has a straight cylindrical wall with a slope of 0&deg; relative to the central axis (or a 90&deg; slope relative to the front surface of the thin shell member), ejection will not occur. Instead, the vibratory motion will cause the liquid to break loose from the vibratory surface so that it will not eject through the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For apertures smaller than 6 &mgr;m, the slope near the exit opening of the aperture is particularly important because the discharge coefficient of such an aperture is substantially smaller than for larger apertures. For apertures smaller than 6 &mgr;m, a slight variation in the slope near the small opening of the aperture will make significant influence on ejection of droplets because the tapered shape near the opening increases the surface area that is subjected to solid/fluid interaction near the exit opening. For example, vibration of the thin shell member when the apertures have a slope of 20&deg; (relative to the central axis of the apertures) near the small opening produces 10 times more droplets than when the apertures are at right angles to the front surface. In this manner, a high flow rate can be achieved using a small thin shell member. A small thin shell member is desirable in that it has higher structural rigidity which assists in producing a fine spray as described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary aspect, the thin shell member is hemispherical, parabolic, arc shaped, or curved in geometry, with the large opening of each aperture being located at the concave side, and the small opening of each aperture being located at the convex side. The thin shell member is preferably formed to have a low mass and a very high stiffens which causes the thin shell member to oscillate as a rigid body, i.e. homogeneously. In this way, all the apertures in the thin shell member are subject to the same amplitude so that droplets may be produced with a uniform size and with a desired respiratory fraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, the invention provides an apparatus for nebulizing a liquid having a housing with a proximal end and a distal end. A non-planar member, and preferably a thin shell member, is mounted within the housing, with thin shell member having a plurality of apertures for nebulizing the liquid upon vibration of the thin shell member. A vibrator is provided and is removably attached about the housing which vibrates the thin shell member. Preferably, the thin shell member is mounted within a dynamically isolated portion of the housing. In this manner, the vibration is not transmitted to the housing allowing the vibrator to be dismantled and reinstalled over the housing as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the elements that come in contact with the mouth of the patient or with of the therapeutic liquid are held within the housing. Prior to use, the housing is connected to the vibrator which transmits vibratory motion to the thin shell member inside the housing to produce ejection of droplets which are then entrained in the inspiratory air flow. In this manner, the vibrator will not come into contact with the liquid, thereby allowing the vibrator to be reused with a new and uncontaminated housing. Such a configuration provides an economical nebulizing apparatus since the relatively expensive vibrator may be reused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus is provided which ejects a liquid spray at a rate synchronized with the inspiratory flow created during inhalation so the that ejection rate is proportional to the inspiratory flow rate. The apparatus includes a housing having a distal end and a mouthpiece at a proximal end. A non-planar member, and preferably a thin shell member, is mounted within the housing, with the thin shell member having a plurality of apertures. A vibrator is provided to vibrate the thin shell member and to eject liquid from the apertures. An acoustic chamber is provided within the housing which produces an audible signal during inhalation from the mouthpiece. Further provided is a controller for controlling the rate of thin shell member vibration upon detection of the audible signal. Preferably, the controller includes a microphone which detects the audible signal so that an electrical signal may be sent to the vibrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the patient may simply breath through the mouthpiece (or a nasal adapter) to control the rate of droplet production. The respiratory flow passes through the acoustic chamber which produces the acoustic tone which is proportional to the inspiratory flow rate. Thus, the frequency of the acoustic tone indicates the inspiratory flow rate at any instant of the breathing cycle. Integration of the flow rate with time produces the tidal volume. Both the flow rate and the tidal volume can then be used to determine when the ejector should eject droplets and at what mass flow rate such that maximum deposition of droplets is obtained. Further, the acoustic tone may be recorded to produce a record of the breathing pattern of the patient which may be stored in a microprocessor. This information can be later used to synchronize the ejection of droplets for the same patient. Such information may also be later employed for other diagnostic purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a method for nebulizing a liquid. According to the method, a non-planar member, preferably a thin shell member, having a plurality of tapered apertures extending therethrough is vibrated. The apertures in the thin shell member are configured to produce liquid droplets having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%. In a preferable aspect, liquid is supplied to the thin shell member such that substantially all of the delivered liquid adheres to the thin shell member by surface tension. In this manner, the need for a container or a chamber to hold the liquid against the thin shell member is eliminated. Instead, the liquid is open to the atmosphere and is not subjected to pressurization or reflecting acoustic waves that may be produced within an adjacent chamber. Preferably, liquid will be supplied to the thin shell member by squeezing a liquid reservoir which dispenses a discrete volume of liquid onto the thin shell member. Usually, substantially all liquid delivered to the thin shell member will be transformed into liquid droplets that are available for inhalation, i.e. the efficiency (E) will be at or near 100%. In this way, the delivery percentage (D) will be substantially the same as the respirable fraction (RF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the method provides for producing the liquid droplets at a rate greater than about 5 &mgr;liters per second. In another aspect, the vibrating step further comprises vibrating substantially all of the apertures in the thin shell member in unison. Preferably, the thin shell member will be vibrated at a frequency in the range from about 45 kHz to 200 kHz. In yet another aspect, the thin shell member is held within a housing having a mouthpiece, and the thin shell member is vibrated at a rate corresponding to an inspiratory flow rate through the mouthpiece. In one preferable aspect, the thin shell member is vibrated only during inhalation from the mouthpiece. Control of shell member vibration in this manner may be accomplished by producing an audible signal during inhalation and detecting the produced signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one particular aspect, the vibrating step comprises removably attaching a vibrating source about a housing enclosing the thin shell member and actuating the vibrating source. Optionally, the vibrating source may be removed from the housing and the housing discarded after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a further exemplary method for delivering a liquid to the lungs of a patient. According to the method, a housing is provided having a proximal end and a distal end. Liquid is supplied to an thin shell member disposed within the housing, with the thin shell member having a plurality of tapered apertures extending therethrough. The patient then inhales from the proximal end of the housing at a selected inspiratory flow rate, and the thin shell member is vibrated to eject the liquid at a rate corresponding to the inspiratory flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the method, the inspiratory flow rate is variable. In another aspect, the vibrating step further comprises ejecting the liquid only during inhalation. In still a further aspect, an audible signal is produced during inhalation and the produced signal is detected to control the rate of vibration of the thin shell member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The thin shell member will preferably be vibrated to produce liquid droplets having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%. In another preferable aspect, liquid will be supplied to the thin shell member such that substantially all of the delivered liquid adheres to the thin shell member by surface tension. Preferably, substantially all of the apertures in the thin shell member will be vibrated in unison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides an exemplary apparatus for nebulizing a liquid. The apparatus is particularly useful in accurately dispensing discrete quantities of a liquid, such as a single unit dosage of a liquid medicament. The apparatus comprises a thin shell member comprising a front surface, a rear surface, and a plurality of apertures extending therebetween. The apertures are tapered to narrow from the rear surface to the front surface. A liquid supplier is provided to deliver a predetermined unit volume of liquid to the rear surface. A vibrator vibrates the thin shell member to eject liquid droplets from the front surface of the thin shell member. Hence, by delivering only a unit volume of liquid to the rear surface and ejecting the entire unit volume, an apparatus for precisely nebulizing a known unit volume of liquid is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary aspect, the liquid supplier comprises a canister which holds the liquid under pressure. Usually, the canister will comprise a storage reservoir and a valve which allows the predetermined unit volume of liquid to be delivered from the canister when the valve is in an open position. In a preferable aspect, the valve comprises a chamber having a piston therein and a stem having a proximal end and a distal end. The stem includes an elongate groove at the distal end which places the storage reservoir and the chamber in fluid communication when the valve is in a closed position so that the chamber may be filled with liquid from the storage reservoir. The stem further includes a lumen at the proximal end which is placed in fluid communication with the chamber when the valve is in the open position such that a unit volume of the liquid within the chamber is forced out of the lumen and onto the rear surface of the thin shell member upon translation of the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another particular aspect, a spring is included adjacent the piston so that the piston may be automatically translated to force the unit volume of liquid from the chamber when the valve is in the open position. The pressure within the storage reservoir then compresses the spring to allow the chamber to be refilled with liquid from the storage reservoir when the valve is in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect, an acoustical sensor is provided which detects when the unit volume of liquid has been ejected from the thin shell member. Preferably, the acoustical sensor comprises a piezoelectric element. In this manner, a user may be informed as to whether all of the liquid supplied to the thin shell member has been nebulized. In yet another aspect, the apparatus includes a mouthpiece and a means for actuating the vibrator when a patient begins to inhale from the mouthpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides an exemplary method for nebulizing a single unit volume of liquid, such as a unit dosage of a liquid medicament. According to the method, a thin shell member is provided which comprises a front surface, a rear surface, and a plurality of apertures extending therebetween. The apertures are tapered to narrow from the rear surface to the front surface. A valve is then opened to deliver a unit volume of the liquid from a container and to the rear surface of the thin shell member. The thin shell member is vibrated until substantially all of the unit volume of the liquid on the rear surface is ejected from the front surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one particular aspect, a piston is translated within the container sufficient to expel the unit volume of the liquid from the container and onto the rear surface when the valve is opened. Preferably, the valve is spring biased so that the piston will automatically translate upon opening of the valve. In another aspect, the container holds the liquid under pressure so that the piston will be translated in an opposite direction by force of the liquid to compress the spring when the valve is closed. In this way, the container will be refilled when the valve is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the container comprises a canister which holds the liquid in a pressurized storage reservoir. The valve comprises a chamber having a spring loaded piston therein and a stem having a proximal end and a distal end and an elongate groove at the distal end which places the storage reservoir and the chamber in fluid communication when the valve is in a closed position. In this manner, opening of the valve is accomplished by depressing the valve stem to place a lumen at the proximal end of the stem in fluid communication with the chamber so that a unit volume of the liquid within the chamber will be forced out the lumen upon translation of the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another particular aspect, a step is provided for sensing when the unit volume of liquid has been ejected from the thin shell member. Preferably, such sensing is accomplished by detecting a change of an acoustical signal generated by the vibrating thin shell member to indicate when the unit volume has been ejected. Preferably, the acoustical signal is sensed with a piezoelectric element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, a mouthpiece is provided which is spaced-apart from the thin shell member. With such a configuration, a step is provided for sensing when a patient inhales from the mouthpiece and vibrating the thin shell member only during inhalation. In still another aspect, the unit volume of liquid that is nebulized is in the range from about 20 &mgr;l to about 100 &mgr;l. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The invention still further provides another exemplary apparatus for nebulizing a liquid. The apparatus comprises a thin shell member comprising a front surface, a rear surface, and a plurality of apertures extending therebetween, with apertures being tapered to narrow from the rear surface to the front surface. A liquid reservoir is provided, and a capillary system is in fluid communication with the liquid reservoir. The capillary system is disposed to draw liquid from the reservoir by capillary action for delivery to the rear surface of the thin shell member. A vibrator is also provided and vibrates the thin shell member to eject liquid droplets from the front surface of the thin shell member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In one preferable aspect, the capillary system comprises a wicking member having a bottom end within the liquid reservoir and a delivery end near the rear surface of the thin shell member. An outer member is spaced-apart from the wicking member by a capillary gap so that liquid from the reservoir may be drawn through the capillary gap and toward the delivery end by capillary action. Preferably, the wicking member further includes at least one capillary channel at the delivery end so that liquid delivered from the capillary gap may continue its travel to the rear surface of the thin shell member through the capillary channel. In another preferable aspect, a bottom portion of the wicking member is cylindrical in geometry, and the outer member includes an annular body which surrounds the wicking member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary aspect, the apparatus further includes a housing having a chamber and a mouthpiece, with the outer member being attached to the housing. The wicking member is attached to the liquid reservoir which in turn is detachably secured to the housing so that the liquid reservoir may be separated from the housing. In another aspect, the wicking member includes a flexible portion so that it may axially flex upon contact with the vibrating member. In this way, contact of the wicking member will not interfere with the performance of the vibratable member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In still yet another aspect, the liquid reservoir has a concave shape and includes capillary channels which move the liquid toward the capillary gap between the outer member and the wicking member. A power supply is further provided which supplies power to the vibrator. The power supply may comprise a battery, a rechargeable battery, an AC or a DC power source, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The invention still further provides an exemplary method for nebulizing a liquid by providing a thin shell member comprising a front surface, a rear surface, and a plurality of apertures extending therebetween. The apertures are tapered to narrow from the rear surface to the front surface. Liquid is drawn from a liquid reservoir by capillary action to place the liquid in contact with the rear surface of the thin shell member. The thin shell member is vibrated to eject the liquid on the rear surface from the front surface, with liquid being continuously supplied from the liquid reservoir to the rear surface as the thin shell member is vibrated. In this manner, substantially all of the liquid within the reservoir may be nebulized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary aspect, the capillary action is provided by a capillary gap between a wicking member and an outer member, with the wicking member having a bottom end within the liquid reservoir and a delivery end near the rear surface of the thin shell member. The capillary action may optionally be augmented by providing at least one capillary channel at the delivery end of the wicking member so that liquid from the capillary gap may continue its travel to the thin shell member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the method, a housing is provided having a chamber, a mouthpiece, the outer member, and the vibratable member. In this manner, the reservoir may be attached to the housing prior to vibrating the vibratable member. After nebulizing the liquid, the housing may be detached from the reservoir so that the housing and reservoir may be washed. In another exemplary aspect, the housing may be titled while nebulizing the liquid, thereby allowing a patient to inhale from the mouthpiece while lying down. In still another aspect, at least some of the liquid is transferred from the liquid reservoir and to the capillary gap by capillary action.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The invention provides methods and apparatus for producing a very fine spray useful in pulmonary drug delivery procedures. The invention provides for producing a spray having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%. The efficiency (E) of the nebulization apparatus will usually be at or near 100%, leading to a delivery percentage (D) which is substantially the same as the respirable fraction (RF). Such a spray will preferably be produced at a flow rate of at least about 5 &mgr;l per second, and more preferably at least about 10 &mgr;l per second. In this manner, a spray of a selected size is produced where the aerodynamic behavior of all the droplets is substantially the same, thereby enabling the spray to be predictably deposited in selected regions of the lungs during intrapulmonary drug delivery procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The invention may be employed to deliver a wide variety of drugs to the respiratory system, and will preferably be used to deliver drugs having potent therapeutic agents, such as hormones, peptides, and other drugs requiring precise dosing. Liquid drugs which may be nebulized using the present invention include drugs in solution form (e.g., in aqueous solution, ethanol solution, aqueous/ethanol mixture solution, and the like), in colloidal suspension form, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The invention will preferably be configured to supply the spray upon demand, i.e., the spray will be produced and delivered only upon inhalation by the patient. Further, such a spray will preferably be produced and delivered at a rate corresponding to the inhalation or inspiratory flow rate produced by the patient when inhaling the spray. In this manner, the spray will be produced only when the patient is inhaling, and will preferably be produced at a rate corresponding to the inhalation rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The invention will provide such a spray by providing the liquid to a vibratable non-planar member, which is preferably a thin shell member having a plurality of apertures. Liquid is preferably supplied to the thin shell member such that substantially all of the delivered liquid will adhere to the thin shell member by surface tension. Upon vibration of the thin shell member, the adhering liquid will be ejected through the apertures to form the fine spray. In this manner, a precise and controlled amount of liquid drug can be supplied to the thin shell member for nebulization, thereby eliminating the need for a fluid reservoir to be placed against the thin shell member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Apertures in the thin shell member of the invention will preferably be tapered in geometry, with the smaller end of the aperture being located at a front surface of the thin shell member and the larger opening of the aperture being at the rear surface of the thin shell member. The size of the apertures at the front surface will preferably be in the range from about 1 &mgr;m to 6 &mgr;m, with the slope of the apertures at the front surface being in the range from about 10&deg; or greater relative to a central axis extending through the apertures, preferably from about 10&deg; to 20&deg; relative to the central axis extending through the apertures, and more preferably being in the range from about 10&deg; to 15&deg; relative to the central axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures, an exemplary embodiment of a nebulizing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the nebulizing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a disposable mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a removable oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, construction of the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be described. The mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes an elongate tubular housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a proximal end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At the distal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a mouthpiece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, while a liquid supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is at the proximal end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As will be described in grater detail. hereinafter, a carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends from the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is provided to hold a thin shell member within the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An elastomeric O-ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is placed adjacent the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is positioned against a vibrating beam as described in greater detail hereinafter. To dynamically isolate the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of an elastomeric material, preferably having a modulus of elasticity of about 100 psi to 150 psi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the interior of the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be described. The tubular housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forms a central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Annularly extending into the central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In turn, the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached about a thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having a front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Extending between the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are a plurality of tapered apertures (not shown) having the smaller opening at the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the larger opening at the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Upon vibration of the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, is vibrated so that liquid may be ejected through the apertures and from the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> An amount of liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is supplied to the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the liquid supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The liquid cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a divider <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that separates the liquid supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into an air volume <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. To dispense liquid from the liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the liquid supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is squeezed to force liquid in the liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a nozzle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> where it comes into contact with the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> becomes permanently deformed when squeezed so that the liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> delivered to the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will not be withdrawn back into the liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The size of the air volume <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will be configured such that all of the liquid within the liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will be transferred from the liquid volume <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> when the cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is squeezed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> delivered from the supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will usually be held to the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> solely by surface tension forces. In this way, the liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may remain in contact with the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> until ejected and without the need for a separate chamber to hold the liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> against the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. To eject the liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is vibrated to in turn vibrate the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The liquid <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> adhering to the rear surface then passes through the apertures and from the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,740 and copending application Ser. No. 08/163,850 filed Dec. 7, 1993 and 08/417,311, filed Apr. 5, 1995, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a thin, rigid material having a hemispherical geometry. Alternatively, the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be parabolic, arc shaped, or curved in geometry. The thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will have a very high bending stiffness which will allow it to follow the vibratory motion of the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as a rigid body. In this way, the entire thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will vibrate in unison so that all apertures are subject to the same amplitude of vibration. Such vibration will assist in ejecting uniformly sized droplets (i.e. having a respirable fraction (RF) of greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90%) simultaneously from most or all of the apertures. The spray produced by the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is dispensed into the central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the direction of the opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this manner, as the patient inhales from the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the spray within the central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be drawn into the patient&apos;s lungs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> To control the time and/or rate at which the spray is produced, the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further includes an acoustic chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Upon inhalation, air within the central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes through the holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to produce an acoustic tone. This tone may be detected as described in greater detail hereinafter and used to determine both when the patient is inhaling and the patient&apos;s inspiratory flow rate. Such a signal may then be used to actuate the oscillating assembly which vibrates the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Such a signal may be employed to control the time at which the shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is vibrated, e.g., such as only during inhalation. Alternatively, such a signal may also be employed to vibrate the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at a frequency corresponding to the inspiratory flow rate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates one example of acoustical frequencies that may be produced for various inspiratory flow rates. For instance, an inspiratory flow rate of about 20 liters per second will generate an acoustical frequency of about 15 kHz. In turn, the detected frequency may be employed to drive the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, operation of the combined mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be described. The mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will preferably be constructed so that it may be removably attached to the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be discarded after use, while the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which will not come into contact with the liquid may be reused. One particular advantage of such a configuration is that the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be constructed relatively inexpensively by not including an internal oscillator. Since the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be reused, costs to the patient are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by sliding the proximal end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through an opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) in a cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> until the o-ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> engages and is secured against the cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as indicated by the arrows. A latching mechanism (not shown) may optionally be provided to removably latch the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with a free end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a fixed end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The fixed end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is attached to an electronic circuit board <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by a pair of screws <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, thus limiting the ability of the fixed end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to vibrate. On the other hand, the free end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is attached to the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is free to vibrate. A piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is bonded to the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and transmits vibratory motion to the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be varied depending on the frequency of vibration. In one particular embodiment which is usually vibrated at 45 kHz to 200 kHz, the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a length of about 30 mm to 80 mm, preferably at about 40 mm, a width of about 8 mm to 15 mm, preferably at about 12 mm, and a thickness of about 0.5 mm to 1 mm, preferably at about 0.7 mm. Such a beam will preferably be oscillated at a frequency of about 45 kHz which corresponds to the natural frequency of the beam. When vibrated, the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will have an oscillation mode shape <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as illustrated in phantom line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Upon vibration of the cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the elastomeric material of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> prevents transfer of vibratory energy through the tubular housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this manner, only the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the adjacent portion of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are vibrated so that only minimal energy is needed to sufficiently vibrate the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The cantilever beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably be vibrated to produce an oscillation amplitude of about 0.001 mm at the free end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Such vibration is transferred to the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via the carrier plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to produce a fine spray particles having a desired respirable fraction (RF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In one experiment, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> was vibrated at a frequency of 45 kHz, and the particle size and distribution was measured by a particle sizer commercially available from Malvern Instruments Inc. (Southburrow, Mass.). The results indicated that about 94.99% of the particles were in the range from 1 to 6 micron with a flow rate of about 10 cubic &mgr;l per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> To operate the nebulizing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the patient first attaches the mouthpiece assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the oscillating assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as previously described. The liquid supply cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then squeezed to transfer the liquid to the rear surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The patient then places his mouth over the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and begins to inhale. As air is drawn through the central chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an acoustic tone is produced by the acoustic chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the acoustic tone may be detected by a microphone <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on the circuit board <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The detected acoustic signal is then processed by the circuit board <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is used to drive the piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> at a frequency proportional to the acoustical frequency. In this manner, spray begins to eject from the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> upon inhalation, and at a rate that is proportional to the inspiratory flow rate. After the patient has fully inhaled, the acoustic signal ceases, thereby ceasing vibration of the piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. If all of the liquid has not been dispensed, the patient may again inhale as previously described until all of the liquid has been delivered to the patient&apos;s lungs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an exemplary embodiment of an aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that may be included in the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will be described. The aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a conical shape, with a large opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> being at the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a small opening <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> being at the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. At the small opening <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> will have a slope, &thgr;, measured relative to a central axis extending through the aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The slope &thgr; at the small opening <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> will preferably be in the range from about 10&deg; to 20&deg;, more preferably in the range from about 10&deg; to 15&deg; and most preferably at about 15&deg;. As the aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> approaches the large opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the slope may increase as illustrated. Preferably, the slope of the aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> at the large opening <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will be about 45&deg; relative to the central axis, although the angle is not as critical as near the small opening. The slope of the aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> near the small opening <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is particularly important since ejection from the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will occur at the front surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> where the small opening <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is located. The slope, &thgr;, should usually be at least about 10&deg; with respect to the axis of the aperture to insure optimal ejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an alternative aperture <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for the thin shell member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will be described. The aperture <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is conical and has a large opening <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the rear surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a small opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> at the front surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. When viewed in cross-section, the aperture <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is formed of portions of two circles, with each circle having the same radius. The circles are positioned so that the slope &thgr; at the small opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will be in the range from about 10&deg; to 20&deg; relative to the central axis, more preferably from about 10&deg; to 15&deg;, and most preferably at about 12&deg;. When the small opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is sized at about 3 microns and has a taper of about 12&deg;, the ejection rate from the small opening <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is approximately 100 times greater than a quadrant-edge aperture having a 0&deg; slope at the small opening as described in Jorissen, A. L., <highlight><italic>Discharged Measurement at Low Reynolds Number, </italic></highlight>ASME, February 1956, pp. 365-368, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, an exemplary system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for delivering a predetermined unit volume of liquid to a vibratable member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will be described. Vibratable member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> vibrates a thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> similar to the other thin shell members described herein so that liquid placed in surface tension with the rear side of the thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will be ejected from a front side. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided so that only a predetermined unit volume of liquid will be supplied to the thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In this way, when vibratable member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is vibrated, the unit volume of liquid will be nebulized. Such a system is therefore advantageous in applications where a known volume of liquid is to be nebulized, such as when producing an aerosolized dosage of a medicament. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with a source of liquid <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which is preferably held under pressure. Liquid from source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> passes through a line <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, through a valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (shown in an open configuration), through a line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and into a metering chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Metering chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a spring biased piston <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which is moved against a stop <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> when chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is filled with the liquid. When piston <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is against stop <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, metering chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> contains a unit volume so that when piston <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is fully translated as shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a unit volume of liquid will be expelled into a line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Connected to line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which is in a closed configuration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this way, the liquid within metering chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will be prevented from leaving until valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When metering chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is full, valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is closed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Then, when a unit volume of liquid is ready to be supplied to thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is opened. When valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is opened, piston <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> translates by force of a spring <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to force a unit volume of liquid out of metering chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In turn, a unit volume of liquid is delivered to thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through a line <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The system lines will preferably be small enough so that minimal liquid will remain in the lines after being expelled from chamber <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing substantially all of the unit volume to de delivered to thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This unit volume is in the range from about 30 &mgr;l to about 70 &mgr;l, and more usually about 50 &mgr;l in volume and adheres to thin shell member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by surface tension. As vibratable member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is vibrated, the unit volume of liquid delivered to thin shell member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will be nebulized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for nebulizing a unit volume of liquid will be described. Apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a removable top end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and a mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. When top end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is depressed, a unit volume of a liquid is made available for nebulization as described in greater detail hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> (which is a rear view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may optionally include a pair of flip blades <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which may be inserted into an AC adapter or outlet to recharge batteries <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) which supply power to apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. After recharging, flip blades <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> may be rotated and placed within slots <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for convenient storage. Although shown with rechargeable batteries, apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may have power supplied by any of a variety of power sources including DC power supplies, AC power supplies, batteries, including rechargeable batteries, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, construction of apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail. Apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> includes a container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> having a top end <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and bottom end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. When within housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, top end <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is positioned against batteries <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that a gap <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is provided between top end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as shown. Bottom end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> includes a valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> having a stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> with a proximal end <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Distal end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> rests on a shelf <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> so that when top end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is depressed, the gap <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> between top end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is closed. In turn, stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is translated further into container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to deliver a unit volume of liquid into a passage <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> where it will be delivered to a rear surface of a thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of a vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be constructed similar to other embodiments described herein so that when vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is vibrated, liquid on the rear surface of thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> will be dispensed from the front surface. Thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A, a</cross-reference> side view of thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is shown with a plurality of tapered apertures <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> from which the liquid is ejected as previously described with other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is caused to vibrate by a piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> in turn is electrically connected to a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> by wires (not shown), with the circuit board <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> having the electronics necessary to vibrate piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> may be constructed similar to and vibrated at frequencies similar to those previously described herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,740 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 08/163,850, filed Dec. 7, 1993 and 08/417,311, filed Apr. 5, 1995, previously incorporated by reference. Power is supplied to circuit board <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> from batteries <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which may optionally be rechargeable as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by a pair of mounting screws <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is bent so that thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> will be positioned to eject liquid into mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As a patient draws upon mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, air is drawn into housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through a plurality of air inlets <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. In this manner, outside air sweeps through an acoustic chamber <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> so that the patient may inhale nebulized liquid produced from the thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Acoustic chamber <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is used in combination with a microphone <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> on circuit board <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to control actuation of piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Such an operation is similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> as previously described. Hence, when a patient inhales from mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, air drawn through acoustic chamber <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> will produce an acoustic sound, preferably outside the audible range, which is detected by microphone <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. In turn, circuit board <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> sends a signal to actuate piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> to vibrate vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In this way, liquid is nebulized when the patient begins to inhale. When inhalation is stopped, microphone <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> will detect a stoppage of the acoustical signal so that vibration of vibratable member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> will be stopped. The patient may continue to inhale from mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> until the entire unit volume of liquid at the rear surface of thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is dispensed. In this way, it may be assured that only a unit volume of liquid will be delivered to the patient (and on demand) since only a unit volume of liquid will be delivered to thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Further, little or no liquid will be wasted since the volume of liquid at the rear surface of thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> will be nebulized only during inhalation from mouthpiece <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> further includes an acoustical sensor <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> to detect when the unit volume of liquid has been ejected from thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a piezoelectric element which vibrates from an acoustical signal generated when liquid adheres to the rear surface of thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. When all of the liquid is ejected, sensor <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> will cease to vibrate indicating that all of the liquid has been nebulized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, construction of container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> will be described. Container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is constructed of a rigid material, such as aluminum, so that container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may hold a volume of liquid under pressure. Exemplary gases for holding liquid within container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> under pressure include Nitrogen, air, or any inert gases, and the like. It will be understood that while the liquid within container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is held under pressure, container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> will not include a propellant solution or an aerosol generating chemical as is typically used with conventional aerosol devices, such as MDI&apos;s. As such, container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> will be positioned such that top end <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is positioned vertically above bottom end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) so that the liquid will be in contact with valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As previously described, valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which is secured to container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> by an insert <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and a cap <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Positioned over stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical seal <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, an O-ring seal <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, a piston <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, a metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, and a washer <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. Stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> further includes an elongate groove <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> at proximal end <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. A lumen <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> extends through stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> at distal end <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and terminates in a side port <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is shown in a closed configuration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In the closed configuration, a first spring <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> biases a lip <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> of valve stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> against washer <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, thereby placing the interior of container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in fluid communication with the interior of metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> via groove <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. When in the closed configuration, the fluid within container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> fills metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and overflows into the space between insert <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> via holes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The pressurized liquid in turn translates piston <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and compresses a second spring <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is normally in the closed configuration so that as long as fluid remains within container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, liquid will compress second spring <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to fill valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Dispensing of a unit volume amount of liquid from valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, valve <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is translated into container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> until elongate groove <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> no longer provides a fluid path from container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> into metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. At the same time, lumen <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is placed in fluid communication with the interior of metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> via side port <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. At this point, second spring <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> expands (since the pressure in container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> will not be available to keep it compressed) to axially translate both piston <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and O-ring <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> within the space between insert <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and metering chamber member <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. This in turn forces a unit volume of liquid from valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> where it will flow through lumen <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. After leaving lumen <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, the unit volume of liquid will flow to thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> via passage <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as previously described in connection in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> After the unit volume of liquid has been dispensed from valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, first spring <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will again translate stem <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> against washer <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> so that valve <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may refill as previously described. In this manner, each time stem <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is translated into container <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, a unit volume of liquid will be dispensed. Moreover, since substantially all of the liquid delivered to the thin shell member <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> will be nebulized, apparatus <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be employed to-precisely deliver a unit dosage of a medicament to a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, another exemplary embodiment of an apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for nebulizing a liquid for prolonged treatments will be described. Apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which defines a chamber <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A mouthpiece <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is attached to housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> via a tube <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further comprises a base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> which defines a liquid reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> includes a pin <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which is placed within an L-shaped slot <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> on housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this manner, base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be removably attached to housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> by inserting pin <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> into slot <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and rotating base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> clockwise relative to housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> further includes a cylindrical opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> into which a wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is received. As described in greater detail hereinafter, wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> draws fluid by capillary action from liquid reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and to a thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of a vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. To assist in drawing liquid at any orientation from liquid reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, liquid reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may optionally include a plurality of capillary channels <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Liquid reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is provided with a generally concave geometry so that liquid held therein will tend to flow toward cylindrical opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> even when base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is significantly tilted. Capillary channels <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> further assist in drawing any liquid to cylindrical opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> by capillary action. In this manner, reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is designed so that substantially all of the liquid placed therein will be distributed to cylindrical opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> where it may be drawn by wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> up to thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. In this way, no significant amount of liquid will remain within reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, but will substantially all be nebulized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is connected to housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> via an adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, which also functions as a connector for an external power supply. A mounting plate <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is placed between adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> may be constructed essentially identical to embodiments previously described herein and will operate in a similar manner. A lid <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) is provided to enclose chamber <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, construction of wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail. Wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> having a cylindrical base portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. Base portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> may optionally include a capillary channel <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> to assist in drawing the liquid up the base portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. Additional capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> are included in body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and extend up to tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> to assist in drawing up liquid to tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. Tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, further includes a concave well <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> which holds liquid drawn through capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> so that the liquid may be nebulized by the thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Although the size of capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> may vary depending upon the type of liquid to be nebulized, capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> will preferably have a gap in the range from about 50 &mgr;m to about 250 &mgr;m, and more preferably from about 100 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Preferably, tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> will be in contact with thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> during vibration to ensure that liquid at tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> will be delivered to thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. To ensure that wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> will not interfere with the vibration of thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of cutouts <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> which provide body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with axial flexibility. The cutouts <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> therefore allow for manufacturing tolerances to be eased when constructing the wicking member. Body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will preferably be constructed of an ABS plastic (which has good wetting capabilities) so that, with the assistance of cutouts <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will axially flex as thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is vibrated. Wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may optionally be spring-loaded to prevent vibrational interference with vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, operation of apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will be described. Initially, reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is filled with an amount of liquid, such as a unit dosage of a liquid medicament. To assist in filling reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be separated from housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. When filled, liquid within reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will tend to settle (or be drawn into) opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, cylindrical opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> will be slightly spaced apart from cylindrical base portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to provide an annular capillary gap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> therebetween. Gap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> will preferably be in the range from about 50 &mgr;m to about 250 &mgr;m, and more preferably from about 100 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m. In this manner, liquid within opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> will be drawn vertically up wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> through capillary gap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> further includes a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> which surrounds body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as shown. Cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> provides an annular gap <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> which is similar in size to capillary gap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. In this manner, liquid rising through capillary gap <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> will continue its travel up elongate body <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> via capillary cap <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. As the rising liquid reaches capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, the liquid continues its travel toward tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> through capillary channels <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Vibratable member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes a piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> which vibrates thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> as previously described to eject liquid into chamber <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Hence, by employing wicking member <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, substantially all of the liquid supplied to reservoir <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will be drawn to tip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> where it may be nebulized by thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. In this manner, it can be assured that all the liquid will be nebulized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, as thin shell member <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> nebulizes the liquid, a patient may inhale from mouthpiece <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to drawn the nebulized liquid from chamber <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Chamber <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes at least one air hole <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> so that air may be drawn through the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> during patient inhalation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, upon completion of nebulization, base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be removed from housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In this manner, apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may easily be cleaned. For example, once base <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has been separated from housing <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, both pieces may be placed in a conventional dishwasher for cleaning and sterilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the manner of supplying power to apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will be described. Adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is configured to receive a connector <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of a DC adapter system <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. Adapter system <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> includes a male plug <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> which may by inserted into, for example, a twelve volt DC power source of an automobile. A switch <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is provided to regulate delivery of power to apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> further includes a printed circuit board (not shown) which is similar to that board of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and which drives piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a variety of other power sources may be employed to operate apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> conventional AC plug <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be provided to supply alternating current to apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The alternating current will preferably be converted to DC power in order to drive piezoelectric element <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, internal batteries may be supplied to operate apparatus <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing invention has been described in detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be appreciated that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
