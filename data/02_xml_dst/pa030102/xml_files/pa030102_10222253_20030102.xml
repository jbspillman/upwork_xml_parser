<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A notebook computer has a keyboard including a deflectable base plate on the top side of which a series of parallel rows of depressible key structures are operatively mounted. The base plate is structurally reinforced, without increasing the overall height of the keyboard, using elongated stiffening ribs disposed within the interior of the keyboard. The ribs longitudinally extend parallel to the key rows, are anchored beam-like to the top side of the base plate, and are interdigitated with the key rows. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to keyboard apparatus and, in a preferred embodiment thereof, more particularly relates to a notebook computer keyboard having a deflectable base plate reinforced with stiffening ribs secured thereto and interdigitated with rows of keys mounted thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As computer keyboards, particularly notebook computer keyboards, become thinner and thinner the keyboard stiffness (i.e., resistance to downward deflection while being typed on) is correspondingly being reduced. If the keyboard lacks stiffness and the system does not provide sufficient support to the keyboard, the keyboard can feel &ldquo;spongy&rdquo; while the customer types on it. This keyboard deflection can be undesirably equated by the user to poor quality construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As typically constructed, notebook computer keyboards include a deflectable metal base plate on the top side of which the depressible key portions of the keyboard are mounted. Conventional methods for increasing the stiffness of keyboards of this type include (1) increasing the thickness of the keyboard base plate, (2) changing to a stiffer base plate material (for example, from aluminum to cold rolled steel), and (3) attaching stiffener plates to the bottom side of the base plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Each of these three conventional approaches to stiffening the deflectable base plate portion of a notebook computer keyboard carries with it at least one disadvantage. For example, there is typically a weight penalty when the keyboard base plate material is changed to a stiffer material. If the keyboard base plate thickness is increased, or stiffener plates are secured to the bottom side of the base plate, there are thickness and/or weight penalties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it can readily be seen that a need exists for improved structure for providing a keyboard of the type generally described above with increased stiffness. It is to this need that the present invention is directed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In carrying out principles of the present invention, in accordance with a preferred embodiment thereof, an electronic device, representatively a portable notebook computer, is provided with a specially designed structurally reinforced keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The keyboard, in a preferred embodiment thereof, includes a deflectable base member having a top side, a parallel plurality of laterally spaced rows of depressible key structures supported on the top side of the base member, and a plurality of elongated stiffening ribs longitudinally extending parallel to the key rows, anchored to the top side of the base member, and interdigitated with the key rows. Because of the unique placement of the stiffening ribs on the top side of the base member, coupled with the interdigitation of the ribs with the key rows, the ribs substantially stiffen the base plate, and thus the entire keyboard, from the inside of the keyboard. In this manner a desirable enhancement of the overall rigidity of the keyboard is achieved without undesirably increasing its overall height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the deflectable base member has a generally plate-shaped configuration, and the stiffening ribs have generally plate-shaped main body portions anchored in a beam-like orientation on the top side of the base member. In a preferred configuration thereof, each stiffening rib has a lower side edge from which an elongated securement tab portion laterally projects transversely to the main body portion of the stiffening rib, and the securement tab portion of each stiffening rib is anchored to the top side of the deflectable base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, each of the key structures includes a key member having a bottom side and being movable toward and away from the top side of the base member between downwardly depressed and upwardly extended positions, respectively, and the bottom sides of the key members have notches formed therein and positioned to receive portions of the securement tabs when the key members are moved to their downwardly depressed positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the main body portions of the stiffening ribs have top side edges, each of the key members has an upper side, and the top side edges of the stiffening rib main body portions are positioned so as to be located generally level with the upper side of each key member when the key member is mooed to its downwardly depressed position. In this manner, the stiffening ribs do not interfere with the depression of the key members or undesirably come into contact with the keyboard user&apos;s fingers as the key members are depressed during typing on the keyboard. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Perspectively illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an electronic device, representatively a portable notebook computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which incorporates therein a specially designed keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention. The computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown resting atop a suitable horizontal support surface, such as a desktop <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and includes a rectangular base housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having top and bottom sides <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, front and rear sides <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and left and right ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is complementarily received in an elongated rectangular opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed in the top base housing side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and having opposite left and right ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a series of manually depressible key members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generally arranged in various laterally spaced parallel rows R that longitudinally extend in a left-to-right direction relative to the base housing top side opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition to its base housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a somewhat thinner rectangular lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is hinge-secured, as at <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, to a rear top side portion of the base housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative thereto (as indicated by the double-ended arrow <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) between a generally upright open use orientation (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in which the lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> exposes the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a downwardly tilted closed storage and transport orientation in which the lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extends across and parallel to the top base housing side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and covers the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A suitable latch structure (not shown) is provided for releasably locking the lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this closed storage and transport orientation. Lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a rectangular display screen <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mounted on the front or inner side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> thereof, the display screen <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> facing forwardly and being exposed to user view, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the lid housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is in its open use orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a bottom side portion of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is defined by a deflectable base plate member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is representatively formed from a relatively thin sheet of a suitable light weight metal material such as aluminum. Base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has an elongated rectangular configuration, and has opposite left and right ends <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which, with the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operatively installed in the computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are respectively adjacent the left and right ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the base housing top side opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The parallel rows R of key members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are mounted on the top side of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by suitable support means, such as the conventional scissor linkages <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> schematically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Underlying the key members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are resilient return spring members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which are operatively positioned atop a multi-layer signal pad structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> secured to the top side of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The spring members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the signal pad <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are of conventional construction, with the spring members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> representatively being elastomeric key return dome members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Each of the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is upwardly biased by its underlying return spring member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to an upwardly extended ready-to-use orientation, and is manually movable to a downwardly depressed position (as in the case of the key <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) against the resilient resistance of its return spring member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. When a particular key <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is so depressed, it downwardly deforms its associated return spring member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and, in a conventional manner, causes the deformed return spring member to forcibly close a switch (not shown) embedded in the signal pad <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, causes circuitry extending through the pad structure <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to generate an appropriate key output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to a primary aspect of the present invention, the deflectable base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is structurally reinforced in a unique manner substantially stiffening the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> without increasing the height of the keyboard. This is achieved by placing elongated stiffening rib members <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a unique orientation within the interior of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Still referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, each stiffening rib <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is representatively formed from a strip of relatively stiff material (such as steel) and has an elongated, generally plate-shaped main body portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with an upper edge <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Extending outwardly from the lower edge of the main body portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a transverse securement tab portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> longitudinally extend parallel to the left-to-right length of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a laterally spaced relationship, with the stiffening rib securement tab portions <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> being suitably anchored to the top side of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This, in turn, anchors the stiffening rib body portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in a beam-like manner transversely to the top side of the deflectable base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are positioned on the top side of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a manner such that their upwardly projecting main body portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are received in the spaces S between adjacent pairs of key rows R (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) when the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are installed on the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The vertical heights of the stiffening rib main body portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are sized in a manner such that when any one of the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is depressed (see, e.g., the key <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), its top side is generally level with the top side edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> immediately to the front and rear of the key. This prevents the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from interfering with the user&apos;s fingers or the depression of the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, clearance notches <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are formed in lower rear corner portions of the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to receive portions of the stiffening rib securement tabs <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> when the keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are depressed to allow full downward travel of the keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> By interdigitating the upwardly projecting stiffening rib body portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the rows R of keys <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within the interior of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the deflectable base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and thus the entire keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is structurally reinforced without the necessity of increasing the height of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally, since such rib body portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are oriented in a beam-like manner on the top side of the base plate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, they may be relatively thin so that the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> do not substantially increase the overall weight of the keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the cross-section of the stiffening ribs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> along their lengths has a generally L-shaped configuration (which makes the ribs particularly easy to shape), it will be readily appreciated by those of skill in this particular art that the stiffening ribs could be formed in a variety of alternate cross-sectional configurations if desired. Additionally, while the structurally reinforced keyboard <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been representatively incorporated in a notebook computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it will be readily appreciated that it could be alternatively incorporated in or utilized in conjunction with a variety of other electronic devices as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as being given by way of illustration and example only, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited solely by the appended claims.</paragraph>
