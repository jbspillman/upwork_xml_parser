<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an electronics package design and more particularly to a case design for devices such as batteries and capacitors that require separation of electric polarity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In typical electronics packaging such as a capacitor or the battery case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, separation of polarity is achieved by using a sealed feedthrough <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that includes a feedthrough pin <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, feedthrough insulator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and feedthrough body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The feedthrough body is one polarity and is insulated from the feedthrough pin, which is of opposite polarity. The feedthrough acts to carry the charge from the internal components of the battery to outside the battery. Feedthrough technology is well known, and feedthroughs can be designed in a variety of dimensions and materials. One of the design criteria for the typical feedthrough is that its length must be sufficient to form a hermetic seal within itself and to the battery case lid <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is hermetically sealed to the battery case body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This length takes up precious space in the internal volume of the sealed package or adds to the external geometry of the case. In either instance, volume is sacrificed for nonactive components of the package. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The package of the present invention minimizes this ineffective volume by incorporating the function of the feedthrough into a tubular case wall. The case is constructed by interposing an insulative partition between two conductive portions of the tubular case wall to electrically separate the two conductive portions, allowing each portion to have a different polarity. This allows the positive polarity components of the battery to be electrically connected to one portion of the tubular case wall and the negative polarity components to be connected to a separate portion of the tubular case wall, carrying the charge to the outside of the battery through the tubular case wall, thus eliminating the need for a separate feedthrough. By this invention, a single sealed chamber is created with a minimum of wasted space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Battery assembly is simplified with this invention. First, the electrodes along with the separator are wound around a mandrel to form a &ldquo;jellyroll&rdquo;. The electrodes have tabs extending from them that will be later attached to the case. The tabs from the positive electrode extend in opposite direction of the tabs from the negative electrode. The jellyroll is then inserted into the bipolar case with the tabs extending outside of the case. One end cap is then fit into place, sandwiching the tabs in the interface between the case and the end cap. The end cap is then laser welded to the case, simultaneously connecting the tabs to one end of the case. The battery is then filled with electrolyte from the open end of the case. After filling, the other end cap is positioned and hermetically sealed with the sandwiched tabs in the end cap&mdash;tubular case wall interface. The battery is then sent to undergo formation cycling. For the battery of the present invention, to be considered hermetic, the seals must have a leak rate of less than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>atm-cc/sec He. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a variation of the invention, the insulative partition forms substantially the entire tubular case wall, with end caps carrying the charge. The tabs are sandwiched between the end caps and metal rings, which are hermetically sealed to the insulative partition.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The following text describes the preferred mode presently contemplated for carrying out the invention and is not intended to describe all possible modifications and variations consistent with the spirit and purpose of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed by interposing an insulative partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> between two conductive case portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the tubular case wall to electrically separate them, allowing them to have two different polarities. This allows the positive polarity components of the battery to be electrically connected to one portion of the tubular case wall and the negative polarity components to be connected to a separate portion of the tubular case wall. The charge is carried to the outside of the battery through the tubular case wall, thus eliminating the need for a separate feedthrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The insulative partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> preferably is ceramic such as glass, aluminum oxide, or zirconium oxide but may alternatively comprise a polymer, and preferably has the same inside and outside diameters of the conductive case portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. However, it may be desirable for strength to provide a slightly thicker insulative partition than the conductive case portion; to maximize the internal volume, it is preferred that the insulative partition not extend into the internal volume more than 100% of the conductive case portion wall thickness beyond the conductive case portion. The conductive case portion preferably has a thickness of 0.3 to 0.8 mm, and preferably about 0.5 mm, and the insulative partition preferably has a wall thickness of about 0.3 to 1 mm. The insulative partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be mechanically attached to the separate conductive case portions by brazing, welding, or other mechanical attachment method, preferably forming a hermetic seal. The insulative partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> preferably has a width of at least 1 mm to ensure that conductive case portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are electrically separated and not shorted during manufacturing such as by forming a bridge with brazing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A variety of materials can be chosen for the case; however, the materials&apos; coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), dimensions, and assembly methods must be considered in combination and chosen to prevent cracking. The chemistry of the electrolyte and active electrode materials is also important when choosing case materials. The electrolyte may be liquid, such as a lithium salt dissolved in a mixture of a nonaqueous liquid solvent, or may be gel or solid polymer. For lithium-ion batteries, Ti-6-4, other Ti alloys, Al, Al alloys, and 300 series stainless steels are especially suitable for the positive conductive case portions and end caps, and CP Ti, Ti alloys, Cu, Al, Al alloys, Ni, Pb, and stainless steels are especially suitable for the negative conductive case portions and end caps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The insulative material is preferably a ceramic, and most preferably zirconium oxide, to provide strength. Alternatively, the insulative material may comprise a plastic or nonconductive carbon-loaded plastic composite. The wall strength of the case having a thin ceramic ring in the middle may be increased by bonding a supporting material across the ceramic-metal joints with a nonconductive adhesive, either on the inside or outside of the battery case, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> If a braze is used to attach the insulative partition to the conductive case portions, a braze material is chosen that can withstand contact with the electrolyte at high potentials without corroding; it is preferably Au-based, with a high % Au for electrochemical stability. Optionally, the braze may be protected from the electrolyte with a protective covering, which may comprise a polymer such as parylene, polyimide, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), acrylic resin, epoxy resin, or urethane resin, or a metal such as gold, platinum, or aluminum, on top of the brazing material to prevent corrosion at high voltage in electrolyte. This is particularly advantageous for the positive side of the case. The protective covering may be applied by vapor deposition, plating, coating, or the like. A metallic covering of gold or the like may be advantageously deposited on the braze without sticking to the ceramic, thereby ensuring that a bridge is not inadvertently formed across the ceramic insulative partition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In typical battery designs, some of the internal volume of the battery is reserved to make the internal attachment from the wound electrodes to the feedthrough pin. This inactive volume or &ldquo;headspace&rdquo; decreases the energy density of the battery. With the bipolar electronics package of the present invention, the headspace is virtually eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, battery assembly is simplified with this inventive package. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the negative electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, separator <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and positive electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are wound around a mandrel (not shown) to form a &ldquo;jellyroll&rdquo; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The positive electrode has one or more tabs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the negative electrode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has one or more tabs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that will be later attached to the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The tabs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the positive electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extend in opposite direction to the tabs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the negative electrode. The positive tabs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are preferably aluminum or an aluminum alloy, and the negative tabs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are preferably nickel or a nickel alloy or titanium or a titanium alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the jellyroll <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the tabs extending outside of the case. A first end cap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is then fit into place, sandwiching the first set of tabs (negative or positive) in the interface between the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the first end cap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The first end cap is then laser welded to the case, simultaneously connecting the first set of tabs to the first end of the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to extending the tabs outside of the case and then sandwiching them between the case and the end cap, the tabs may be first welded to the inside of the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> before installing the end cap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The battery is then filled with electrolyte from the opposite, open end of the case. After filling, a second end cap <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is positioned and hermetically sealed with the second set of tabs sandwiched in the end cap&mdash;tubular case wall interface. The battery then undergoes formation cycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The technique of sandwiching positive electrode tabs between a tubular case wall and end cap has been described earlier in pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/842,790 entitled, &ldquo;LITHIUM BATTERY SUITABLE FOR HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES,&rdquo; which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The battery of this design is ideally used with spring contacts contacting the end caps. Alternatively, the end caps do not necessarily need to be flat, and may have features drawn in, welded on, or otherwise coupled to them for electrical connection to provide power to a device. Furthermore, the end caps may be of different physical characteristics, such as geometry for devices in which polarity matters to avoid incorrect installation. For example, one end may be square and the other round. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>I, the insulative partition <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> forms substantially the entire tubular case wall, with end caps <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> carrying the charge. Metal rings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are hermetically sealed to the ends of insulative partition <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The tabs of the electrodes in the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are sandwiched between the metal rings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the end caps <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, metal rings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are illustrated as simple washers and end caps <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are illustrated as simple disks. However, other structures may be used for the metal rings and the end caps, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>I. For these configurations where the end cap is being inserted within a hole in the metal ring, as opposed to merely being welded to a flat surface as in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, it is preferable that the end cap be slightly tapered for ease of insertion into the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, insulative partition <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be sealed to conductive case portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by mating threads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. In that case, insulative partition <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is preferably plastic. End cap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and conductive case portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> sandwich electrode tabs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and end cap <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and conductive case portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> sandwich electrode tabs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of jellyroll <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, this invention may take on a variety of forms, including those having elliptical (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) or rectangular (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>) cross sections. The invention is not limited to use with a jellyroll-type electrode assembly.
