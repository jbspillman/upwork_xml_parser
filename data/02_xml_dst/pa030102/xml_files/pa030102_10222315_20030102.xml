<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to methods and apparatuses for observing chemical substances and processes, such as liquid chemical titrations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many chemistry practitioners rely on visual observations to determine when chemical processes and reactions are complete. For example, one conventional technique for determining the concentration of an acid is to titrate the acid by adding a basic solution of a known concentration to the acid until the endpoint is achieved. When the acid/base solution reaches the end point (i.e., the point at which the exact amount of necessary base has been added to completely react with the acid), the color of a chemical indicator in the acid/base solution changes. The practitioner can then calculate the concentration of the acid by measuring the quantity of the base that was required to reach the end point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One characteristic feature of the technique described above is that the chemical indicator may change color very rapidly. Accordingly, the practitioner must pay close attention to the process to determine exactly when the color change begins. Another characteristic feature is that the color change may initially be subtle, again requiring close attention on the part of the practitioner. Accordingly, a drawback with this technique is that it can be difficult to accurately and consistently determine the end point of the target chemical, particularly if the practitioner fails to observe the initial color change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One approach to addressing the foregoing drawback is to conduct the titration process in a flat-bottomed vessel such as an Erlenmeyer flask, and place the bottom of the flask against a white background, such as a sheet of paper or paper towel. By viewing the chemical solution against a white background, the practitioner can more readily determine when the solution changes color. However, this approach can have several additional drawbacks. For example, if the practitioner uses a slightly differently colored background material for successive titrations, the practitioner may not achieve consistent or repeatable titration results. Furthermore, the practitioner may wish to move the flask to achieve an optimal viewing angle, which can be awkward if the practitioner must also move a piece of paper or paper towel held against a surface of the flask. Still further, the practitioner&apos;s view of the chemical solution in the flask may be distorted by the curvature of the flask at the juncture between the bottom of the flask and the walls of the flask, particularly when the volume of the chemical in the flask is relatively small. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed toward apparatuses and methods for observing chemical substances. A vessel in accordance with one aspect of the invention includes a base portion and an optically transmissive wall portion projecting away from the base portion at an interface region. The base portion and the wall portion define an exterior region and an interior region, with the interior region being configured to contain a chemical substance and having an opening configured to removably receive the chemical substance. The vessel further includes a background material having a first surface and a second surface facing opposite from the first surface. The first surface of the background material is fixedly attached to the base portion and/or the interface region and is visible through the wall portion of the vessel from the exterior region of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, the background material can include a paint layer disposed adjacent to the interior or the exterior surface of the vessel. Alternatively, the background material can be integrated with the vessel between an inner surface and an outer surface of the vessel. The background material can have a single hue, such as white or black, or alternatively, the background material can have a plurality of hues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention is also directed toward a method for visually monitoring a chemical substance. In one aspect of the invention, the method can include disposing a chemical substance in a vessel that includes a base portion and a wall portion extending away from the base portion at an interface region. The method can further include positioning the chemical substance at least proximate to a background material fixedly attached to the vessel and covering at least a part of the base portion and/or at least part of the interface region. The method can still further include moving the vessel and the background material as a unit and viewing the chemical substance and the background material simultaneously through a transparent region of the wall portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention is also directed toward a method for forming a vessel for observing a chemical substance. In one aspect of the invention, the method can include forming a base portion of the vessel and forming an at least partially transparent wall portion depending from and extending away from the base portion at an interface region. The base portion and the wall portion define an exterior region and an interior region, with the interior region being configured to contain the chemical substance and having an opening configured to removably receive the chemical substance. The method can still further include fixedly applying a background material to the base portion and/or the interface region, with the background material having a surface visible through the wall portion from the exterior region of the vessel.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure describes vessels for supporting chemical substances and methods for making and using such vessels. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to provide a thorough understanding of these embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have several additional embodiments, or that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a top isometric view of a vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having a fixedly attached background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a generally flat base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> connected to an upwardly extending wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at an interface region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the interface region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> can be integrally formed with each other. Alternatively, the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can initially be separate from the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and can subsequently be joined at the interface region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In either embodiment, the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the interface region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> each have an external surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that defines an exterior region <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> outside the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and an internal surface <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> that defines an interior region <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> inside the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The interior region <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that allows a liquid, gel, solid or gaseous chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to be placed within the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the medium (such as glass or plastic) forming the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the interface region <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is generally transparent or otherwise optically transmissive. Accordingly, a practitioner can view the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> from the exterior region <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In one aspect of this embodiment, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the external surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. For example, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can form a layer having an interior-facing surface <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> facing toward the interior region <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and an exterior-facing surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> facing toward the external region <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Because both the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are transparent, the practitioner can view the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> against the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, as indicated by line of sight &ldquo;L.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can have several configurations, and in each configuration, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be fixedly attached to the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can include a sheet of paper, plastic, or other material that is adhesively attached to the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can include a pigment (such as a paint) that is directly applied to the external surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, the pigment can be sprayed or brushed onto the external surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In either of these embodiments, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can cover part or all of the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can cover other parts of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in addition to or in lieu of the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, as will be described in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect of an embodiment of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can have a single color or hue, such as white, black or any other suitable color. The color of the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be selected to make the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> or selected constituents of the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> more clearly visible. In other embodiments, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can have more than one color, as will be described in greater detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In any of these embodiments, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be generally opaque or, alternatively, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be translucent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can have an Erlenmeyer flask configuration. Accordingly, the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can be generally circular and the wall portion <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can include an frustro-conical section adjacent to the base portion <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and a cylindrical section above the frustro-conical. In other embodiments, the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can have other shapes, for example, a generally cylindrical shape as will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can also include markings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, such a graduation markings <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a content label <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, and/or a manufacturer&apos;s logo <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can include more or fewer markings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a method in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the practitioner can use the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to titrate the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the practitioner can place a magnetic stirrer <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> in the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and can place the vessel on an electric stir plate <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As the stirrer <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> circulates the contents of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the practitioner can add a titrating agent to the interior region <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the vessel through the opening <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> while viewing the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> against the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Once the practitioner notes a change in color of the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (or a change in color of an indicator dye added to the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>), the practitioner halts the flow of titrating agent into the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and measures the total amount of titrating agent added to the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used in accordance with other embodiments of the invention. For example, the practitioner can observe the contents of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> without placing the vessel on the stir plate <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the practitioner can observe the formation of a precipitate within the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, in addition to or in lieu of observing a color change of the contents of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as will be described in greater detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In still further embodiments, the practitioner can use the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in other ways, for example, to observe other types of chemicals and/or chemical reactions, so long as the practitioner is able to view the contents of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> against the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> One feature of an embodiment of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is that the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is fixedly attached to the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. An advantage of this feature is that the practitioner can move the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> without having to separately support and move an adjacent piece of background material, such a sheet of paper or paper towel. Accordingly, an embodiment of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is simpler and easier to use than some conventional arrangements in which the practitioner must keep the vessel aligned with a suitable background while observing the contents of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of this feature is that the color of the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can remain consistent from one vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to another because the vessel manufacturer can control the constituent(s) used for the background material. Accordingly, practitioners can obtain more reliable and consistent results when using several different vessels <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Still another advantage is that the interior-facing surface <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be positioned tightly against the external surface <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. Accordingly, the interior-facing surface <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> can be protected from environmental hazards, such as moisture and other contaminants that can discolor the interior-facing surface <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. As a result, the background material <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can retain its initial color for longer than can some conventional detached background materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side elevational view of a vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> having a background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> configured in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, a wall portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and an interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> between the base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and the wall portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can include a lower part <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> adjacent to the base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and an upper part <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> adjacent to the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can initially be in a liquid form and can be applied to the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by canting the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at an angle and partially immersing the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in a volume of the liquid background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can have an elliptical periphery <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> that extends around the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> into the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can extend upwardly beyond the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> to cover part of the wall portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and can accordingly have a more highly canted, elliptical periphery <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In other embodiments, the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can have other shapes and configurations, so long as the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> covers at least part of the base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and/or at least part of the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One feature of an embodiment of the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is that the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> covers at least part of the base portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. An advantage of this feature is that the practitioner can view the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> within the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> against both the lower part <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and the upper part <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> of the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the practitioner can be more likely to detect a change in the appearance of the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> immediately after the change occurs. Another feature of an embodiment of the vessel <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is that the periphery <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> of the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> has an elliptical shape. Accordingly, the background material <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can cover part of the interface region <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and/or the wall portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, while the remainder of the wall portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is uncovered to give the practitioner a clear view of the chemical substance <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C are cross-sectional side elevational views of a portion of a vessel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> having background materials applied in accordance with further embodiments of the invention. Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the vessel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can include a base portion <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> attached at an interface region <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to a wall portion <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The wall portion <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the interface region <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, and the base portion <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> can each have an internal surface <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> and an external surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>.
