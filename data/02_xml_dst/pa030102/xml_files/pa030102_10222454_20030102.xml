<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The electrophoretic display (EPD) is a non-emissive device based on the electrophoresis phenomenon influencing charged pigment particles suspended in a solvent. This general type of display was first proposed in 1969. An EPD typically comprises a pair of opposed, spaced-apart plate-like electrodes, with spacers predetermining a certain distance between the electrodes. One of the electrodes is typically transparent. A suspension composed of a colored solvent and suspended charged pigment particles is enclosed between the two plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> When a voltage difference is imposed between the two electrodes, the pigment particles migrate by attraction to the plate of polarity opposite that of the pigment particles. Thus the color showing at the transparent plate may be determined by selectively charging the plates to be either the color of the solvent or the color of the pigment particles. Reversal of plate polarity will cause the particles to migrate back to the opposite plate, thereby reversing the color. Intermediate color density (or shades of gray) due to intermediate pigment density at the transparent plate may be obtained by controlling the voltage or charging time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Among the advantages of an electrophoretic display (EPD) over other types of flat panel displays is the very low power consumption. This salient advantage makes EPDs particularly suitable for portable and battery powered devices such as laptops, cell phones, personal digital assistants, portable electronic medical and diagnostic devices, global positioning system devices, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent undesired movements of the particles such as sedimentation, partitions were proposed between the two electrodes for dividing the space into smaller cells. See, e.g., M. A Hopper and V. Novotny, IEEE Trans. Electr. Dev., Vol ED 26, No. 8, pp 1148-1152 (1979). However, in the case of the partition-type EPD, some difficulties are encountered in the formation of the partitions and the process of enclosing the suspension. Furthermore, it is also difficult to keep different colors of suspensions separate from each other in the partition-type EPD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to enclose the suspension in microcapsules. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,961,804 and 5,930,026 describe microencapsulated EPDs. These displays have a substantially two dimensional arrangement of microcapsules each containing an electrophoretic composition comprising a dielectric fluid with charged pigment particles suspended therein and the particles visually contrast with the dielectric solvent. The microcapsules can be formed by interfacial polymerization, in-situ polymerization or other known methods such as in-liquid curing or simple/complex coacervation. The microcapsules, after their formation, may be injected into a cell housing two spaced-apart electrodes, or they may be &ldquo;printed&rdquo; into or coated on a transparent conductor film. The microcapsules may also be immobilized within a transparent matrix or binder that is itself sandwiched between the two electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The EPDs prepared by these prior art processes, in particular the microencapsulation process, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,930,026, No. 5,961,804, and No. 6,017,584, have several shortcomings. For example, the EPDs manufactured by the microencapsulation process suffer from sensitivity to environmental changes (in particular sensitivity to moisture and temperature) due to the wall chemistry of the microcapsules. Secondly the EPDs based on the microcapsules have poor scratch resistance due to the thin wall and large particle size of the microcapsules. To improve the handleability of the display, microcapsules are embedded in a large quantity of polymer matrix which results in a slow response time due to the large distance between the two electrodes and a low contrast ratio due to the low payload of pigment particles. It is also difficult to increase the surface charge density on the pigment particles because charge-controlling agents tend to diffuse to the water/oil interface during the microencapsulation process. The low charge density or zeta potential of the pigment particles in the microcapsules also results in a slow response rate. Furthermore, because of the large particle size and broad size distribution of the microcapsules, the prior art EPD of this type has poor resolution and addressability for color applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Recently an improved EPD technology was disclosed in co-pending applications, U.S. Ser. No. 09/518,488, filed on Mar. 3, 2000 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/784,972, filed on Feb. 25, 2001. The cells of the improved EPD are formed from a plurality of microcups which are formed integrally with one another as portions of a structured two-dimensional array assembly. Each microcup of the array assembly is filled with a suspension or dispersion of charged pigment particles in a dielectric solvent, and sealed to form an electrophoretic cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The substrate web upon which the microcups are formed includes a display addressing array comprising pre-formed conductor film, such as ITO conductor lines. The conductor film (ITO lines) is coated with a radiation curable polymer precursor layer. The film and precursor layer are then exposed imagewise to radiation to form the microcup wall structure. Following exposure, the precursor material is removed from the unexposed areas, leaving the cured microcup walls bonded to the conductor film/support web. The imagewise exposure may be accomplished by UV or other forms of radiation through a photomask to produce an image or predetermined pattern of exposure of the radiation curable material coated on the conductor film. Although it is generally not required, the mask may be positioned and aligned with respect to the conductor film, i.e., ITO lines, so that the transparent mask portions align with the spaces between ITO lines, and the opaque mask portions align with the ITO material (intended for microcup cell floor areas). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the microcup array may be prepared by a process including embossing a thermoplastic or thermoset precursor layer coated on a conductor film with a pre-patterned male mold, followed by releasing the mold. The precursor layer may be hardened by radiation, cooling, solvent evaporation, or other means during or after the embossing step. This novel micro-embossing method is disclosed in the co-pending application, U.S. Ser. No. 09/518,488, filed Mar. 3, 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Solvent-resistant, thermomechanically stable microcups having a wide range of size, shape, pattern and opening ratio can be prepared by either one of the aforesaid methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The manufacture of a monochrome EPD from a microcup assembly involves filling the microcups with a single pigment suspension composition, sealing the microcups, and finally laminating the sealed array of microcups with a second conductor film pre-coated with an adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For a color EPD, its preparation from a microcup assembly involves sequential selective opening and filling of predetermined microcup subsets. The process includes laminating or coating the pre-formed microcups with a layer of positively working photoresist, selectively opening a certain number of the microcups by imagewise exposing the positive photoresist, followed by developing the resist, filling the opened cups with a colored electrophoretic fluid, and sealing the filled microcups by a sealing process. These steps may be repeated to create sealed microcups filled with electrophoretic fluids of different colors. Thus, the array may be filled with different colored compositions in predetermined areas to form a color EPD. Various known pigments and dyes provide a wide range of color options for both solvent phase and suspended particles. Known fluid application and filling mechanisms may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The sealing of the microcups after they are filled with a dispersion of charged pigment particles in a dielectric fluid can be accomplished by overcoating the electrophoretic fluid with a solution containing a thermoplastic or thermoset precursor. To reduce or eliminate the degree of intermixing during and after the overcoating process, it is highly advantageous to use a sealing composition that is immiscible with the electrophoretic fluid and preferably has a specific gravity lower than the dielectric fluid. The sealing is then accomplished by hardening the precursor by solvent evaporation, interfacial reaction, moisture, heat, radiation, or a combination of curing mechanisms. Alternatively, the sealing can be accomplished by dispersing a thermoplastic or thermoset precursor in the electrophoretic fluid before the filling step. The thermoplastic or thermoset precursor is immiscible with the dielectric solvent and has a specific gravity lower than that of the solvent and the pigment particles. After filling, the thermoplastic or thermoset precursor phase separates from the electrophoretic fluid and forms a supernatant layer at the top of the fluid. The sealing of the microcups is then conveniently accomplished by hardening the precursor layer by solvent evaporation, interfacial reaction, moisture, heat, or radiation. UV radiation is the preferred method to seal the microcups, although a combination of two or more curing mechanisms as described above may be used to increase the throughput of sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The improved EPDs may also be manufactured by a synchronized roll-to-roll photolithographic exposure process as described in the co-pending application, U.S. Ser. No. 09/784,972, filed on Feb. 25, 2001. A photomask may be synchronized in motion with the support web using mechanisms such as coupling or feedback circuitry or common drives to maintain the coordinated motion (i.e., to move at the same speed). Following exposure, the web moves into a development area where the unexposed material is removed to form the microcup wall structure. The microcups and ITO lines are preferably of selected size and coordinately aligned with the photomask, so that each completed display cell (i.e., filled and sealed microcup) may be discretely addressed and controlled by the display driver. The ITO lines may be pre-formed by either a wet or a dry etching process on the substrate web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For making color displays from the microcup array, the synchronized roll-to-roll exposure photolithographic process also enables continuous web processes of selective opening, filling and sealing of pre-selected subsets of the microcup array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The microcup array may be temporarily sealed by laminating or coating with a positive-acting photoresist composition, imagewise exposing through a corresponding photomask, and developing the exposed area with a developer to selectively open a desired subset of the microcups. Known laminating and coating mechanisms may be employed. The term &ldquo;developer&rdquo; in this context refers to a suitable known means for selectively removing the exposed photoresist, while leaving the unexposed photoresist in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Thus, the array may be sequentially filled with several different color compositions (typically three primary colors) in a pre-determined cell pattern. For example, the imagewise exposure process may employ a positively working photoresist top laminate or coating which initially seals the empty microcups. The microcups are then exposed through a mask (e.g., a loop photomask in the described roll-to-roll process) so that only a first selected subset of microcups are exposed. Development with a developer removes the exposed photoresist and thus opens the first microcup subset to permit filling with a selected color pigment dispersion composition, and sealing by one of the methods described herein. The exposure and development process is repeated to expose and open a second selected microcup subset, for filling with a second pigment dispersion composition, with subsequent sealing. Finally, the remaining photoresist is removed and the third subset of microcups is filled and sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) may also be prepared by the method as described above when the electrophoretic fluid is replaced by a suitable liquid crystal composition having the ordinary refractive index matched to that of the isotropic cup material. In the &ldquo;on&rdquo; state, the liquid crystal in the microcups is aligned to the field direction and is transparent. In the &ldquo;off&rdquo; state, the liquid crystal is not aligned and scatters light. To maximize the light scattering effect of the LCDs, the diameter of the microcups is typically in the range of 0.5-10 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The roll-to-roll process may be employed to carry out a sequence of processes on a single continuous web, by carrying and guiding the web to a plurality of process stations in sequence. In other words, the microcups may be formed, filled or coated, developed, sealed, and laminated in a continuous sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition to the manufacture of microcup displays, the synchronized roll-to-roll process may be adapted to the preparation of a wide range of structures or discrete patterns for electronic devices formable upon a support web substrate, e.g., patterned conductor films, flexible circuit boards and the like. As in the process and apparatus for EPD microcups described herein, a pre-patterned photomask is prepared which includes a plurality of photomask portions corresponding to structural elements of the subject device. Each such photomask portion may have a pre-selected area of transparency or opacity to radiation so as to form an image of such a structural element upon the correspondingly aligned portion of the web during exposure. The method may be used for selective curing of structural material, or may be used to expose positively or negatively acting photoresist material during manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Because these multiple-step processes may be carried out roll-to-roll continuously or semi-continuously, they are suitable for high volume and low cost production. These processes are also efficient and inexpensive as compared to other processes for manufacturing display products. The improved EPD involving microcups is not sensitive to environment, such as humidity and temperature. The display is thin, flexible, durable, easy-to-handle, and format-flexible. Since the EPD comprises cells of favorable aspect ratio and well-defined shape and size, the bi-stable reflective display has excellent color addressability, high contrast ratio and color saturation, fast switching rate and response time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Sealing of the microcups by a continuous web process is one of the most critical steps in the roll-to-roll manufacturing of the improved EPDs. In order to prepare a high quality display, the sealing layer must have at least the following characteristics: (1) free of defects such as entrapped air bubble, pin holes, cracking or leaking, etc; (2) good film integrity and barrier properties against the display fluid such as dielectric fluids for EPDs; and (3) good coating and adhesion properties. Since most of the dielectric solvents used in EPDs are of low surface tension and low viscosity, it has been a major challenge to achieve a seamless, defect-free sealing with good adhesion properties for the microcups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that microcups filled with a display fluid such as an electrophoretic fluid can be sealed seamlessly and free of defects by a continuous web process using a novel sealing overcoat composition comprising the following ingredients: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> (1) a solvent or solvent mixture which is immiscible with the display fluid in the microcups and exhibits a specific gravity less than that of the display fluid; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (2) a thermoplastic elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Compositions containing at least a thermoplastic elastomer having good compatibility with the microcups and good barrier properties against the display fluid are particularly useful. Examples of useful thermoplastic elastomers include di-block, tri-block or multi-block copolymers represented by the formulas ABA or (AB)n in which A is styrene, &agr;-methylstyrene, ethylene, propylene or norbonene; B is butadiene, isoprene, ethylene, proplyene, butylene, dimethoylsiloxane or propylene sulfide; and A and B cannot be the same in the formula. The number, n, is &gE;1, preferably 1-10. Representative copolymers include poly(styrene-b-butadiene), poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene), poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene), poly(styrene-b-ethylene/butylene-b-styrene), poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-styrene), poly((&agr;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene), poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene-b-&agr;-methylstyrene), poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-propylene sulfide-b-&agr;-methylstyrene), and poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-&agr;-methylstyrene). A review of the preparation of the thermoplastic elastomers can be found in N. R. Legge, G. Holden, and H. E. Schroeder ed., &ldquo;Thermoplastic Elastomers&rdquo;, Hanser Publisher (1987). Commercially available styrene block copolymers such as Kraton D and G series from Shell Chemical Company are particularly useful. Crystalline rubbers such as poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-5-methylene-2-norbornene) or EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer) rubbers and their grafted copolymers have also been found very useful. Not to be bound by the theory, it is believed that the hard block of the thermoplastic elastomers phase separates during or after the drying of the sealing overcoat and serves as the physical crosslinker of the soft continuous phase. The sealing composition of the present invention significantly enhances the modulus and film integrity of the sealing layer throughout the coating and drying processes. Thermoplastic elastomers having low critical surface tension (lower than 40 dyne/cm) and high modulus or Shore A hardness (higher than 60) have been found useful probably because of their favorable wetting property and film integrity over the display fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic elastomer is dissolved in a solvent or solvent mixture which is immiscible with the display fluid in the microcups and exhibits a specific gravity less than that of the display fluid. Low surface tension solvents are preferred for the overcoating composition because of their better wetting properties over the microcup surface and the electrophoretic fluid. Solvents or solvent mixtures having a surface tension lower than 35 dyne/cm are preferred. A surface tension lower than 30 dyne/cm is more preferred. Suitable solvents include alkanes (preferably C<highlight><subscript>6-12 </subscript></highlight>alkanes such as heptane, octane or Isopar solvents from Exxon Chemical Company, nonane, decane and their isomers), cycloalkanes (preferably C<highlight><subscript>6-12 </subscript></highlight>cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane, decalin and the like), alkylbenzenes (preferably mono- or di-C<highlight><subscript>1-6</subscript></highlight>alkyl benzenes such as toluene, xylene and the like), alkyl esters (preferably C<highlight><subscript>2-5</subscript></highlight>alkyl esters such as ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate and the like) and C<highlight><subscript>3-5 </subscript></highlight>alkyl alcohols (such as isopropanol and the like and their isomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In addition to the fact that the electrophoretic cells prepared from microcups may be sealed seamlessly and free of defects by a continuous web process using this novel sealing composition, the composition also has many other advantages. For example, it also exhibits good wetting properties over the filled microcups throughout the coating process and develops a good film integrity over the display fluid even before the solvent evaporates completely. As a result, the integrity of the coating is maintained and no dewetting or beading on the electrophoretic fluid is observed. In addition, the composition of the present invention enables the continuous sealing of wider microcups, particularly those having a width greater than 100 microns. Wider microcups are preferred in some applications because of their higher microcup opening-to-wall ratio and better display contrast ratio. Furthermore, the sealing composition of the present invention enables the formation of a sealing layer less than 3 microns thick which is typically difficult to achieve by using traditional sealing compositions. The thinner sealing layer shortens the distance between the top and bottom electrodes and results in a faster switching rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Co-solvents and wetting agents may also be included in the composition to improve the adhesion of the sealant to the microcups and provides a wider coating process latitude. Other ingredients such as crosslinking agents, vulcanizers, multifunctional monomers or oligomers, and high Tg polymers that are miscible with one of the blocks of the thermoplastic elastomer are also highly useful to enhance the physicomechanical properties of the sealing layer during or after the overcoating process. The sealed microcups may be post treated by UV radiation or thermal baking to further improve the barrier properties. The adhesion of the sealing layer to the microcups may also be improved by the post-curing reaction, probably due to the formation of an interpenetration network at the microcup-sealing layer inter-phase.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;microcup&rdquo; refers to the cup-like indentations, which may be created by methods such as micro-embossing or imagewise exposure as described in the co-pending patent applications identified above. Likewise, the plural form &ldquo;microcups&rdquo; in a collective context may in general refer to the microcup assembly comprising a plurality of such microcups integrally formed or joined to make a structured two-dimensional microcup array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;cell&rdquo;, in the context of the present invention, is intended to mean the single unit formed from a sealed microcup. The cells are filled with charged pigment particles dispersed in a solvent or solvent mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;well-defined&rdquo;, when describing the microcups or cells, is intended to indicate that the microcup or cell has a definite shape, size, pattern and aspect ratio which are pre-determined according to the specific parameters of the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;aspect ratio&rdquo; is a commonly known term in the art and is the depth to width ratio or the depth to diameter ratio of the microcup opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;imagewise exposure&rdquo; means exposure of radiation-curable material or photoresist composition to radiation, such as UV, using one of the methods of the invention, whereby the portions of the material so exposed are controlled to form a pattern or &ldquo;image&rdquo; corresponding to the structure of the microcups, e.g., the exposure is restricted to the portions of the material corresponding to the microcup walls, leaving the microcup floor portion unexposed. In the case of selectively opening photoresist on predetermined portions of the microcup array, imagewise exposure means exposure on the portions of material corresponding to the cup opening, leaving the microcup walls unexposed. The pattern or image may be formed by such methods as exposure through a photomask, or alternatively by controlled particle beam exposure, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> II. The Microcup Array </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are schematic cross-section views of an exemplary microcup array assembly embodiment, simplified for clarity, showing a microcup array assembly (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of three microcup cells (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each cell (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of array (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) comprises two electrode plates (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), at least one of which is transparent (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), such as an ITO electrode, the electrodes (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) bounding two opposite faces of the cell (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The microcup cell array assembly (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) comprises a plurality of cells which are disposed adjacent to one another within a plane to form a layer of cells (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) enclosed between the two electrodes layers (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). Three exemplary cells (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) are shown, bounded by their respective electrode plates (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) (transparent) and (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) (back plates), it being understood that a large number of such cells are preferably arrayed two-dimensionally (to the right/left and in/out of the plane in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to form a sheet-like display of any selected area and two-dimensional shape. Likewise, several microcup cells may be bounded by a single electrode plate (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), although, for clarity, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example in which each cell (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is bounded by separate electrode plates (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) having the width of a single cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The cells are of well-defined shape and size and are filled with a colored dielectric solvent (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) in which charged pigment particles (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) are suspended and dispersed. The cells (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) may be each filled with the same composition of pigment and solvent (e.g., in a monochrome display) or may be filled with different compositions of pigment and solvent (e.g., in a color display). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows three different color combinations as indicated by the different hatch pattern in each cell (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the solvents being designated (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) respectively, and the pigment particles being designated (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The microcup cells (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) each comprise enclosing walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) bounding the cells on the sides (within the plane of array (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>)) and floor (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) bounding the cell on one face, in this example the face adjacent to electrode (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). On the opposite face (adjacent electrode (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>)) each cell comprises sealing cap portion (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). Where the sealing cap portion is adjacent to the transparent electrode (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the sealing cap (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) comprises a transparent composition. Although in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the floor (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) and the sealing cap (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) are shown as separate cell portions distinct from adjacent electrodes (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) respectively, alternative embodiments of the microcup array (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the invention may comprise an integral floor/electrode structure or an integral sealing cap/electrode structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic cross-section of the EPD of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but with two of the cells charged (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), to cause the pigment to migrate to one plate. When a voltage difference is imposed between the two electrodes (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), the charged particles (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) migrate (i.e., toward electrode (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) depending on the charge of the particle and electrode), such that either the color of the pigment particle (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) or the color of the solvent (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) is seen through the transparent conductor film (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). At least one of the two conductors (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) is patterned (separately addressable portions ) to permit a selective electric field to be established with respect to either each cell or with respect to a pre-defined group of cells (e.g., to form a pixel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, two of the cells are shown charged (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), in which the pigment (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) has migrated to the respective transparent electrode plates (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The remaining cell (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) remains neutral and pigment (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is dispersed throughout solvent (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C shows the contours of an exemplary portion of a microcup array, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> showing a perspective view, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> showing a plan view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> showing an elevation view, the vertical scale being exaggerated for clarity. For reflective EPDs, the opening area of each individual microcup may preferably be in the range of about 10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, more preferably from about 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The width w of the microcup (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) (distance between adjacent walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>)) may vary over a wide range, and is selectable to suit the desired final display characteristics. The width w of the microcup openings preferably is in the range of from about 15 to about 450 &mgr;m, and more preferably from about 25 to about 300 &mgr;m from edge to edge of the openings. Each microcup may form a small segment of a pixel of the final display, or may be a full pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The wall thickness t relative to the cup width w may vary over a large range, and is selectable to suit the desired final display characteristics. The microcup wall thickness is typically from about 0.01 to about 1 times the microcup width, and more preferably about 0.05 to about 0.25 times the microcup width. The opening-to-total area ratio is preferably in the range of about 0.1 to about 0.98, more preferably from about 0.3 to about 0.95. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The microcup wall height h (which defines the cup depth) is shown exaggerated beyond its typical proportional dimensions for clarity. For EPDs, the height of the microcups is typically in the range of about 5 to about 100 microns (&mgr;ms), preferably from about 10 to about 50 microns. For LCDs, the height is typically in the range of about 1 to 10 microns and more preferably from about 2 to 5 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For simplicity and clarity, a square microcup arranged in a linear two-dimensional array assembly is assumed in the description herein of the microcup array assembly of the invention. However, the microcup need not be square, it may be rectangular, circular, or a more complex shape if desired. For example, the microcups may be hexagonal and arranged in a hexagonal close-packed array, or alternatively, triangular cups may be oriented to form hexagonal sub-arrays, which in turn are arranged in a hexagonal close-packed array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In general, the microcups can be of any shape, and their sizes, pattern and shapes may vary throughout the display. This may be advantageous in the color EPD. In order to maximize the optical effect, microcups having a mixture of different shapes and sizes may be produced. For example, microcups filled with a dispersion of the red color may have a different shape or size from the green microcups or the blue microcups. Furthermore, a pixel may consist of different numbers of microcups of different colors. For example, a pixel may consist of a number of small green microcups, a number of large red microcups;, and a number of small blue microcups. It is not necessary to have the same shape and number for the three colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The openings of the microcups may be round, square, rectangular, hexagonal, or any other shapes. The partition area between the openings is preferably kept small in order to achieve a high color saturation and contrast while maintaining desirable mechanical properties. Consequently the honeycomb-shaped opening is preferred over, for example, the circular opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> III. Preparation Of The Microcup Array </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The microcups may be prepared by microembossing or by photolithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> IIIa. Preparation of Microcups Array by Microembossing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Preparation of the Male Mold </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The male mold may be prepared by any appropriate method, such as a diamond turn process or a photoresist process followed by either etching or electroplating. A master template for the male mold may be manufactured by any appropriate method, such as electroplating. With electroplating, a glass base is sputtered with a thin layer (typically 3000 &angst;) of a seed metal such as chrome inconel. It is then coated with a layer of photoresist and exposed to UV. A mask is placed between the UV and the layer of photoresist. The exposed areas of the photoresist become hardened. The unexposed areas are then removed by washing them with an appropriate solvent. The remaining hardened photoresist is dried and sputtered again with a thin layer of seed metal. The master is then ready for electroforming. A typical material used for electroforming is nickel cobalt. Alternatively, the master can be made of nickel by electroforming or electroless nickel deposition as described in &ldquo;Continuous manufacturing of thin cover sheet optical media&rdquo;, SPIE Proc. Vol. 1663, pp. 324 (1992). The floor of the mold is typically between about 50 to 400 microns. The master can also be made using other microengineering techniques including e-beam writing, dry etching, chemical etching, laser writing or laser interference as described in &ldquo;Replication techniques for micro-optics&rdquo;, SPIE Proc. Vol. 3099, pp. 76-82 (1997). Alternatively, the mold can be made by photomachining using plastics, ceramics or metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The male mold thus prepared typically has protrusions between about 1 to 500 microns, preferably between about 2 to 100 microns, and most preferred about 4 to 50 microns. The male mold may be in the form of a belt, a roller, or a sheet. For continuous manufacturing, the belt type of mold is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Microcup Formation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Micro-cups may be formed either in a batchwise process or in a continuous roll-to-roll process as disclosed in the co-pending application, U.S. Ser. No. 09/784,972, filed on Feb. 25, 2001. The latter offers a continuous, low cost, high throughput manufacturing technology for production of compartments for use in electrophoretic or LCDs. Prior to applying a UV durable resin composition, the mold may be treated with a mold release to aid in the demolding process. The UV curable resin may be degassed prior to dispensing and may optionally contain a solvent. The solvent, if present, readily evaporates. The UV curable resin is dispensed by any appropriate means such as, coating, dipping, pouring and the like, over the male mold. The dispenser may be moving or stationary. A conductor film is overlaid the UV curable resin. Examples of suitable conductor film include transparent conductor ITO on plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthate, polyaramid, polyimide, polycycloolefin, polysulfone, epoxy and their composites. Pressure may be applied, if necessary, to ensure proper bonding between the resin and the plastic and to control the thickness of the floor of the micro-cups. The pressure may be applied using a laminating roller, vacuum molding, press device or any other like means. If the male mold is metallic and opaque, the plastic substrate is typically transparent to the actinic radiation used to cure the resin. Conversely, the male mold can be transparent and the plastic substrate can be opaque to the actinic radiation. To obtain good transfer of the molded features onto the transfer sheet, the conductor film needs to have good adhesion to the UV curable resin which should have a good release property against the mold surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> IIIb. Preparation of Microcup Array by Photolithography </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The photolithographic processes for preparation of the microcup array are described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Top Exposure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the microcup array (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) may be prepared by exposure of a radiation curable material (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) coated by known methods onto a conductor electrode film (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) to UV light (or alternatively other forms of radiation, electron beams and the like) through a mask (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) to form walls (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) corresponding to the image projected through the mask (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). The base conductor film (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is preferably mounted on a supportive substrate base web (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>), which may comprise a plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the photomask (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the dark squares (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) represent the opaque area and the space between the dark squares represents the transparent area (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) of the mask (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). The UV radiates through the transparent area (<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>) onto the radiation curable material (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The exposure is preferably directly onto the radiation curable material (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), i.e., the UV does not pass through the substrate (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) or base conductor (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) (top exposure). For this reason, neither the substrate (<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) nor the conductor (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) needs to be transparent to the UV or other radiation wavelengths employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the exposed areas (<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) become hardened and the unexposed areas (protected by the opaque area (<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) of the mask (<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) are then removed by an appropriate solvent or developer to form the microcups (<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). The solvent or developer is selected from those commonly used for dissolving or reducing the viscosity of radiation curable materials such as methylethylketone (MEK), toluene, acetone, isopropanol or the like. The preparation of the microcups may be similarly accomplished by placing a photomask underneath the conductor film/substrate support web and in this case the UV light radiates through the photomask from the bottom and the substrate needs to be transparent to radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Exposure through Opaque Conductor Lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Still another alternative method for the preparation of the microcup array of the invention by imagewise exposure is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. When opaque conductor lines are used, the conductor lines can be used as the photomask for the exposure from the bottom. Durable microcup walls are formed by additional exposure from the top through a second photomask having opaque lines perpendicular to the conductor lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates the use of both the top and bottom exposure principals to produce the microcup array (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) of the invention. The base conductor film (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) is opaque and line-patterned. The radiation curable material (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), which is coated on the base conductor (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) and substrate (<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), is exposed from the bottom through the conductor line pattern (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) which serves as the first photomask. A second exposure is performed from the &ldquo;top&rdquo; side through the second photomask (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) having a line pattern perpendicular to the conductor lines (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). The spaces (<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) between the lines (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) are substantially transparent to the UV light. In this process, the wall material (<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is cured from the bottom up in one lateral orientation, and cured from the top down in the perpendicular direction, joining to form an integral microcup (<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the unexposed area is then removed by a solvent or developer as described above to reveal the microcups (<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> IV. The Sealing Composition and Process of the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The novel sealing overcoat composition comprises the following ingredients: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (1) a solvent or solvent mixture which is immiscible with the display fluid in the microcups and exhibits a specific gravity less than that of the display fluid; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> (2) a thermoplastic elastomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Compositions containing a thermoplastic elastomer having good compatibility with the microcups and good barrier properties against the display fluid are particularly useful. Examples of useful thermoplastic elastomers include ABA, and (AB)n type of di-block, tri-block, and multi-block copolymers wherein A is styrene, &agr;-methylstyrene, ethylene, propylene or norbonene; B is butadiene, isoprene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, dimethylsiloxane or propylene sulfide; and A and B cannot be the same in the formula. The number, n, is &gE;1, preferably 1-10. Particularly useful are di-block or tri-block copolymers of styrene or &agr;-methylstyrene such as SB (poly(styrene-b-butadiene)), SBS (poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene)), SIS (poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene)), SEBS (poly(styrene-b-ethylene/butylenes-b-styrene)) poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-styrene), poly((&agr;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene), poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene-b-&agr;-methylstyrene), poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-propylene sulfide-b-&agr;-methylstyrene), poly(&agr;-methylstyrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-&agr;-methylstyrene). A review of the preparation of the thermoplastic elastomers can be found in N. R. Legge, G. Holden, and H. E. Schroeder ed., &ldquo;Thermoplastic Elastomers&rdquo;, Hanser Publisher (1987). Commercially available styrene block copolymers such as Kraton D and G series (from Kraton Polymer, Houston, Tex.) are particularly useful. Crystalline rubbers such as poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-5-methylene-2-norbornene) or EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer) rubbers such as Vistalon 6505 (from Exxon Mobil, Houston, Tex.) and their grafted copolymers have also been found very useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Not to be bound by the theory, it is believed that the hard block of the thermoplastic elastomers phase separates during or after the drying of the sealing overcoat and serves as the physical crosslinker of the soft continuous phase. The sealing composition of the present invention significantly enhances the modulus and film integrity of the sealing layer throughout the coating and drying processes of the sealing layer. Thermoplastic elastomers having low critical surface tension (lower than 40 dyne/cm) and high modulus or Shore A hardness (higher than 60) have been found useful probably because of their favorable wetting property and film integrity over the display fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic elastomer is dissolved in a solvent or solvent mixture which is immiscible with the display fluid in the microcups and exhibits a specific gravity less than that of the display fluid. Low surface tension solvents are preferred for the overcoating composition because of their better wetting properties over the microcup walls and the electrophoretic fluid. Solvents or solvent mixtures having a surface tension lower than 35 dyne/cm are preferred. A surface tension of lower than 30 dyne/cm is more preferred. Suitable solvents include alkanes (preferably C<highlight><subscript>6-12 </subscript></highlight>alkanes such as heptane, octane or Isopar solvents from Exxon Chemical Company, nonane, decane and their isomers), cycloalkanes (preferably C<highlight><subscript>6-12 </subscript></highlight>cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and decalin and the like), alkylbezenes (preferably mono- or di-C<highlight><subscript>1-6</subscript></highlight>alkyl benzenes such as toluene, xylene and the like), alkyl esters (preferably C<highlight><subscript>2-5</subscript></highlight>alkyl esters such as ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate and the like) and C<highlight><subscript>3-5 </subscript></highlight>alkyl alcohols (such as isopropanol and the like and their isomers). Mixtures of alkylbenzene and alkane are particularly useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Wetting agents (such as the FC surfactants from 3M Company, Zonyl fluorosurfactants from DuPont, fluoroacrylates, fluoromethacrylates, fluoro-substituted long chain alcohols, perfluoro-substituted long chain carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and Silwet silicone surfactants from OSi, Greenwich, Conn.) may also be included in the composition to improve the adhesion of the sealant to the microcups and provide a more flexible coating process. Other ingredients including crosslinking agents (e.g., bisazides such as 4,4&prime;-diazidodiphenylmethane and 2,6-di-(4&prime;-azidobenzal)-4-methylcyclohexanone), vulcanizers (e.g., 2-benzothiazolyl disulfide and tetramethylthiuram disulfide), multifunctional monomers or oligomers (e.g., hexanediol, diacrylates, trimethylolpropane, triacrylate, divinylbenzene, diallylphthalene), thermal initiators (e.g., dilauroryl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide) and photoinitiators (e.g., isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX), Irgacure 651 and Irgacure 369 from Ciba-Geigy) are also highly useful to enhance the physicomechanical properties of the sealing layer by crosslinking or polymerization reactions during or after the overcoating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The sealing composition is typically overcoated onto partially filled microcups and the overcoated microcups are dried at room temperature. The sealed microcups optionally may be post treated by UV radiation or thermal baking to further improve the barrier properties. The adhesion of the sealing layer to the microcups may also be improved by the post-curing reaction, likely due to the formation of an interpenetration network at the microcup-sealing layer inter-phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> V. Preparation Of Electrophoretic Displays From The Microcup Array </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The preferred process of preparing the electrophoretic cells is illustrated schematically in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the microcup array (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) may be prepared by any of the alternative methods described in Section III above. The unfilled microcup array made by the methods described herein typically comprises a substrate web (<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>) upon which a base electrode (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) is deposited. The microcup walls (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) extend upward from the substrate (<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>) to form the open cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the microcups are filled with a suspension of the charged pigment particles (<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>) in a colored dielectric solvent composition (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>). In the example shown, the composition is the same in each cup, i.e., in a monochrome display. In carrying out the sealing process of the present invention, the microcups are preferably partially filled (to prevent overflow), which can be achieved by diluting the electrophoretic fluid with a volatile solvent (such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, isopropanol, hexane, and perfluoro solvent FC-33 from 3M Co.,) and allowing the volatile solvent to evaporate. When a high boiling point perfluoro solvent such as HT-200 (from Ausimont Co., Thorofare, N.J.) is used as the continuous phase of the display fluid, a perfluoro volatile solvent such as FC-33 is particularly useful to control the level of partial filling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, after filling, the microcups are sealed with the sealing composition of the present invention to form a sealing layer (<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). The sealing composition is typically overcoated onto the partially filled microcups and dried on the display fluid. The sealed microcups optionally may be post treated by UV radiation or thermal baking to further improve the barrier properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>D, the sealed array of electrophoretic microcup cells (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) is laminated with a second conductor film (<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>), preferably by pre-coating the conductor (<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>) with an adhesive layer (<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>) which may be a pressure sensitive adhesive, a hot melt adhesive, or a heat, moisture, or radiation curable adhesive. The laminate adhesive may be post-cured by radiation such as UV through the top conductor film if the latter is transparent to the radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> VI. Preparation Of The Pigment/Solvent Suspension Or Dispersion Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As described herein with respect to the various embodiments of the EPD of the invention, the microcups are preferably filled with charged pigment particles dispersed in a dielectric solvent (e.g., solvent (<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) and pigment particles (<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>.). The dispersion may be prepared according to methods well known in the art, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,017,584, 5,914,806, 5,573,711, 5,403,518, 5,380,362, 4,680,103, 4,285,801, 4,093,534, 4,071,430, and 3,668,106. See also <highlight><italic>IEEE Trans. Electron Devices</italic></highlight>, ED-24, 827 (1977), and <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Phys.,</italic></highlight>49(9), 4820 (1978). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The charged pigment particles visually contrast with the medium in which the particles are suspended. The medium is a dielectric solvent which preferably has a low viscosity and a dielectric constant in the range of about 2 to about 30, preferably about 2 to about 15 for high particle mobility. Examples of suitable dielectric solvents include hydrocarbons such as decahydronaphthalene (DECALIN), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, fatty oils, paraffin oil, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, phenylxylylethane, dodecylbenzene and alkylnaphthalenes, halogenated solvents such as, dichlorobenzotrifluoride, 3,4,5-trichlorobenzotrifluoride, chloropentafluoro-benzene, dichlorononane, pentachlorobenzene, and perfluoro solvents such as perfluorodecalin, perfluorotoluene, perfluoroxylene, FC-43, FC-70 and FC-5060 from 3M Company, St. Paul Minn., low molecular weight halogen containing polymers such as poly(perfluoropropylene oxide) from TCI America, Portland, Oreg., poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) such as Halocarbon Oils from Halocarbon Product Corp., River Edge, N.J., perfluoropolyalkylether such as Galden, HT-200, and Fluorolink from Ausimont (Thorofare, N.J.) or Krytox Oils and Greases K-Fluid Series from DuPont, Del. In one preferred embodiment, poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) is used as the dielectric solvent. In another preferred embodiment, poly(perfluoropropylene oxide) is used as the dielectric solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A non-migrating fluid colorant may be formed from dyes or pigments. Nonionic azo and anthraquinone dyes are particularly useful. Examples of useful dyes include, but are not limited to: Oil Red EGN, Sudan Red, Sudan Blue, Oil Blue, Macrolex Blue, Solvent Blue 35, Pylam Spirit Black and Fast Spirit Black from Pylam Products Co., Ariz., Sudan Black B from Aldrich, Thermoplastic Black X-70 from BASF, and anthraquinone blue, anthraquinone yellow 114, anthraquinone red 111, 135, anthraquinone green 28 from Aldrich. Fluorinated dyes are particularly useful when perfluoro solvents are used. In the case of a pigment, the non-migrating pigment particles for generating the color of the medium may also be dispersed in the dielectric medium. These color particles are preferably uncharged. If the non-migrating pigment particles for generating color in the medium are charged, they preferably carry a charge which is opposite from that of the charged, migrating pigment particles. If both types of pigment particles carry the same charge, then they should have different charge density or different electrophoretic mobility. In any case, the dye or pigment for generating the non-migrating fluid colorant of the medium must be chemically stable and compatible with other components in the suspension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The charged, migrating pigment particles may be organic or inorganic pigments, such as TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, phthalocyanine blue, phthalocyanine green, diarylide yellow, diarylide AAOT Yellow, and quinacridone, azo, rhodamine, perylene pigment series from Sun Chemical, Hansa yellow G particles from Kanto Chemical, and Carbon Lampblack from Fisher. Submicron particle size is preferred. These particles should have acceptable optical characteristics, should not be swollen or softened by the dielectric solvent, and should be chemically stable. The resulting suspension must also be stable against sedimentation, creaming or flocculation under normal operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The migrating pigment particles may exhibit a native charge, or may be charged explicitly using a charge control agent, or may acquire a charge when suspended in the dielectric solvent. Suitable charge control agents are well known in the art; they may be polymeric or non-polymeric in nature, and may also be ionic or non-ionic, including ionic surfactants such as Aerosol OT, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, metal soaps, polybutene succinimide, maleic anhydride copolymers, vinylpyridine copolymers, vinylpyrrolidone copolymer (such as Ganex from International Specialty Products), (meth)acrylic acid copolymers, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate copolymers. Fluorosurfactants are particularly useful as charge controlling agents in perfluorocarbon solvents. These include FC fluorosurfactants such as FC-170C, FC-171, FC-176, FC430, FC431 and FC-740 from 3M Company and Zonyl fluorosurfactants such as Zonyl FSA, FSE, FSN, FSN-100, FSO, FSO-100, FSD and UR from Dupont. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Suitable charged pigment dispersions may be manufactured by any of the well-known methods including grinding, milling, attriting, microfluidizing, and ultrasonic techniques. For example, pigment particles in the form of a fine powder are added to the suspending solvent and the resulting mixture is ball milled or attrited for several hours to break up the highly agglomerated dry pigment powder into primary particles. Although less preferred, a dye or pigment for producing the non-migrating fluid colorant may be added to the suspension during the ball milling process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Sedimentation or creaming of the pigment particles may be eliminated by microencapsulating the particles with suitable polymers to match the specific gravity to that of the dielectric solvent. Microencapsulation of the pigment particles may be accomplished chemically or physically. Typical microencapsulation processes include interfacial polymerization, in-situ polymerization, phase separation, coacervation, electrostatic coating, spray drying, fluidized bed-coating and solvent evaporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> For a black/white EPD, the suspension comprises charged white particles of titanium oxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) dispersed in a black dielectric solution containing a black dye or dispersed uncharged black particles. A black dye or dye mixture such as Pylam Spirit Black and Fast Spirit Black from Pylam Products Co. Ariz., Sudan Black B from Aldrich, Thermoplastic Black X-70 from BASF, or an insoluble black pigment such as carbon black may be used to generate the black color of the solvent. For other colored suspensions, there are many possibilities. For a subtractive color system, the charged TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>particles may be suspended in a dielectric fluid of cyan, yellow or magenta color. The cyan, yellow or magenta color may be generated via the use of a dye or a pigment. For an additive color system, the charged TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>particles may be suspended in a dielectric fluid of red, green or blue color generated also via the use of a dye or a pigment. The red, green, blue color system is preferred for most applications. </paragraph>

A 7.5% solution of polyisoprene (97% cis, from Aldrich) in heptane was then overcoated onto the partially filled cups by a Universal Blade Applicator with an opening of 3 mil. The overcoated microcups were then dried at room temperature. A seamless sealing layer of about 7-8 &mgr;m thickness (dry) with acceptable adhesion and uniformity was formed on the microcup array. No observable entrapped air bubble in the sealed microcups was found under microscope. A second ITO/PET conductor precoated with an adhesive layer was laminated onto the sealed microcups.
