<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the casting of metal strip. It has particular but not exclusive application to the casting of ferrous metal strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to cast metal strip by continuous casting in a twin roll caster. Molten metal is introduced between a pair of contra-rotated horizontal casting rolls which are cooled so that metal shells solidify on the moving roll surfaces and are brought together at the nip between them to produce a solidified strip product delivered downwardly from the nip between the rolls. The term &ldquo;nip&rdquo; is used herein to refer to the general region at which the rolls are closest together. The molten metal may be poured from a ladle into a smaller vessel or series of smaller vessels from which it flows through a metal delivery nozzle located above the nip so as to direct it into the nip between the rolls, so forming a casting pool of molten metal supported on the casting surfaces of the rolls immediately above the nip. This casting pool may be confined between end closure side plates or dams held in sliding engagement with the ends of the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In twin roll casting, eccentricities in the casting rolls can lead to strip thickness variations along the strip. Such eccentricities can arise either due to machining and assembly of the rolls or due to distortion when the rolls are hot possibly due to non-uniform heat flux distribution. Specifically, each revolution of the casting rolls will produce a pattern of thickness variations dependent on eccentricities in the rolls and this pattern will be repeated for each revolution of the casting rolls. Usually the repeating pattern will be generally sinusoidal, but there may be secondary or subsidiary fluctuations within the generally sinusoidal pattern. By the present invention these repeated thickness variations can be very much reduced by imposing a pattern of speed variations in the speed of rotation of the rolls. Compensation in this manner is possible because even small speed variations vary the time of contact of the solidifying metal shells on the rolls within the casting pool and therefore the thickness of the shells which are brought together at the nip. It is thus possible to compensate for an increase in the nip tending to produce a thickening of the strip by an instantaneous acceleration of the rolls so as to decrease the time for shell solidification thereby to produce a compensating tendency for thinning of the strip. Furthermore, varying solidification time will result in varying casting roll temperature distribution which will result in roll shape change and when appropriately matched with initial roll eccentricity will compensate for it. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The illustrated caster comprises a main machine frame, generally identified by the numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which stands up from the factory floor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Frame <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> supports a casting roll carriage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is horizontally movable between an assembly station and a casting station. Carriage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries a pair of parallel casting rolls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which form a nip (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A) in which a casting pool of molten metal is formed and retained between two side plates or dams <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> held in sliding engagement with the ends of the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Molten metal is supplied during a casting operation from a ladle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via a tundish <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, delivery distributor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and nozzle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>into the casting pool. Before assembly above the carriage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, tundish <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, distributor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, nozzle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the side plates are all preheated to temperatures in excess of 1000&deg; C. in appropriate preheat furnaces (not shown). The manner in which these components may be preheated and moved into assembly above the carriage <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is more fully disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,668. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Casting rolls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are contra-rotated through drive shafts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by electric motors <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Rolls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have copper peripheral walls formed with a series of longitudinally extending and circumferentially spaced water cooling passages supplied with cooling water through the roll ends from water supply ducts in the roll drive shafts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which are connected to water supply hoses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through rotary glands <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The roll may typically be about 500 mm diameter and up to 2000 mm long in order to produce strip product approximately the width of the rolls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Pool confinement plates <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are-held against stepped ends <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the rolls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Plates <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are made of a strong refractory material, for example boron nitride, and have scalloped side edges to match the curvature of the stepped ends of the rolls. They can be mounted in plate holders <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which are movable by actuation of a pair of hydraulic cylinder units <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to bring the side plates into engagement with the stepped ends of the casting rolls to form end closures for the molten pool of metal formed on the casting rolls during a casting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> During a casting operation metal from the casting pool solidifies as shells on the moving roll surfaces and the shells are brought together at the nip between them to produce a solidified strip product <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the roll outlet. This product is fed across a guide table <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a pinch roll stand <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> which transports the strip to a standard coiler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> hangs in a loop <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> beneath the caster before it passes to the guide table <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The guide table comprises a series of strip support rolls <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to support the strip before it passes to the pinch roll stand <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Rolls <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are disposed in an array which extends back from the pinch roll stand <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward the caster and curves downwardly at its end remote from the pinch rolls so as to smoothly receive and transport the strip from the loop <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A receptacle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is mounted on the machine frame adjacent the casting station and molten metal can be diverted into this receptacle via an overflow spout <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the distributor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>if there is a severe malfunction during a casting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Tundish <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fitted with a lid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and its floor is stepped at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to form a recess or well <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the bottom of the tundish at its left-hand and as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Molten metal is introduced into the right-hand end of the tundish from the ladle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via an outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and slide gate valve <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. At the bottom of well <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, there is an outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the floor of the tundish to allow molten metal to flow from the tundish via an outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the delivery distributor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the nozzle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The tundish <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fitted with a stopper rod <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and slide gate valve <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to selectively open and close the outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and effectively control the flow of metal through the outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In operation of the illustrated apparatus, molten metal delivered from delivery nozzle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forms a pool <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> above the nip between the rollers, this pool being confined at the ends of the rollers by side closure plates <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which are held against stepped ends of the rollers by actuation of a pair of hydraulic cylinder units. The upper surface of pool <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, generally referred to as the &ldquo;meniscus level&rdquo; rises above the lower end of the delivery nozzle. Accordingly, the lower end of the delivery nozzle is immersed within the casting pool and the nozzle outlet passage extends below the surface of the pool or meniscus level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention the strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the guide table <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> passes under an X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which continuously scans the thickness of the strip along the centre line of the strip to produce a signal which is a continuous measure of thickness variations along the centre line. Because of inevitable eccentricities in the casting roll surfaces, the width of the nip between the rolls will vary during each revolution of the rolls to produce repeated thickness variations along the strip. The thickness variation will generally be sinusoidal and without compensation can be of quite wide amplitude. By the present invention, it is possible to compensate for the variations in nip width by imposing a pattern of speed variations in the speed of rotation of the rolls. This is possible because even small speed variations vary the time of contact of the solidifying metal shells on the rolls within the casting pool and therefore the thickness of the shells which are brought together at the nip. It is thus possible to compensate for an increase in the nip width tending to produce a thickening of the strip by acceleration of the rolls so as to decrease the time for shell solidification thereby to produce a compensating tendency for thinning of the strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, varying the solidification time will result in varying heat transfer into the roll changing the temperature distribution in the casting rolls. Increasing the roll temperature locally causes expansion of that region resulting in the roll bending in a convex manner. By inducing the roll bending appreciably opposite to initial bending, substantial compensation may be made resulting in uniform width gap at the nip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The signals generated by the X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are fed to a controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to produce control signals which are fed directly to the electric motors <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which drive the casting rolls. Control signals for phase and amplitude of speed variations can be derived from direct measurement of strip thickness, or indirect measurement of roll position. Generally, at least one of the casting rolls is supported on mountings which can move laterally of the roll against spring or fluid pressure biasing and it would be feasible to derive control signals by sensing the movement of those mountings or changes in the forces between the rolls. A speed controller operating from oscillations of the casting rolls may be prone to error signals which feed back through the system. On the other hand the strip which leaves the nip hangs in a loop which has the effect of absorbing speed variations so that the strip has essentially constant speed as it passes under the X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the control signals can be developed by a continuous scan to establish a pattern over the whole length of the strip. Typically, this will be a regularly repeating pattern throughout the strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is possible for any strip thickness and casting speed to establish a sensitivity between speed variation and resulting strip thickness variation. Accordingly, the signals derived from X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provide a measure of the frequency and amplitude of speed variation cycles which must be imposed to compensate for the measured thickness variations, the amplitude of the imposed speed variations being the amplitude of the measured thickness variations divided by appropriate sensitivity for the particular casting speed and strip thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To achieve appropriate thickness control, the speed variation signals must be applied in proper phase relationship with the rotation of the rolls, ie during each rotation the pattern of speed variation must match the pattern of roll movements caused by the eccentricities. Proper phase matching is achieved by applying the signals at an initial phase relationship with a reference signal producing one pulse per revolution of the rolls and then varying the phase relationship to produce a minimisation of the amplitude of thickness variations. This may be achieved by tracking or plotting an amplitude error signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is found in practice that the phase adjustment of the control signals can be carried out very quickly by visual tracking because the suppression of the amplitude of the thickness variations is very marked when the correct phase matching is achieved. This is demonstrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> which plots actual results achieved during operation of a strip caster in accordance with the invention. Line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> plots measurements of thickness variations from the centre-line X-ray scanner through periods of no compensation and periods when control signals are applied at various phase relationships. In this particular case maximum suppression was achieved in the region <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> where the control signals were 180&deg; out of phase with the reference signals. It will be seen in this region that the amplitude of the thickness variations was very significantly reduced compared with the regions where no speed compensation was applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to provide more accurate compensation for complex thickness variations, it would be possible in a system according to the invention to apply more than one speed variation cycle for each roll rotation. The secondary cycles could be derived by analysis of the signals derived from the X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the secondary cycles could be obtained from position or force variation signals derived from the casting roll mountings, since the correlation between the X-ray signals and the roll mountings is already established by phase locking the primary signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is also possible, in a system according to the invention to control the speed of rotation of the casting rolls throughout a cast to compensate for a long term variation or drift in the thickness of the strip throughout the cast. Such long term variation can arise, for example, due to temperature run down in the feed metal heat or melt chemistry variations. A separate control signal can be derived from the continuously varying signals produced by X-ray scanner <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by employing a different filter to give an average thickness signal which can be used to determine the mean speed of the casting rolls, this signal being fed direct to the roll drive motors to maintain the correct average thickness of the strip throughout the cast. </paragraph>
