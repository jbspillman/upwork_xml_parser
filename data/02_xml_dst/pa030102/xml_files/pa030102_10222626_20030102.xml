<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the production of nano-particles in general and more particularly to apparatus for producing nano-particles of molybdenum oxide. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nano-particles, that is, particles having average sizes less than about 1 micrometer (i.e., 1 micron) are known in the art and are of interest because their nano-crystalline and/or other nano-scale features dramatically change the properties of the material. For example, certain materials fabricated from nano-particles often possess superior mechanical properties compared with the same material fabricated in a conventional manner and with conventionally-sized starting materials (e.g., powders). Nano-particles of other materials may also possess unique electrical and/or magnetic properties, thereby opening the door to the fabrication of materials having previously unforeseen properties and attributes. The extremely large surface area to weight ratio of nano-particles allows nano-particles to interact with their surroundings very quickly which can also lead to the fabrication of new materials having new properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In sum, it is recognized that the ability to produce any material in nano-particle form represents a unique opportunity to design and develop a wide range of new and useful mechanical, optical, electrical, and chemical applications, just to name a few. However, one problem that heretofore has limited the use of nano-particles is the difficulty in producing nano-particles of the desired size and composition on a commercial scale, e.g., by the kilogram instead of by the gram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One method for producing nano-particles involves dissolving in a solvent precursor chemicals which define the composition of the final nano-particle product. The resulting composition is mixed to yield a solution which is substantially homogenous on a molecular level. The solvent is then evaporated at a sufficient rate so that the components in the homogenized solution are precipitated as a homogenized solid powder. While such wet processes have been used to produce nano-particles of various compositions, they are not without their problems. For example, such processes tend to produce larger particles along with the nano-particles, which must then be removed or separated from the nano-particles before the nano-particles can be used. Such wet processes can also involve a significant number of process steps and reagents which tend to increase the overall cost of the final nano-particle product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another method for producing nano-particles is a primarily mechanical process in which the precursor material is ground in a mill (e.g., a ball mill) until particles of the desired size are produced. Unfortunately, however, such grinding processes are energy intensive, require substantial amounts of time, and typically result in the production of a powder containing not only the desired nano-particle product, but also particles having larger sizes as well. Of course, such larger sized particles must be separated from the nanoparticles before they can be used. The abrasive materials used in such milling and grinding processes also tend to contaminate the nano-particle material. Consequently, such grinding processes generally are not conducive to the production of a highly pure nano-particle product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several other processes have been developed in which the precursor material is vaporized, typically in a partial vacuum, and then rapidly cooled in order to initiate nucleation and precipitate the nano-particle material. For example, in one process, a stream of vaporized precursor material is directed onto the surface of a cold (i.e., refrigerated) rotating cylinder. The vapor condenses on the cold surface of the cylinder. A scraper placed in contact with the rotating cylinder scrapes off the condensed material, which is then collected as the nano-particle product. In another process, the vapor stream of precursor material is condensed by expanding the vapor stream in a sonic nozzle. That is, the vapor stream is initially accelerated in the converging portion of the nozzle, ultimately reaching sonic velocity in the throat of the nozzle. The vapor stream is then further accelerated to a supersonic velocity in the diverging section of the nozzle. The supersonic expansion of the vapor stream rapidly cools the vapor stream which results in the precipitation of nano-sized particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing vaporization and cooling processes have been used to produce nano-particle materials, they are not without their problems. For example, the rotating cold cylinder process has proved difficult to implement on a large scale basis and has been less than successful in producing large quantities of nano-particle material. While the sonic nozzle process is theoretically capable of producing large quantities of nano-particles on a continuous basis, it requires the maintenance of a proper pressure differential across the sonic nozzle throughout the process. Another problem with the sonic nozzle process is that the nano-particle material tends to condense on the nozzle walls, which can seriously reduce the efficiency of the nozzle, and may even prevent it from functioning. While the condensation problem can be reduced by injecting a boundary layer stream along the nozzle walls, such a provision adds to the overall complexity and operational cost of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a need remains for a method and apparatus for producing nano-particles that does not suffer from the shortcomings of the prior art methods. Such a method and apparatus should be capable of producing large quantities of nano-particle product, preferably on a continuous basis, and at a low cost. Ideally, such a method and apparatus should be less sensitive to certain process parameters than other systems, thereby allowing the method and apparatus to be more easily practiced on a large scale (i.e., commercial) basis. Additional advantages could be realized if the method and apparatus produced nano-particles in a relatively narrow size range, with a minimum amount of larger sized particles and/or contaminant materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for producing nano-particles of a precursor material is shown and described herein as it may be used to produce nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of molybdenum oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) from a precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used to produce nano-particles of other vaporizable or sublimable materials, as will be described in greater detail below. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for producing nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may comprise a sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having at least one vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> associated therewith. A precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having an inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends into the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is exposed to vaporized (e.g., sublimated) material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> contained within the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a product collection apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which collects the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and defines an isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> within which is provided a quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to a supply of a quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such as liquid nitrogen. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The quench fluid is discharged from the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As will be described in greater detail below, the fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> rapidly cools the vaporized material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> flowing through the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This rapid cooling results in the precipitation of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The precipitated nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> continues to be carried along the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the product collection apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The product collection apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may comprise a filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a pump assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that is fluidically connected to the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The pump assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> draws or pumps the vaporized material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, into the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and ultimately through the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the vaporized material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is converted within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a carrier stream having the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> suspended therein. The carrier stream containing the suspended nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> continues to be drawn through the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> under the action of pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, ultimately reaching the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> removes the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the carrier stream. The carrier stream is then discharged into the surrounding atmosphere as filtered carrier stream <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for producing nano-particles may be operated as follows to produce nano-particles of molybdic oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). As a first step in the process, a suitable MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as MoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, is fed into the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is sublimed (i.e., converted directly to a vapor or gas state from a solid state without passing through a liquid state) within the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, resulting in the production of a sublimed or vapor state material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The sublimed or vapor state material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is generally contained within the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Depending on the composition of the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the sublimed (i.e., vaporized) material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be combined with a suitable oxygen-containing carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (e.g, air) in order to fully oxidize the sublimed material. The carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be allowed to enter the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a suitable opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provided therein. Such additional oxidation may be required or desired if the precursor material comprises &ldquo;sub-oxide&rdquo; material (e.g, MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and where the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is to be MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Once the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the product collection apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is activated, it draws the sublimed or vaporized material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> contained within the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sublimed material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> first enters the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) which isolates the sublimed material from the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As the sublimated material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> continues to flow through the conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the sublimed material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> contacts and mixes with the quench fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> emerging from the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> rapidly cools or quenches the sublimated material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (i.e., substantially adiabatically) which causes the precipitation of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The precipitated nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is generally suspended within a carrier stream (which may comprise air and/or other gaseous components remaining in the vapor stream <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> after the precipitation of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, the carrier stream containing the precipitated nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> continues to be carried along the conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereupon it is ultimately collected by the filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the product collection apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be harvested from time to time to remove the accumulated nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>produced according to the method and apparatus of the present invention may be imaged in accordance with any of a wide range of microscopy processes that are now known in the art or that may be developed in the future that are suitable for imaging particles in the nano-size range. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an image of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produced by a transmission electron microscope in a process generically referred to as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As is readily seen in the TEM image illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each individual particle of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a generally cylindrically shaped, rod-like configuration having a mean length that is greater than the mean diameter. While the size of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be expressed in terms of the mean length or the mean diameter of the particles (e.g., as imaged by transmission electron microscopy), it is generally more useful to express the size of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in terms of surface area per unit weight. Measurements of particle surface area per unit weight may be obtained by BET analysis. As is well-known, BET analysis involves an extension of the Langmiur isotherm equation using multi-molecular layer absorption developed by Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller. BET analysis is an established analytical technique that provides highly accurate and definitive results. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the method and apparatus of the present invention has produced nanoparticle material having sizes in the range of about 4-44 square meters/gram (m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g) (15-35 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g preferred) as measured in accordance with BET analysis. Alternatively, other types of measuring processes may be used to determine the particle size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A significant advantage of the present invention is that it can be used to produce nano-particles of MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in very large quantities and at a very low cost. The present invention is also relatively simple to construct, easy to operate, and is not overly sensitive to certain process parameters. Consequently, the present invention is ideally suited for use in large-scale (i.e., commercial) applications. The nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produced by the present invention also contains particles within a fairly narrowly defined size range and with a minimum amount of larger-sized particles. Consequently, the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produced in accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention may be generally regarded as a high quality product that requires little or no additional processing before it may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it is generally immune to problems associated with the condensation of the nano-particle material on the internal components of the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Consequently it is not necessary to take additional measures (e.g., the injection of an insulating boundary layer) to discourage the accumulation of nano-particle material on the internal components of the system. Moreover, even if the nano-particle product eventually accumulates on the internal components of the system, the simple design of the system will allow any such accumulation to be easily removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Still yet other advantages are associated with the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. For example, the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be readily fabricated from commonly available tubing and does not require the provision of any converging/diverging sections. The placement of the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> within the inner pipe member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> further simplifies construction of the nano-particle apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Having briefly described the method and apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention, as well as some of their more significant features and advantages, the various embodiments of the method and apparatus for producing nano-particles of the present invention will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring back now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one embodiment of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for producing nano-particles is shown and described herein as it may be used to produce nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of molybdenum tri-oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Alternatively, however, the present invention could also be used to produce nano-particles of other vaporizable or sublimable materials, as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> associated therewith. The sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is suitable for receiving a supply of the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be delivered to the furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in either a continuous manner or in batches. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fed into the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on a continuous basis by a screw-type conveyor system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, of course, other precursor materials, vaporizing devices and/or product delivery schedules may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown and described herein, the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises an electrically heated furnace having one or more electric heating elements <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provided therein for elevating the temperature in the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a level sufficient to sublimate the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As is commonly understood, the terms &ldquo;sublimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;sublimation&rdquo; refer to processes wherein a material is transformed directly from the solid state to the gas or vapor state without passing through the liquid state. Sublimation of the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows for the production of a highly pure MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As an aside, it should be noted that while sublimation furnaces are currently used to produce highly purified MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>powder (conventionally referred to as sublimed molybdic oxide), the particles comprising the resulting powder produced by currently used sublimation processes are considerably larger than the nano-sized particles produced with the method and apparatus of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Continuing now with the description, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to use with sublimation furnaces, but could instead utilize any of a wide range of other furnaces that are now known in the art or that may be developed in the future that are or would be suitable for vaporizing or sublimating the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Examples of other types of furnaces that could be utilized with the present invention include, but are not limited to, muffle furnaces, induction furnaces, vacuum furnaces, plasma arc furnaces, tube furnaces, and arc furnaces. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is shown and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As will be discussed in greater detail below, the furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be provided with one or more openings or inlets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> therein to allow a carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to enter the sublimation region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Depending on the application, the carrier gas could comprise an oxidizing gas, a reducing gas, or an inert gas. Stated another way, the inlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the particular carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is allowed therein allows the vaporization or sublimation process to occur within a controlled gas atmosphere. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is air, so the inlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be open to the surrounding atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned within the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is contained generally within the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defined by the furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be connected to a collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is then connected to the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be connected directly to the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may comprise a generally elongate, pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that defines the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The elongate, pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be supported along at least a portion of its length by a generally elongate, pipe-like outer member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, pipe-like outer member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is generally concentrically aligned with pipe-like inner member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and is separated a spaced distance therefrom so that an insulating space or annulus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is defined between the inner and outer pipe-like members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The insulating annulus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is advantageous in that it helps to keep the inner pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> cool, thereby discouraging the re-vaporization of the precipitated nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> flowing through the inner pipe <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer pipe-like members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from any of a wide variety of materials (e.g., high-temperature alloys and stainless steels) suitable for the intended application. By way of example, in one preferred embodiment, the inner pipe member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is fabricated from a high-temperature alloy (e.g., Hastelloy&reg; &ldquo;C&rdquo;) since the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of inner pipe <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is exposed to the high temperatures in the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The outer pipe-like member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fabricated from type SAE <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> stainless steel, although it could also be fabricated from other types of steel alloys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer pipe-like members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may have dimensions that are commensurate with the size (i.e., desired production capacity) of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for producing nano-particles. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the inner pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has an inside diameter of about 41.3 mm and a wall thickness of about 6.4 mm. The outer pipe-like member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may have an inside diameter of about 54 mm and a wall thickness of about 6 mm. Accordingly, the insulating space or annulus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will have a thickness of about 7 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As was briefly described above, the inner, pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided with a quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is suitable for discharging the quench fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the inner, pipe-like member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may comprise an elongate tube-like member or quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having an inlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a J-shaped outlet end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The inlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to the supply of quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, preferably via an accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> ensures that the quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (e.g., a cryogenic gas) supplied to the inlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> remains in the liquid state. The J-shaped outlet end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> defines the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is positioned within the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is directed toward the outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the quench fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> discharged by the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is directed generally toward the outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The location of the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has some influence on the sizes of the nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produced by the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. For example, moving the location of the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> closer to the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally results in larger nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being produced. Conversely, moving the location of the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> away from the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generally results in smaller nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, other factors can also affect the particle size. For example, smaller nano-particles can be produced even when the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned closer to the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of fluid conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by increasing the flow rate of the product collection device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. That is, higher flow rates (e.g., in liters/minute) will result in a higher velocity flow within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Of course, the velocity within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be changed by varying the inside diameter of the inner pipe <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be positioned within the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. If so, the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is regarded as part of the precipitation conduit. However, we have found that it is generally preferable to position the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the manner shown and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Since the sizes of the nano-particles produced by the apparatus of the present invention are related to several structural and operational parameters of the invention, as described herein, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to any particular parameters or range of parameters for any given structural or operational configuration. For example, in the embodiment shown and described herein, the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned within the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located about 16.5 cm from the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This position, combined with the other parameters specified herein, will result in the formation of a nano-particle product substantially as described herein. However, depending on the flow rate provided by the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, good results have also been obtained by positioning the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the range of about 150-360 mm from the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, it is also possible to position the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and such a positioning may be advantageous depending on the particular nano-particle product that is to be produced as well as on certain other process parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be made from any of a wide range of materials (e.g., stainless steels) that would be suitable for the intended application. By way of example, the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> utilized in one embodiment of the invention is fabricated from type SAE <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> stainless steel. The size (i.e., inside diameter) of the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the size (i.e., overall production capacity) of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has an inside diameter of about 4 mm. Alternatively, of course, other tube sizes may be used, as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in one embodiment of the invention is provided by means of the J-shaped outlet end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, other configurations are possible. For example, in another embodiment, the inner pipe <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided with an integral flow channel therein that terminates in a discharge arm having a fluid outlet therein. The discharge arm may be generally radially oriented within the isolation chamber defined by the inner pipe and the fluid outlet may be positioned so that it is generally aligned with the central axis of the inner pipe. Such an arrangement allows the quench fluid to be discharged at about the center of the inner pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is generally preferred, but not required, to position a temperature sensor, such as a thermocouple (not shown) within the interior region of the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a location downstream of the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (i.e., between the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The output signal (not shown) from the thermocouple (also not shown) may then be monitored to maintain the temperature of the carrier stream and suspended nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within a desired temperature range that is appropriate for the particular nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being produced. By way of example, in one preferred embodiment, the thermocouple is positioned about 240 mm downstream of the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the thermocouple may be located at other positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and serves as a convenient means for directing the nano-particles toward the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while allowing the supply of quenching fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be directed into the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. More specifically, in the embodiment shown and described herein the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> defines an interior chamber <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having an outlet end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that is connected to the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The outlet end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the inner pipe <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> terminates within the interior chamber <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exiting the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is conveyed to the outlet end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The outer support pipe <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be secured to the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (e.g., by welding) to allow the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to be supported by the outer support pipe <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may pass through the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> where it is ultimately connected to the accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from any of a wide range of materials suitable for the intended application, as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention. By way of example, in one preferred embodiment, the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fabricated from type SAE <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> stainless steel, although other mild steel alloys, ceramics, or other suitable materials may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and may comprise a blower or pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The blower or pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> draws the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. More precisely, the vaporized material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is converted within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a carrier stream having the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> suspended therein. The carrier stream containing the suspended nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> continues lo be drawn through the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> under the action of pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, ultimately reaching the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> removes the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the carrier stream. The carrier stream is then discharged into the surrounding atmosphere as filtered carrier stream <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be harvested from time to time to remove the captured nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The blower or pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> utilized in the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may comprise any of a wide range of air pump devices that are well-known in the art and readily commercially available. By way of example, in one preferred embodiment, the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises a centrifugal blower having a capacity of about 2800 (e.g., 2831) liters per minute. Alternatively, the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may have either a larger or smaller capacity depending on the intended production capacity of the nano-particle production apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be provided with a variable capacity to allow the user to vary the flow rate of the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to more easily effect certain changes in the sizes of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may comprise any of a wide range devices suitable for removing small particles from an air stream. By way of example, in the embodiment shown and described herein, the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a particulate filter medium fabricated from Gore-Tex&reg;. The filter material should be sufficiently fine so that it will capture substantially all of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exiting the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. However, since filters for capturing such nano-sized particles are well-known in the art and could be easily provided by persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention, the filter utilized in one preferred embodiment of the present invention will not be described in further detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In an alternative arrangement, the filter assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may comprise a liquid scrubber-type filter wherein the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is collected by bubbling the carrier stream and nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through a liquid (e.g., alcohol), although other liquids may be used. The liquid captures the nano-particle material which may thereafter be removed from the liquid by conventional techniques. Still other filtering devices and processes are possible and could be used to capture and remove the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the carrier stream, as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention. Consequently, the present invention should not be regarded as limited to the particular product collection apparatus shown and described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The supply of quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise a supply of a fluid suitable for effecting the rapid (i.e., substantially adiabatic) cooling of the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Toward this end, it is generally preferable that the supply of quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprise a supply of a cryogenic fluid. As used herein, the term &ldquo;cryogenic fluid&rdquo; refers to a liquids that boil at temperatures of less than about 110 K (&minus;163.15&deg; C.) at atmospheric pressure. Cryogenic fluids include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, argon air, and methane. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the supply of quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises a supply of liquid nitrogen. In order to provide optimal quenching performance, it is generally preferable to place an accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between the supply of quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the inlet <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> helps to ensure that the quench fluid enters the tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as a liquid, as opposed to a liquid/gas mixture. Alternatively, a liquid/gas mixture can be used if increased flow-rates are desired and the end temperature is maintained within the appropriate range. Accordingly, the quench fluid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may enter the quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as either a pure liquid, a pure gas, or a mixture thereof so long as the temperature sensed by the thermocouple (not shown) positioned within the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is maintained at the appropriate temperature for the particular nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may comprise any of a wide range of accumulators that are well-known in the art and that are readily commercially available. Consequently, the accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that may be utilized in one preferred embodiment of the invention will not be described in greater detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be operated in accordance with the following method in order to produce nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The nano-particles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are produced from a precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that may comprise any of a wide range of molybdenum compounds and oxides that are convertible into MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the precursor material may comprise a socalled &ldquo;technical grade&rdquo; molybdic oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) powder having a typical size of about 200 U.S. Tyler mesh and preferably less than about 100 U.S. Tyler mesh. The technical grade molybdic oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be produced in accordance with any of a variety of processes that are well-known in the art, such as roasting processes and so-called &ldquo;wet&rdquo; processes. For example, the MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be produced according to the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,151, entitled &ldquo;Process for Autoclaving Molybdenum Disulfide&rdquo; issued Sep. 8, 1998, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all that it discloses. Alternatively, the MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be produced according to the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,844, entitled &ldquo;Method for the Production of a Purified MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>Composition,&rdquo; issued Oct. 13, 1998, which is also incorporated herein by reference for all that it discloses. Technical grade MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>powder is also readily commercially available from the Climax Molybdenum Company of Ft. Madison, Iowa, 52627 (USA), which is a subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Other precursor materials are available and could also be used in conjunction with the present invention, as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art after having become familiar with the teachings of the present invention. For example, in another embodiment, the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be comprised entirely of molybdenum &ldquo;sub-oxides&rdquo; (e.g., MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), or some combination of molybdenum &ldquo;sub-oxides&rdquo; and MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. If so, the amount of molybdenum sub-oxides may be subsequently oxidized by providing an oxidizing atmosphere in the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The oxidizing atmosphere will oxidize any sub-oxides contained in the precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> before the same is drawn into the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Additional oxygen for the oxidization process may be obtained from the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (e.g., air) that is allowed to enter the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via the carrier gas inlet <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a separate supply of an oxygen-containing gas may be provided to the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to provide the oxidizing atmosphere required to fully oxidize any sub-oxide compounds that may be present. Of course, the carrier gas could comprise other materials depending on the particular process. For example, the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> could also comprise a reducing gas or an inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the particular precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is utilized (e.g., either MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be fed into the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in either a continuous manner or in batches. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fed into the furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a continuous manner by a screw-type conveyer system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Once the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is delivered to the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the sublimation furnace <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> heats the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a temperature in the range of about 800&deg;-1300&deg; C. (with optimum results being obtained within a temperature range of about 1093&deg;-1260&deg; C.), which is sufficient to sublime the MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, resulting in the production of a vaporized or sublimed precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, sublimation is a process wherein the precursor material transitions to a gaseous or vapor state directly from a solid state without passing through a liquid state. Sublimation of the precursor material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows the production of a highly purified nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The sublimed or vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be combined with a carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, such as air or any other desired atmosphere, to assist in the flow of the vaporized or sublimed precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may serve as a source of additional oxygen to oxidize any sub-oxides that may be contained in the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may comprise an inert gas or may be supportive of reduction reactions if required or desired. The vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (along with the carrier gas <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) is drawn into the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the action of pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Upon being drawn into the inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> enters the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Isolation chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> isolates the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the vapor region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> continues to travel down the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it eventually contacts the quench fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being discharged by the quench fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided on the J-shaped outlet end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The quench fluid stream <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being discharged by the fluid port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is considerably cooler than the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This results in the rapid (i.e., substantially adiabatic) cooling of the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The rapid cooling results in the precipitation of the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The resulting mixture of precipitate (in the form of the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and carrier stream (e.g., air or inert or other gas atmosphere) continues to be carried down the precipitation conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereupon it is discharged into the collection manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is ultimately captured by the filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the product collection system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The remaining carrier stream passes through the pump <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is discharged into the surrounding atmosphere as filtered carrier stream <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, any of a wide range of liquified gases, preferably cryogenic gases, may be used as the quench fluid to effect the rapid cooling of the vaporized precursor material <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown and described herein, liquid nitrogen is used as the quench fluid and is provided to the inlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of quench fluid tube <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at a pressure in the range of about 1.3-8.3 bar (5.1-7.6 bar preferred). The accumulator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> ensures that the quench fluid (e.g., nitrogen) enters the inlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as a liquid, as opposed to a liquid/gas mix or in a gaseous form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an image of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produced by a transmission electron microscope in a process that is commonly referred to as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As is readily seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each individual particle of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a generally cylindrically shaped, rod-like configuration having a mean length that is greater than its mean diameter. While the size of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be expressed in terms of the mean length or the mean diameter of the particles (e.g., as detected by transmission electron microscopy), it is generally more useful to express the size of the nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in terms of surface area per unit weight due to the correlation between size and surface area. Measurements of particle surface area per unit weight may be obtained by BET analysis which is, as mentioned above, an established analytical technique that provides highly accurate and definitive results. In the embodiment shown and described herein, the method and apparatus of the present invention has been used to produce a nano-particle material having a size in the range of about 4-44 square meters/gram (m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g) (15-35 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g preferred) as measured in accordance with the BET analysis technique. Alternatively, other types of measuring processes may be used to determine the particle size. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this Example, the precursor material comprised a &ldquo;technical grade&rdquo; molybdic oxide (MoO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) powder having a typical size of about 24-260 microns. Such technical grade molybdic oxide powder is produced by the Climax Molybdenum Company of Fort Madison, Iowa, and is readily commercially available therefrom. The precursor material was provided to an electrically heated sublimation furnace of the type described above having a capacity to sublimate or vaporize approximately 284 kg/hr of precursor material. In this Example, the capacity of the sublimation furnace is considerably greater than was required to produce the amount of nano-particle material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described in this Example. This is because the sublimation furnace is used in a conventional manner to produce a highly purified sublimed MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>material in accordance with a conventional process. The conventionally produced sublimed MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>material comprises particles that are much larger than the nano-sized particles produced according to the present invention. Therefore, most of the sublimed or vaporized MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>produced by the furnace was used in the conventional process, with only a small portion being drawn-off through the precipitation conduit to produce the nano-particle material in accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A precipitation conduit having the configuration and dimensions of the precipitation conduit described above was mounted within the vapor region contained within the sublimation furnace. The precipitation conduit was connected to a collection manifold which was connected to a product collection apparatus. The inlet end of the quench fluid tube was connected to a supply of quench fluid (e.g., liquid nitrogen) in accordance with the description provided herein. The technical grade MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material was fed into the sublimation furnace in a continuous manner by a screw type conveyer system. Once within the furnace, the MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material was heated to a temperature of about 1100&deg; C. which was sufficient to sublime the MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>precursor material. The pump associated with the product collection apparatus was then turned on. As mentioned above, the pump has a capacity of about 2831 liters/minute. Liquid nitrogen was utilized as the quenching fluid and was introduced into the inlet end of the quench fluid tube at a pressure of about 1.3 bar. An accumulator was used to ensure that the nitrogen entered the quench fluid tube as a liquid. Once the nitrogen flow was initiated, the apparatus started to produce the nano-particle material, which was thereafter captured by the filter assembly associated with the product collection apparatus. The flow-rate of the liquid nitrogen quench fluid was such that the temperature of the carrier stream containing the nano-particle product <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as measured by the thermocouple positioned within the precipitation conduit was maintained in the range of about 37-54&deg; C. The apparatus was operated in this manner for a time period of about 120 minutes, which resulted in the production of about 2.26 kg of nano-particle material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is readily apparent that the apparatus and process discussed herein may be used to produce large quantities of MoO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>nano-particle material with much simpler apparatus and without being overly sensitive to certain process control parameters. Consequently, the claimed invention represents an important development in nano-particle technology in general and to molybdenum nano-particle technology in particular. Having herein set forth preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is anticipated that suitable modifications can be made thereto which will nonetheless remain within the scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended that the appended claims be construed to include alternative embodiments of the invention except insofar as limited by the prior art. </paragraph>
