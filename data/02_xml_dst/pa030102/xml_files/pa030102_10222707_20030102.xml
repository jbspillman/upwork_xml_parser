<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus, accurate velocity feedback control is implemented by correcting any error in a VCM velocity detection value, which is caused by a temperature change or the like. At the start of loading control for loading a head from a ramp onto a disk, a carriage is pushed against an outer-periphery stopper to set the actual velocity of a VCM to zero. In this state, a VCM velocity detection value detected by a VCM velocity detection circuit is read out. On the basis of this velocity detection value, calibration for correcting the relationship between the VCM current value and the VCM velocity detection value is performed. In the period of head positioning control after the loading, an operation using a timer is periodically performed in which the carriage is pushed against an inner-periphery stopper, the calibration is reexecuted, and the head is returned to the original head position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus and, more particularly, to a calibration method suited to automatic adjustment of the velocity detection value used in unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, some disk apparatuses for recording and reproducing information by using a head, e.g., some small magnetic disk apparatuses use a head retraction method called a loading/unloading method. The characteristic feature of this loading/unloading method is as follows. When no data read/write operation is performed, e.g., when the rotation of a disk (recording media) is stopped, a head stops on a ramp mechanism positioned outside the outer periphery of the disk. In this state, the head is moved from a retraction position on the ramp mechanism onto the disk by an instruction from a host to thereby perform a read/write operation. When the read/write operation is complete, the head is returned from the disk onto the ramp mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The operation of moving the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk is called loading, and the operation of moving the head from the disk onto the ramp mechanism is called unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-63920 has disclosed an apparatus for loading and unloading an arm having a head slider to and from a rotary information recording disk by driving the arm by an actuator. In this apparatus, the back electromotive force of a voice coil type driving mechanism of the actuator is detected and fed back to a driving control circuit, and this control circuit controls the position and velocity of the actuator. That is, this reference describes that when loading or unloading is performed, velocity feedback control is performed by detecting the VCM velocity by using the back electromotive force generated in the voice coil motor (VCM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this prior art, however, which performs velocity feedback control by detecting the VCM velocity by using the back electromotive force generated in the voice coil motor (VCM), if the resistance of the coil of the VCM changes due to temperature change or the like, the relationship between the value (VCM current value) of current flowing through the VCM and the VCM velocity detection value also changes. This makes accurate velocity feedback control impossible to perform. The above reference does not describe the nature of the problem and a method of solving the problem when the resistance of the coil of the VCM changes due to temperature change or the like and the relationship between the VCM current value and the VCM velocity detection value changes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a calibration method capable of accurately correcting the relationship between the value of a voice coil motor current flowing through a voice coil motor and a voice coil motor detection value detected by a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, thereby performing accurate feedback control during loading/unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a calibration method capable of improving the accuracy of a detected velocity by detecting a state in which the VCM resistance changes due to temperature change or the like and this may change the relationship between the VCM current value and the VCM velocity detection value, thereby performing more accurate velocity feedback control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; and periodically reexecuting the calibration after the head is loaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit is accurately corrected by the calibration. The calibration is executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor. With this the calibration, the velocity detection value detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit can be accurately corrected by velocity feedback control during unloading. This makes accurate unloading possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Generally, when a predetermined time or more has elapsed from loading, the resistance of the VCM coil changes due to temperature change, and this causes an error in the aforementioned relationship corrected by the calibration. So, (velocity feedback control during) unloading may not be accurately performed. In the present invention, however, the calibration is periodically reexecuted after loading. Accordingly, unloading can be accurately performed regardless of the reception timing of an unload instruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; and if it is detected that a change in a temperature of the voice coil motor or an ambient temperature thereof from a temperature during loading is not less than a prescribed value after the head is loaded, reexecuting the calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the VCM coil resistance changes due to temperature change, the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading cannot reflect the present state any longer, and the error increases. This may make accurate unloading impossible. In the present invention, however, if the change in the VCM temperature from that during loading is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, the calibration is reexecuted. Consequently, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; reading out the voice coil motor velocity detection value immediately after loading control is switched to on-track control from the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit and storing the readout value in a memory; and monitoring the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit while the head is positioned on the disk and, if an absolute value of a difference between the monitored voice coil motor velocity detection value and the voice coil motor velocity detection value stored in the memory is not less than a prescribed value, reexecuting the calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> If the absolute value of the difference between the VCM velocity detection value detected immediately after loading control is switched to on-track control and the VCM velocity detection value monitored while the head is positioned on the disk (in the head positioning control state), i.e., the VCM velocity detection value difference is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, it is highly likely that the VCM coil resistance has changed. If this is the case, the error in the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading increases, so unloading may not be accurately performed. In the present invention, however, if the VCM velocity detection value difference is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, the calibration is reexecuted. Consequently, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The calibration can also be reexecuted by moving the carriage to the inner-periphery stopper position. If this is the case, the carriage is pushed against the inner-periphery stopper to realize zero VCM velocity, so the calibration can be done with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to reexecute the calibration by moving the carriage to the outer-periphery stopper position by unloading and to reload after the calibration. If this is the case, the carriage is pushed against the outer-periphery stopper to realize zero VCM velocity, so the calibration can be done with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; and if a predetermined time has elapsed since the head is loaded when an unload instruction is received, reexecuting the calibration and performing unloading thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As already described above, when a predetermined time or more has elapsed from loading, the VCM coil resistance changes due to temperature change, and this increases an error in the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading. So, unloading may not be accurately performed. In the present invention, however, the elapsed time from loading is checked when an unload instruction is received. If a predetermined time or more has elapsed, the calibration is reexecuted, and then unloading is performed. Therefore, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; and if a change in a temperature of the voice coil motor or an ambient temperature thereof from the temperature during loading is not less than a prescribed value when an unload instruction is received, reexecuting the calibration and performing unloading thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As already described above, if the VCM coil resistance changes due to temperature change, the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading cannot reflect the present state any longer, and the error increases. This may make accurate unloading impossible to perform. In the present invention, however, if the change in the VCM temperature from that during loading is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, the calibration is reexecuted, and then unloading is performed. Therefore, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; reading out the voice coil motor velocity detection value immediately after loading control is switched to on-track control from the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit and storing the readout value in a memory; and monitoring the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit when an unload instruction is received and, if an absolute value of a difference between the monitored voice coil motor velocity detection value and the voice coil motor velocity detection value stored in the memory is not less than a prescribed value, reexecuting the calibration and performing unloading thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As already described above, if the difference between the VCM velocity detection values is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, it is highly likely that the VCM coil resistance has changed. So, the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading can no longer reflect the present state, and the error increases. This may make accurate unloading impossible. In the present invention, however, if the difference between the VCM velocity detection values is equal to or larger than a prescribed value, the calibration is reexecuted, and then unloading is performed. Therefore, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The reexecution of the calibration when the unload instruction is received can also be performed by moving the carriage to the inner-periphery stopper position. If this is the case, the carriage is pushed against the inner-periphery stopper to realize zero VCM velocity, so the calibration can be done with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a calibration method for use in a head loading/unloading type disk apparatus having a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk, a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor, and a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head, comprising the steps of: executing, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, the calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor; when an unload instruction is received, performing unloading by using a result of the calibration during loading; and if the unloading indicates abnormality, moving the carriage to an inner-periphery stopper position, reexecute the calibration, and again performing unloading by using a result of the reexecuted calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When unloading control is performed in accordance with an unload instruction, unloading may not be accurately performed depending on the error in the aforementioned relationship corrected during loading. Unloading abnormality occurs if the VCM current value during unloading control does not reach a current value by which the head can be unloaded to the ramp mechanism. If this is the case, it is highly likely that the head is not present on the ramp mechanism. In the present invention, therefore, if unloading abnormality occurs, the carriage is moved to the inner-periphery stopper position and pushed against the inner-periphery stopper. In this state, the calibration is reexecuted, and unloading is again performed by using this updated velocity correction value. This makes accurate unloading feasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the entire arrangement of a magnetic disk apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> denotes a disk (magnetic disk) as a data recording medium; and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, heads (magnetic heads) used to write (record) data to the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and read (reproduce) data from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. These heads <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> face the two surfaces of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the magnetic disk apparatus has one disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. However, a plurality of disks can also be stacked in the magnetic disk apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A large number of concentric tracks are formed on each surface of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A plurality of servo areas recording servo data for positioning control and the like are formed at equal intervals on each track. On the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, these servo areas are radially arranged over the tracks from the center. Data areas (user areas) are formed between the servo areas. A plurality of data sectors are set in each data area. The servo data contains a cylinder code indicating the cylinder number of a cylinder in which the servo area exists, and burst data indicating a positional error in the cylinder indicated by the cylinder code by the amplitude of waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is attached to a carriage (head <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, moving mechanism) <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as a rotary actuator. The head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> moves in the direction of radius of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in accordance with the rotational angle of the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. By this seek operation, the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> lands on a target track. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> ramp (ramp mechanism) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for laying the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> retracted when the rotation of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is stopped is arranged outside the outer periphery of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. This ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is located in a predetermined position, close to the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, on the moving path of an end portion (tab) of a suspension <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>attached to the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. An inclined portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is formed on an end portion (close to the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) of the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to facilitate retraction of the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In the course of unloading for moving the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the end portion (tab) of the suspension <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> slides upward on the inclined portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is lifted from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, slides on the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and stops in a predetermined position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> spindle motor (to be referred to as an SPM hereinafter) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> rotates the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at high velocity. A voice coil motor (to be referred to as a VCM hereinafter) <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> drives the carriages <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The SPM <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is driven by a control current (SPM current) supplied from an SPM driver (SPM driving circuit) <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is driven by a control current (VCM current) supplied from a VCM driver (VCM driving circuit) <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. A VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> detects (a voltage representing) the driving velocity (VCM velocity) of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is determined by the back electromotive force (VCM back electromotive force) generated in the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> when the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is driven. The detected value of this VCM velocity indicates the moving velocity of the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a driver IC <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as a one-chip integrated circuit implements the SPM driver <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> (to be described later) determines values (control amounts) for determining the control currents to be supplied from the SPM driver <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. and the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to the SPM <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After landing on a target track of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by seek operation, the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> scans the track by the rotation of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. By scanning, the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> sequentially reads out servo data from servo areas equally spaced on the track. Also, the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reads or writes data with respect to a target data sector by scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to a head amplifier circuit (head IC) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> mounted on a flexible printed circuit board (FPC). This head amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> controls input and output of read/write signals with respect to the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The head amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> amplifies an analog signal (a read signal of the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) read out by the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Also, the head amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> performs predetermined signal processing for write data supplied from a read/write circuit (read/write IC) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and supplies the processed signal to the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The read/write circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) function, decoding function (read channel), encoding function (write channel), and servo extracting function. The AGC function amplifies the analog signal (the read signal of the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), which is read out from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and amplified by the head amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, to a constant voltage. The decoding function performs signal processing necessary to reconstruct, e.g., NRZ code data from the read signal amplified by the AGC function. The encoding function performs signal processing necessary to record data on the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The servo extracting function extracts servo data from the read signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The CPU (Central Processing Unit) <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> contains a ROM (Read Only Memory) storing control programs and controls the individual components of the magnetic disk apparatus in accordance with the control programs. In addition to the ROM, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> contains a memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> constructed of, e.g., a RAM (Random Access Memory), a timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, A/D (analog-to-digital) converters <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and an I/O (Input/Output) interface <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. The A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>converts the burst data (burst signal) in the servo data extracted by the read/write circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into digital data. The A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>converts the VCM velocity detection value detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the temperature measurement value (VCM temperature) of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is measured by a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (to be described later), into digital data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> calculates head position on the basis of the cylinder code in the servo data extracted by the read/write circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the burst data in the servo data extracted by the read/write circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and input via the A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines a control amount for moving (seeking and positioning) the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a target position on a target track in units of servo areas. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> supplies this control amount to the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via the I/O interface <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to perform head positioning control by which the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is positioned in the target position by seek operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the course of loading for moving the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> onto the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and unloading for retracting the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> onto the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> calculates a loading/unloading velocity control amount on the basis of the VCM velocity detection value detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and converted into digital data by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> supplies this control amount to the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via the I/O interface <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to perform (loading/unloading control by) velocity feedback control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A hard disk controller (HDC) <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> performs protocol processing for communicating commands and data with a host apparatus (host system), read/write control for the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the read/write circuit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and control for transfer of read/write data with respect to the host apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The temperature sensor <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> measures the temperature of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or the temperature (VCM temperature) in the periphery (vicinity) of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is connected to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and has a well-known circuit configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, i</cross-reference>.e., includes operational amplifiers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and resistors <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The resistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is a sense resistor and has resistance Rs.

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> detects the VCM velocity detection value (G*BEF) determined by the back electromotive force BEF and the velocity reduction coefficient G. This velocity reduction coefficient G is the circuit gain of the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and set at a value necessary to calculate the VCM velocity detection value from the back electromotive force BEF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> (The VCM velocity detection value corresponding to) the detection value of the back electromotive force with respect to the VCM current value at 0 velocity is supposed to be 0. However, a circuit error produces a difference between detection values of the back electromotive force with respect to the VCM current value (Ivcm) at zero (0) VCM velocity. This in large part because the VCM resistance Rvcm changes with temperature to produce a difference between the value (actual Rvcm) on the left side of equation (6) and the value (temporarily calculated Rvcm) of the right side of equation (6). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the VCM current value (Ivcm) and the detection value of the VCM velocity corresponding to the back electromotive force at zero VCM velocity for two temperatures A and B (A&gt;B). Since <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a conceptual view, the VCM velocity detection value is 0 when Ivcm&equals;0. However, this VCM velocity detection value is not generally 0 when Ivcm&equals;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The VCM velocity corresponding to the back electromotive force at zero VCM velocity can be detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by fixing the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in position and changing the VCM current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Generally, a magnetic disk apparatus using a head loading/unloading system includes an inner-periphery stopper (not shown) for fixing the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> does not depart from the innermost periphery of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and an outer-periphery stopper (not shown) for fixing the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> does not move outward past the predetermined position on the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> when the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is unloaded on the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by changing the VCM current while the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is pushed against the inner- or outer-periphery stopper, the VCM velocity (VCM velocity detection value) corresponding to the back electromotive force at zero VCM velocity can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Even when the current Ivcm flows through the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> while the carriage position is fixed, the back electromotive force BEF is supposed to be 0 (V) because the velocity is zero. However, the difference between Rvcm (&equals;Rs*R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/Rl) temporarily calculated by equation (6) and actual Rvcm produces a difference between the values of the left and right sides of equation (7). This difference produces a detection error in the VCM velocity value of equation (8) detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when Ivcm flows through the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> at zero velocity. Hence, the VCM velocity detection value must be corrected. Velocity feedback control can be accurately performed by correcting the VCM velocity detection value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can calculate the correction value (VCM velocity correction value) of the VCM velocity detection value as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> First, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> drives the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> via the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to unload the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and push the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the outer-periphery stopper. In this state, i.e., in a state where the velocity of the VCM <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is zero, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> allows the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to detect the VCM velocity corresponding to the back electromotive force BEF of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> executes this operation by using a plurality of different values of the VCM current (Ivcm) supplied from the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A pair of DC offset voltage (VEL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) and slope k is called a VCM velocity correction value (calibration value). Also, the operation of calculating this VCM velocity correction value, i.e., the operation of calculating the VCM velocity correction value including the DC offset voltage (VEL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) and the slope k by supplying the VCM current having several (in this embodiment, two) different values to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> while the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is pushed against the inner- or outer-periphery stopper, i.e., while the velocity is zero, is called calibration (velocity correction value calibration). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To control loading/unloading of the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> need only perform velocity feedback control by correcting the VCM velocity detection value as follows by using the VCM velocity correction value (VEL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>,k) obtained by the above calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> First, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out the present VCM velocity detection value VEL from the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via the A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> subtracts the DC offset voltage VEL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> in the VCM velocity correction value from the VCM velocity detection value VEL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> calculates a corrected present VCM velocity detection value VEL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> thereby calculating a differential velocity VEL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines a control amount such that this differential velocity VEL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a target velocity. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> outputs this control amount to the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via the I/O interface <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to cause the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to supply a VCM current (control current) corresponding to the control amount to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This allows accurate velocity feedback in loading/unloading control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> If, however, the resistance (VCM resistance) of the coil of the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> changes due to temperature change or the like and this changes the relationship between the VCM current value and the VCM velocity detection value, the VCM velocity correction value described above becomes meaningless. In this embodiment, therefore, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> detects any VCM resistance change due to temperature change or the like, which may change the relationship between the VCM current and the VCM velocity detection value. If such change is detected, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reexecutes the aforementioned calibration to update the velocity correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The first to fourth calibration methods applicable to this embodiment will be described in order below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (1-1) First Calibration Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The first calibration method will be described with reference to flow charts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> receives a load instruction from the host apparatus and initializes and activates the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to start loading (following the load instruction from the host apparatus) by which the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved from the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> onto the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in accordance with the instruction (step A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Next, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> controls the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to push the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the outer-periphery stopper. In this state, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> causes the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to supply to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> a VCM current having, e.g., two current values A and B in a direction in which the driving force to the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> acts toward the outer periphery, thereby performing the calibration described above at zero velocity in this outer-periphery stopper position (step A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out VCM velocity detection values SS and LL corresponding to the VCM current values A and B, respectively, from the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> calculates the VCM velocity correction value including k given by equation (9) and the DC offset voltage VEL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> given by equation (10), and stores this VCM velocity correction value in a predetermined location of the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> then performs loading control (step A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out the VCM velocity detection value from the VCM velocity correction circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and moves the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by performing velocity feedback while correcting the readout VCM velocity detection value on the basis of the present VCM velocity correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In head position control (i.e., normal control) in which the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is positioned in a target position on the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, if the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> detects a ready state (step B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out and checks for the value (timer value) of the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (step B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> If the timer value is smaller than a predetermined prescribed time, i.e., if the elapsed time from the previous (latest) calibration (in this method, the calibration during loading) has not reached the prescribed time, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that the temperature difference from the temperature in the previous calibration is small. So, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> immediately returns to head positioning control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If the timer value is equal to or larger than the prescribed time, i.e., if the elapsed time from the previous calibration is equal to or larger than the prescribed time, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that it is better to update the present VCM velocity correction value because the change in the VCM temperature from that in the previous calibration (in this method, the calibration during loading) may be large. If this is the case, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> drives the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to retract the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward, e.g., the inner periphery of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and pushes the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the inner-periphery stopper (step B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In this state, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> causes the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to supply to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> a VCM current having, e.g., two current values A and B in a direction in which the driving force to the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> acts toward the inner periphery. In this way, the CUP <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs calibration at zero velocity in the inner-periphery stopper position and updates the present VCM velocity correction value stored in the predetermined location of the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (step B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> initializes and reactivates the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (step B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), performs seeking to move the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the original head position (step B<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), and returns to the normal head positioning control state. If the value of the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is equal to or larger than the prescribed time in this state, the flow advances to the processing from step B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs new calibration to update the VCM velocity correction value and reactivates the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the first calibration method as described above, if the prescribed time has elapsed from the previous calibration, new calibration is performed to update the VCM velocity correction value. That is, after loading the calibration is periodically performed to update the VCM velocity correction value. Therefore, even if the temperature difference may increase from the previous VCM temperature with the passage of time, the latest VCM velocity correction value reflecting the VCM temperature at that point can be used in unloading control. Accordingly, accurate unloading can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the above explanation, the timer check starts when the ready state is detected in the head positioning control period. However, the timer check can also be preferentially performed when command processing is necessary, i.e., in a busy state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (1-2) First Modification of First Calibration Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The first modification of the first calibration method will be described below with reference to a flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This first modification is characterized in that the calibration for updating the VCM velocity correction value after loading is performed in the outer-periphery stopper position, not in the inner-periphery stopper position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The process of loading is similar to that in the first calibration method and performed in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The following processing is performed in the period of head positioning control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> If the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> detects the ready state in the head positioning control state (step C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out and checks for the value of the timer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (step C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If the timer value is smaller than the prescribed time, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that the temperature difference from the temperature in the previous calibration is small, and immediately returns to head positioning control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> If the timer value is equal to or larger than the prescribed time, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that it is better to update the present VCM velocity correction value because the temperature difference from the temperature in the previous calibration (in this modification, the calibration during loading) may be large. If this is the case, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs unloading control by driving the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to move the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and pushes the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the outer-periphery stopper (stopper C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In this unloading control, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> uses the latest VCM velocity correction value calculated in the previous calibration (the prescribed time ago). So, accurate unloading can be expected. However, if the VCM velocity correction value is not updated by the following calibration, an error of this correction value may increase with the passage of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, while the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is unloaded and the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is pushed against the outer-periphery stopper, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> causes the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to supply to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> a VCM current having, e.g., two current values A and B in a direction in which the driving force to the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> acts toward the outer periphery.

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The second modification of the third calibration method will be described below with reference to a flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. This second modification is characterized in that the VCM velocity detection value check is performed in unloading control requiring the VCM velocity correction value, and the calibration for updating the VCM velocity correction value is performed in accordance with the check result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The process of loading is similar to that in the third calibration method and performed in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>. Also, the operation in the period of head positioning control is similar to the conventional operation. That is, neither VCM velocity detection value check nor calibration based on the check result is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> To start unloading (in accordance with an unloading instruction from the host apparatus) by which the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved from the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> onto the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> reads out the VCM velocity detection value detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via the A/D converter <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and looks up the VCM velocity detection value during loading stored in the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (steps L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> calculates the difference V between the two velocity detection values and compares the absolute value of this velocity difference with the predetermined prescribed value (step L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> If (the absolute value of) the present VCM velocity detection value and the VCM velocity detection value during loading is smaller than the prescribed value, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that the detection error in the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is small, and immediately executes unloading control (step L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). In this unloading control, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> uses the VCM velocity correction value calculated in the calibration during loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> If (the absolute value of) the present VCM velocity detection value and the VCM velocity detection value during loading is equal to or larger than the prescribed value, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that it is better to update the present VCM velocity correction value because the detection error in the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is large. If this is the case, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> drives the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to retract the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward, e.g., the inner periphery of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and pushes the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the inner-periphery stopper. In this state, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> causes the VCM driver <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to supply to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> a VCM current having, e.g., two current values A and B in a direction in which the driving force to the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> acts toward the inner periphery. In this way, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs calibration at zero velocity in the inner-periphery stopper position and updates the present VCM velocity correction value stored in the predetermined location of the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the latest value (step L<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> then executes unloading control by using this updated VCM velocity correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> (4) Fourth Calibration Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The fourth calibration method will be described below with reference to a flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. This fourth calibration method is characterized in that the normality/abnormality of unloading is checked during unloading control, calibration for updating the VCM velocity correction value is performed on the basis of the check result, and unloading control is again performed by using the updated VCM velocity correction value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The process of loading is similar to that in the first calibration method and performed in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> When receiving an unload instruction from the host apparatus, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> looks up the VCM velocity correction value during loading stored in the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (step M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and executes unloading control by which the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved onto the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (step M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> In this unloading control, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, velocity feedback control is performed such that the target velocity is fixed. If the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> accurately detects the VCM velocity, the VCM velocity detection value is 0 when the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> abuts against the outer-periphery stopper. In velocity feedback control, on the other hand, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> so moves the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as to obtain the target velocity and hence supplies a control current (VCM current) having a maximum current value to the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the control current has substantially the maximum current value if the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has reached the outer-periphery stopper position during unloading control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> If, however, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines that the detection error of the VCM velocity detection value in the VCM velocity detection circuit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is large and the difference from the target velocity is small, a control current having a small current value may be supplied as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B, i</cross-reference>.e., an enough control current to move the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the head stop position on the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may not be supplied. If this is the case, unloading abnormality may occur in which (the end portion of the suspension <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for supporting) the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> stops on the inclined portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the ramp <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> instead of sliding upward along the inclined portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In this fourth calibration method, therefore, at the timing at which unloading control is presumably complete in normal state, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> checks whether the control current for the VCM <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines in velocity feedback control, has reached a predetermined reference current value, thereby checking the normality/abnormality of unloading (step M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The timing of this check is determined by adding a certain margin on the basis of the distribution of time necessary for unloading control, which is experimentally obtained. Also, the reference current value is determined from the maximum current value described above. In this embodiment, the reference current value is 80% of the maximum current value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> If the control current (VCM current) has a reference current value or more at the timing of the above check and the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines in step M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the unloading is normal, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> immediately completes the unloading control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> If the control current (VCM current) is smaller than the reference current value at the timing of the check and the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> determines in step M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that the unloading is abnormal, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> retracts the head <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> toward the inner periphery of the disk <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and pushes the carriage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> against the inner-periphery stopper (step M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). In this state, the CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> performs calibration in the inner-periphery stopper position and updates the VCM velocity correction value stored in the predetermined position of the memory <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the latest value (step M<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). The CPU <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> then reexecutes the unloading control by using the updated VCM velocity correction value (step M<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> In the above description, the present invention is applied to a magnetic disk apparatus. However, the present invention is similarly applicable to any other disk apparatus, such as a magnetooptical disk apparatus, than a magnetic disk apparatus, which uses a head loading/unloading system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Also, the various calibration methods described above can also be selectively combined where necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In the present invention as has been described in detail above, the velocity correction value for correcting any error of the VCM velocity detection value resulting from temperature change or the like is acquired on the basis of the VCM velocity detection value detected by the VCM velocity detection circuit while the actual velocity of the VCM is zero. This improves the accuracy of this velocity correction value and the detection accuracy of the VCM velocity. Consequently, accurate velocity feedback control can be performed during loading/unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the present invention a VCM resistance change due to temperature change or the like, which may change the relationship between the VCM current value and the VCM velocity detection value is detected. If such change is detected, the velocity correction value is again acquired by reexecuting the calibration while the actual velocity of the VCM is zero. Since this further improves the detection accuracy of the VCM velocity, more accurate velocity feedback control can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<claim id="CLM-00019">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A head loading/unloading type disk apparatus comprising: 
<claim-text>a voice coil motor for driving a carriage to move a head in a direction of radius of a disk; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a voice coil motor velocity detection circuit for detecting a voice coil motor velocity corresponding to a back electromotive force of the voice coil motor; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a ramp mechanism arranged outside an outer periphery of the disk to retract the head; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a memory; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>a controller for, at the start of loading control for loading the head from the ramp mechanism onto the disk, executing calibration for correcting a relationship between a value of a voice coil motor current flowing through the voice coil motor and the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit, said calibration being executed by obtaining a voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit in a state where an actual velocity of the voice coil motor is set to zero and a current is supplied to the voice coil motor, and, immediately after switching from loading control to on-track control, reading out the voice coil motor velocity detection value from the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit and storing the readout value into said memory, monitoring the voice coil motor velocity detection value detected by the voice coil motor velocity detection circuit while the head is positioned on the disk, and reexecuting said calibration if an absolute value of a difference between the monitored voice coil motor velocity detection value and the voice coil motor velocity detection value stored in said memory is not less than a prescribed value.</claim-text>
