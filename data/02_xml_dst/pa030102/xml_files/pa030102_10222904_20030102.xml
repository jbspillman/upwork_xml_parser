<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of The Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a fixing device using the induction heating, which is used for fixing an image, such as a toner image, on a fixed material, such as a paper, in an image forming system, such as an electrophotography system, an electrostatic process copying machine or a laser printer, and a method for producing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, there is known the following fixing device for an electrophotography system. That is, a halogen lamp or the like is used as a heat source. This is provided inside of a heating roller of a metal to heat the heating roller. A pressure roller having an elastic material at least on the surface thereof is provided so as to face the heating roller while pressingly contacting the heating roller. A paper serving as a fixed material is caused to pass through a nip portion formed between the two rollers contacting each other. During the passing, a toner image on the paper is melted and fixed. There is also known a fixing device wherein a flash lamp is used for heating a paper without contacting the paper to fix a toner image. Moreover, as fixing devices having improved efficiency, there are known a fixing device having magnetic field producing means combined with a belt as shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-76620, and a fixing device using a heating member of a ceramics as shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-33476. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, there are various problems in the above described conventional fixing devices. That is, in the fixing device utilizing the induction heating based on an induction coil, it is actually very difficult to uniformly heat the heating roller. In order to optimize the heating efficiency to realize the uniform heating, it is required to optimize the construction of the induction coil itself, but this is actually remarkably difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> With respect to the uniform heating of the heating roller, it is also required to prevent the non-uniformity of temperature of the heating roller in axial directions (cross directions) thereof. The conventional device using the halogen lamp heater is designed to cope with it by changing the light distribution characteristics. Also in the induction heating fixing devices, it is required to take measures to obtain the same effects. That is, it is required to take measures to cause heating distribution to be uniform. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the accompanying drawings, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view of the whole construction of a fixing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for fixing a toner image serving as an image on a fixed material (a paper) in an electrostatic process copying machine or the like. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a principal part (a heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) of the fixing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a paper P. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the positions of the two rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The fixing device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is designed to melt and fix a toner on the paper P serving as a fixed material by causing the paper P, which is arranged on the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to pass through a portion (nip portion) between the upper high-temperature heating roller (fixing roller) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower pressure roller (press roller) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which pressingly contact each other, from the right to the left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supported on a bearing B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) rotatably with respect to a body (chassis) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and rotated clockwise by a driving motor (not shown). The heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed of an endless member, e.g., a cylindrical member of &Oslash;40 mm. For example, the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be formed by winding a heat resistant belt between two pulleys to house therein an induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, as long as it is formed of an endless member. The pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted on the body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to pressingly contact the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the rotatably supported pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be biased by springs S against the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to pressingly contact the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> pressingly contacts the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be held so as to form a nip portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a predetermined width. The pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> itself has no driving mechanism, and is driven counterclockwise by the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a double structure, the inside structure of which comprises a body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of iron having a thickness of, e.g., 1 mm. In place of iron, stainless, aluminum, a composite material of stainless and aluminum, or the like may be used. The outside surface of the body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is coated with a mold releasing layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of teflon or the like. In addition, the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> pressingly contacting the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a double structure comprising a core <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an outside coating layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of an elastic material, such as silicon rubber or fluoro rubber, for coating the core <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the internal cavity of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the induction heating device (magnetic field generating means) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided so as to be fixed to the body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. By the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the iron body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is heated. By the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thus heated, the developer (toner) on the paper P is melted and fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Around the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, various devices are provided. That is, slightly downstream of the contact position (nip portion) <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in rotation directions, a peeling claw <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for peeling the paper P from the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided. Downstream of the peeling claw <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in rotational directions, a thermistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for detecting the temperature of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided. Downstream of the thermistor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a cleaning member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for removing refuse, such as offset toner and waste papers, is provided. Downstream of the cleaning member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, i.e., upstream of the nip portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, at which fixing is carried out, a mold releasing agent applying device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for applying a mold releasing agent for preventing the offset of the toner is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be described in detail. The device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a core (coil supporting member) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a heat resistant resin, such as a high heat resistant industrial plastic, and an exciting coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The exciting coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> allows alternating current to effectively pass through a litz wire. For example, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed of a bundle of 19 unit wires, each of which is coated with a heat resistant polyamideimide and each of which has a diameter of 0.5 mm. As described above, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is magnetically a so-called air-core coil which does not have a magnetic core, such as a ferrite or iron core, since the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is supported on the non-magnetic core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, since it is not required to use any iron cores having a complicated shape, it is possible to reduce the costs, so that it is possible to provide an inexpensive magnetic circuit. Furthermore, in the figure, reference numbers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote coil temperature sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A high-frequency current is supplied from an exciting circuit (not shown), such as an inverter circuit, to the exciting coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to generate an eddy current in the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the variation in magnetic field. By this eddy current, the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> produces Joule heat by its electrical resistance to be heated. For example, it is possible to cause a high-frequency current having a frequency of 25 kHz and 900 W to pass through the exciting coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be described in detail below. The induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be embodied in various ways, and each of examples thereof will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The relationship between the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the coils <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the above described induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be-described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) through <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) show cross sections of different examples. In these figures, a distance D denotes a required clearance serving as a minimum distance, by which going coils <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), . . . and returning coils <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), (B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), which are associated with the going coils to form one turn, can approach to each other. That is, if the going coils are too close to the returning coils, the magnetic fields formed by the respective coils are canceled out. Therefore, in order to avoid this, the going coils and returning coils of one turn must be spaced from each other by a predetermined distance. This predetermined distance is expressed by D in the figure. Therefore, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) through <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) show examples of duplex, triplex, quadruplex windings of coils <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In either example, the distances between the going coils and returning coils of one turn are greater than the distance D. Specifically, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), in each one turn, the going coil (F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and returning coil (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the going coil (F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and returning coil (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and the going coil (F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and returning coil (B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) are spaced from each other by a greater distance than the distance D. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) showing the triplex and quadruplex windings, the first layer and second and third layers are embedded in grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) formed in the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, so that the outer diameter of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the finally wound outermost layer is constant. In these figures, when the coils <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are wound as a multiplex winding, there is adopted a so-called straw bag stacking wherein the upper layer coil is offset from the lower layer coils so that the upper layer coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is received by a groove formed by adjacent two of the lower layer coils. Thus, when the outside coil is wound by a greater tension than that of the inside coil, the upper and lower layer coils are closely stacked up, the shape of the outermost periphery approaches an appropriate circle, so that the gap between the outside surfaces of the coils and the inside surface of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (the metal body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) covering the coils is more uniform. Thus, the temperature for heating the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is uniform and appropriate. Furthermore, in the cores in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) through <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; denotes a core body, onto which the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is first wound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows an example of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the axial directions thereof. Thus, in the vicinity of both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is bent in the shape of U at a tension applied by winding, so that it is not possible to prevent the shape of the cross section of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from changing from a complete round shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) to an ellipse or flat oval shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). That is, if the coil expressed by <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is cut along a cutting plane line C-C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the cross section of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), not <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Therefore, if the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not devised, the diameter of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> plus coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the end portion of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is greater than the diameter in the central portion thereof. In order to avoid this, small diameter neck portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A) are provided on both ends in this preferred embodiment as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). That is, the diameters of the end winding portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A) are smaller. Thus, after the winding of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is completed, the difference between the outside diameter of the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the inside diameter of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., the gap therebetween, can be uniform in the central portion of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in longitudinal directions and in both end portions thereof. That is, it is possible to prevent the outside surface of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from approaching the inside surface of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on both ends in axial directions, so that it is possible to prevent the gap from decreasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a way of winding the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this winding way, first two turns are wound between grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B) and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B), which are formed in both end portions so as to face each other in axial directions, in view of the facility in winding. However, in such winding, the distance between the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of both ends is greater than that in the central portion. Therefore, as the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the heating distribution in both end portions is different from that in the central portion, so that the temperature for heating the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is uneven in axial directions. That is, the heat generation in both end portions is smaller than that in the central portion. Because the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> enters the grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B) in both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be greatly spaced from the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as can be seen from the foregoing. On the other hand, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, first two turns are wound onto the outside portions (neck portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A)) of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> similar to turns in the central portion without being wound between grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B) and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(B) in both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the turns are wound onto the outer peripheries of the narrow neck portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A) formed in both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this case, two turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are embedded in grooves formed in the neck portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A) so as not to protrude from the outer peripheries of the neck portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A), <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(A). Thus, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has the same plane as the neck portions in the vicinity of the both end portions, and contributes to heat generation in this state. Thus, the heat generation in the both end portions is equal to the heat generation in the central portion. Thereafter, the turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, while the first two turns are wound onto the upper surface sides of both of the neck portions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one turn may be wound onto the upper side and the other turn may be wound onto the lower side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show another example of a core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a cross section in the vicinity of both ends of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows a cross section in the central portion of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this example, grooves <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) for housing therein the first two turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are deeper in the central portion in axial directions, and shallower in the vicinity of both ends. Thus, the heating roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is uniformly heated by the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in both of the central portion and both end portions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the state of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an end portion wherein the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown by a two-dot chain line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this end portion, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is bent in the form of a so-called U-turn. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the end of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to have two radii R, R of curvature. Thus, the traveling length of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> increases in both end portions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that it is possible to ensure sufficient heat generation even in both end portions, in which the heating value tends to decrease. Specifically, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, assuming that the radius of curvature of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is R and the distance between turns of the innermost periphery is D, R&lt;D/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set. Such a winding way may be carried out in at least one end portions of the core. In addition, one or more turns may be wound by such a winding way. Moreover, while the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has two radii of curvature when it is wound in the shape of U, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be wound so as to have at least one radius R of curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show another example of a way of winding the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and are partially perspective and plan views. In this example, in order to sufficiently heat both end portions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the winding direction of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is perpendicular to the axis to increase the length of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in this portion to sufficiently heat the end portions. That is, as can be seen from FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> travels on the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the axis thereof, bent at the end portion in a direction perpendicular to the axis, bent perpendicularly again to travel along the axis, and travels along the axis of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> again in the reverse direction. When the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound as a single layer, at least two turns may have the wound portions perpendicular to the axis as described above. When the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound as a multiplex winding, two turns or more of at least the outermost layer of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be wound by the above described winding way. In this case, it is required to prevent the variation in gap between the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> serving as an object to be heated. Such a winding way may be carried out in at least one end portion of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition, when the above described winding way is carried out in one end portion of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at least one of the two curvature portions may be bent by about 90&deg; to increase the length of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> traveling in this end portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is substantially the same as the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), except that the inside three of the turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are roundly wound, and only the outside two turns are angularly wound as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an example characterized by a way of winding the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> That is, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a single layer winding of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this case, the turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are wound in order of number in this figure. That is, the first through sixth turns of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are first wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> downwards from the top, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> travels to the lowermost side, and then, the seventh through twelfth turns are wound upwards from the bottom. According to such a winding way, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a series of operations. Thus, it is not required to separately form and combine the first through sixth turns of the coil and the seventh through twelfth turns of the coil. Also when the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound so as to form three layers or more, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be wounded by a series of operations according to the same winding way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an example of a duplex winding. Also in this case, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be wound by a series of operations by winding the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in order of number as shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an example of a layout of the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is arranged outside of the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is arranged below the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to pressingly contact the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a weak heating portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>wherein the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not exist, and a strong heating portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>wherein the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is densely wound. If the time for the strong heating portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to face the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is long, the deterioration of the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is promoted. That is, the weak heating portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is caused to face the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is, the weak heating portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to face the nip portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) show examples of the insulation for the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. That is, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has two end portions of a leading end portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and a trailing end portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows an example where the two end portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are attached to each other in parallel, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows an example where the end portions are twisted. In general, since a high frequency current is supplied to the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is not possible to avoid the generation of noises. However, since currents pass through the leading end portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and trailing end portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in reverse directions to each other, electromagnetic influences are canceled out to inhibit the generation of noises by attaching the two end portions to each other. The examples shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) provide this effect. By attaching the two end portions to each other as shown in these figures, the generation of noises is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> According to the above described preferred embodiments of the present invention, the following effects can be obtained as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> (1) Since the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is long, there are some cases where the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can not be wound by one layer. In this case, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound by a plurality of layers, and it is considered that the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound by three layers to prevent all of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from being wound by two layers. The third layer is embedded in a deep groove formed in the core. In this case, by preventing the going and returning portions of one turn of the coil from being too close to each other, it is possible to inhibit the magnetic fields from being canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> (2) The coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along the axis thereof. At this time, the coil is intended to be crushed to increase its height in the vicinity of both ends so as to increase in radial directions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, since the neck portions are formed in both end portions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the diameter of the wound coil from increasing to form a uniform gap between the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inside surface of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (3) In the winding of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the gap between the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> tends to increase in both end portions of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the distance between the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inside surface of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is set so as not to increase in both end portions, so that it is also possible to appropriately heat the both end portions of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (4) When the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> partially as a duplex winding, that portion greatly contributes to the generation of heat. In order to avoid this, the lower layer coil of the two layers of the coil portions is embedded in the groove formed in the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent only the duplex winding portion from more greatly generating heat than the other single winding portion. Thus, it is possible to prevent the nonuniformity of heat generation distribution of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to optimize the temperature distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (5) When the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is bent in both end portions so as to have a bend radius as a U-turn along the axial directions (longitudinal directions). Therefore, it is possible to increase the area (length) wherein the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> faces the heating roller at the bent portion, so that it is possible to optimize the heat generation distribution of the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (6) When the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, each of the both end portions have a portion, at which the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to be bent around the axis of the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to heat the heating roller <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the temperature distribution is appropriate in longitudinal directions. </paragraph>

Therefore, even if the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is wound so as to have a complicated shape, the winding can be carried out by a series of operations, so that it is possible to improve the working efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (8) When the induction heating device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> wound onto the core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed to the body <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the central portion, in which the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is closely wound, does not face the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (nip portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), so that it is possible to prevent the pressure roller <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from being excessively heated by turning the power supply ON. Thus, it is possible to inhibit the surface state, such as gloss, of a fixed paper from being greatly changed by turning the power supply ON for the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> (9) The input and output portions of the outgoing line of the coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are attached to each other, so that the electromagnetic field effects can be canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the heating roller can be appropriately heated by the induction heating coil so that its temperature distribution is uniform from both ends to the central portion, and the winding of the coil onto the core can be easily carried out by a series of operations. Moreover, it is possible to inhibit noises from being generated in the outgoing line portion. </paragraph>
