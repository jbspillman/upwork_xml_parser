<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a carry bag with a pouch insert, magnetic fasteners, and interchangeable covers, particularly a carry bag with a tiered cover and a removable, closable, free-standing pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the diversification of the roles of women over the past few decades, fashion has changed to meet the needs of the career woman who is also a mother and homemaker. In times past, women would change their purses to match their outfits and the occasion. Women today for the most part are not inclined to sacrifice the extra time it takes to transfer the contents of their purses several times a day in order to coordinate their purse to their outfit or the occasion. Also, handbags today can be expensive, and having a handbag for each outfit or occasion is prohibitively expensive for the majority of women. It is nevertheless often still necessary to switch purses, as when converting from casual clothes or office gear to evening wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One handbag-related problem recognized many years ago is the soiling of handbag exteriors. Purse inserts with buttonholes to match buttons in exterior coverings were created so that the exterior covering could be removed, laundered, and replaced. It was later found that this allowed the user to switch between similar but different colored exterior coverings. Problems related to changing purses to go with one&apos;s outfit or shoes include the time it takes to switch the purse contents, and inadvertently leaving behind items in the old purse. Quite a few things tend to accumulate in purses, particularly the purses of mothers of babies or toddlers, and purse changing can be an undesirable, time-consuming ordeal. Various solutions have not entirely solved these problems. Continuing problems include loss of items from open-mouth purses or purse inserts, increasing complexity of purses with interior pockets and flaps, inefficient means for fastening a cover to a foundation bag, and undesirable bulkiness or heaviness of the resulting handbag. The present invention solves these and other problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a carry bag with a pouch insert and magnetic fasteners. The pouch is preferably inserted into one of many different types of bag covers. The carry bag of the present invention comprises: a) a three dimensional, generally rectangular-shaped, closable pouch that comprises six exterior faces: front and back, two ends, bottom, and top; b) a closure means in the top face of the pouch, preferably a zipper or drawstring closure; c) at least two magnetic fasteners; and d) a detachable carrying strap. One portion of each magnetic fastener is secured to each end face, or the front and back faces, of the pouch, and an opposite portion of each magnetic fastener is secured to the carrying strap. The portions of the magnetic fasteners on the carrying strap correspond to the magnetic portions on the pouch, so that a user can quickly and easily attach the carrying strap to the pouch, and then detach it from the pouch. Alternatively, the carry bag comprises the pouch and one or more interchangeable covers. The cover comprises an open, three dimensional, generally rectangular-shaped, cover compartment with four sides and a bottom. The cover compartment is of sufficient size to snugly accommodate the pouch. Each compartment comprises a magnetic fastener portion that corresponds to an opposite magnetic fastener portion on the pouch, so that the pouch without the detachable carrying strap can be quickly and easily inserted into, or detached from, the cover.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the following description, like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views. Also, in the following description, it is to be understood that such terms as &ldquo;front,&rdquo; &ldquo;back,&rdquo; &ldquo;top,&rdquo; &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo; &ldquo;end,&rdquo; and the like are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms. Referring in more detail to the drawings, the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention comprises an inner pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an exterior cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Carry bags herein can be carried by a person and used to store personal items. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a three dimensional, generally rectangular-shaped, closable pouch having six faces: front and back, two ends, bottom, and top. The front and back faces are two substantially parallel, opposite, principal walls, and the two ends of the pouch are substantially parallel and opposite to each other. Each of the two end faces of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> comprises a male (or female) magnetic snap fastener portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The magnetic snap portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is preferably secured to the exterior of the pouch in the approximate center of the upper extremity of the end face. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is substantially comprised of a flexible, sturdy material. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably substantially free-standing and made of a material which does not collapse when, for example, the pouch is set upright on a surface or propped against a chair leg or other post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present invention comprises an open, three dimensional, generally rectangular-shaped cover compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The cover compartment is of sufficient size to snugly accommodate the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The cover compartment includes a front, a back, a bottom, and two compartment ends which are opposite and generally parallel to each other. Each compartment end comprises a magnetic snap fastener portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that corresponds to an opposite magnetic snap fastener portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without a detachable carrying strap can be quickly and easily inserted into, or detached from, the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are secured to the upper extremities of the interior faces of the ends of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, roughly in the center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The corresponding portions of the magnetic snap fasteners <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attract each other because of an internal magnet; they do not require force in order to secure the male portion to the female portion of the magnetic snap fastener. Because it is easy to secure the magnetic fasteners, the pouch can be quickly attached to, and even more easily removed from, the cover. &ldquo;Changing purses&rdquo; is thus quick and easy when the present invention is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably two magnetic snap fasteners are sufficient and therefore preferred for use herein. Various suitable types of magnetic snap fasteners are commercially available. A suitable magnetic snap fastener for use herein includes a female portion with first and second plates, and a male portion with third and fourth plates. A magnetic member is attached to one of the plates of the female portion. Rivets may be used to hold the plates of each portion together. Each plate may include a central portion which protrudes into an opening defined by the magnetic portion. The snap may have a cylindrical or other form. Another suitable magnetic fastener includes a permanent magnet with ferromagnetic plates attached to either side. For use, the permanent magnet and one plate may be attached to a body, with the other plate member being attached to a cover, so that it serves as a fastener in an opening and closing portion of a handbag or the like. A third suitable type of magnetic snap fastener includes a tubular or partially sealed hollow stem with a central opening. The stem fits into a hole in a magnet to connect each of two portions of the fastener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> fits securely into the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on its top face. The top face of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be slightly curved to make the zipper <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> more accessible to the user and easier to pull, and to add structure to the pouch. The zipper <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> allows the user to access a central storage area in the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The top face may curve with a greater arc than is shown, and the ends of the zipper may extend down into the end faces of the inner pouch. In that case, the magnetic fasteners could be placed lower, or off-center and to the left or right of the zipper ends. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and/or the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include interior and/or exterior pockets for organization of items in the bag. The pouch preferably comprises one or two interior zippered pockets, but preferably no exterior pockets. The cover may also comprise a means for opening and closing the carry bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an optional exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be sewn along the top edge of the back face of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises a female (or male) exterior magnetic snap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which corresponds to a male (or female) magnetic snap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the front face of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The male magnetic snap <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably secured in the approximate center of the front face of the cover so that the female magnetic snap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> contacts it when the exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is lowered over the front of the cover. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, opposite ends of a carry strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are attached to the ends of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The inner pouch can very quickly and easily be inserted in the cover by simply dropping it into the corresponding space or compartment in the cover. Part of the versatility of the present invention lies in the fact that the inner pouch is designed to fit in a wide variety of covers. In general, the covers vary more widely than do the pouches. A wide variety of coverings, such as beach bags, tote bags, luggage, knapsacks, lunch boxes, fanny packs (waist packs), bags which circle or strap onto the wrist (wrist bags), bags for attachment to a belt (belt bags), camera bags, bags for carrying telephones (phone bag), briefcases, cosmetic bags, organizers, and many different types of handbags and shoulder bags, can be designed to fit the same or different inner pouches. The user can, for example, insert the inner pouch into a handbag or briefcase cover in the morning, then remove the pouch from the handbag or briefcase cover in the afternoon and drop it into a diaper bag cover to pick up her baby from day care. Later, she can remove the pouch from the diaper bag cover and insert it into an evening bag cover for a night out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A user&apos;s individual needs and tastes will be met by covers for larger or smaller pouches, which all fall within the scope of this invention. Pouches can be made in several different shapes. Examples of various pouch embodiments are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Each type of pouch could fit interchangeably into the various covers illustrated, as well as into other embodiments. For deep (wide) covers such as tote bags, the magnetic fasteners may be positioned lower in the carry bag so that the pouch rests on the bottom or floor of the carry bag. In long carry bags such as briefcases, one of the magnetic fastener portions on the cover may be placed on a divider wall. The divider wall may extend across the whole width of the interior of the cover, or it may leave more room inside the carry bag by extending for only part of the carry bag&apos;s width. In most handbag embodiments, the cover compartment will occupy the majority of the space in the interior of the handbag cover. In larger carry bags such as knapsacks or diaper bags, the cover compartment for the pouch may be attached inside or outside the front or back wall of the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the carry bag of the present invention may comprise only a pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a detachable (removable) carrying strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The detachable carrying strap, either: 1) has two opposite ends (preferred) with a corresponding portion of each magnetic fastener secured to each end of the carrying strap; or 2) is a circular strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with corresponding portions of each magnetic fastener secured on the inside of the strap opposite to each other, a bottom section of the circular strap being available to support the pouch, and an opposite, top section of the circular strap being free for carrying on a user&apos;s shoulder or hand. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the detachable carrying strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> secured to its opposite ends. These correspond to the magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the ends of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows an alternate embodiment of the pouch with carrying strap, with the corresponding magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the front face, and indicated on the back face of the pouch. The carrying strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferably for smaller, lightweight inner pouches intended to carry fewer items. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the present invention is preferably of a flexible material of sufficient texture, color, and decoration to function as a purse by itself. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not a rigid shell, but it is preferably made of a sturdy material so that it maintains its structure even when it is filled with sundry personal articles. The detachable carry strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be quickly removed if, for example, the user wishes to change to a more structured handbag by inserting the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into a handbag cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Another advantage of the detachable carry strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is that the strap can be rotated down and out of the way of the zipper or drawstring opening in the top of the pouch when the handbag is not being carried even without detaching the carry strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be small enough to hold just a few items, such as a lipstick, keys, and eyeglasses, or large enough to tote many items. Pouch sizes may range, for example, from about 4 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, which would be adaptable to fit a wrist or belt pocketbook, to about 15 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 6 inches thick. A pouch of sufficient size to fit a standard-sized handbag cover is about 9&frac12;&times;7&frac12;&times;2&frac12; inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The top face of the inner pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> holds a hidden zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with a zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The zipper closure of the inner pouch may be metal, nylon, plastic, or any other suitable material, and may be straight, curved, flat, hidden or &ldquo;invisible.&rdquo; The zipper preferably extends across the middle (lengthwise) of the top face of the inner pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> fits into a like-sized, open cover compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a briefcase or satchel-like cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The cover compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by broken lines. The cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also has a storage compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is adjacent to the cover compartment for the pouch, for holding other objects. The cover compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises an interior partition <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which divides the cover compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the pouch compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and another compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and two pouch compartment ends, which are opposite and generally parallel to each other, the interior partition <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprising one of the pouch compartment ends. One of the magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is secured on an inside end of the briefcase cover, and the other magnetic snap fastener portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is secured to an attached tab, or to a divider wall as illustrated with broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It does not matter whether the magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside the compartment are male or female, so long as their corresponding magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the pouch are the opposite (i.e., their mates). The divider wall separates the interior of the cover into compartments. Other than the divider wall, the other sides of the cover compartment are formed by the walls and bottom of the cover. A compartment sewn on or otherwise attached to the inside front wall of the cover and also having the magnetic fastener portions can be used as an alternative method of securing the pouch inside the cover. A sturdy carrying strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the ends of the briefcase cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Other types of carrying straps may be employed. One end of the cover has an outer storage pocket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for holding, for example, a cell phone, planner, palm-top computer, or calculator. Taps <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be secured to the four comers of the bottom of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to reduce scuffing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an inner pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is insertable into a pouch compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Interior partition <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> forms an end of pouch compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The front of the carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> holds an exterior pocket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which can also function as a pouch compartment to receive a pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has two adjacent exterior pockets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrates a carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an interior partition <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and two carrying straps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Covers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for use herein may be made of leather, straw, nylon, or any suitable plastic or fabric. They may be made of fabric layered over a backing for stiffness. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably fits snugly into the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can have its own exterior closure such as an exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. With closures on both the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the contents of the bag are less likely to spill out when the bag is tipped over. Although the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is secured to the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with magnetic fasteners or the like, hook and loop fasteners (also called flexible tape strips) may be employed elsewhere in or on the bag. Hook and loop fasteners, though, are not preferred for fixing the inner pouch to the cover because hook and loop has a tendency to catch hair and other particles that commonly accumulate in purses. Over time, the hook and loop fastener strips often become so dirty that corresponding strips will not fasten to each other. Magnetic fasteners do not have this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The opposite ends of the pouch and the cover preferably are made of a material which is relatively straight and does not buckle so that the magnetic fastener portions easily contact each other. This facilitates quick insertion of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Also included in the present invention is a kit with which a user can put together two or more different carry bags for different outfits or occasions. The kit comprises a pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a detachable carrying strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and one or more covers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of different colors and/or materials. The carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a handbag, shoulder bag, briefcase, tote bag, diaper bag, evening bag, beach bag, piece of luggage, knapsack, lunch box, waist (fanny) pack, wrist bag, bag for attachment to a belt, camera bag, phone bag, or organizer (e.g. for cosmetics or jewelry). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>a kit includes a pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is insertable in a pouch compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in either of two covers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in its top face. A piece of luggage is shown at left, and an organizer is shown at lower right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The kit also includes a detachable carrying strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a magnetic fastener portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> attached to each end. These correspond to magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the outside ends of the carry bags <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the present invention may have a drawstring closure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or the like rather than a zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Although the drawstring closure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be more difficult for a user to open than a zippered pouch, the drawstring is attractive, particularly where the cover is open at the top. A user can open a drawstring closure by undoing the bow or knot and then widening the tight circle formed by the drawstring closure by coaxing it apart with her hands. This pulls the drawstring through the circular tunnel sewn in the pouch fabric, which widens the opening. The opening can be closed again by pulling the two ends of the drawstring relatively tight and then tying them together. The pouch with drawstring closure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be used by itself with a detachable carrying strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is also attractive when it is inserted in an open straw summer bag cover. The interior ends of the open straw bag or other cover would have magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that correspond to the magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the exterior ends of the inner pouch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is a handbag with a substantially free-standing pouch. The pouch has a zipper or drawstring closure; and the handbag comprises two magnetic snap fasteners, each having a male portion and a corresponding female portion. One magnetic fastener portion is secured to each end face of the pouch, and the opposite two magnetic fastener portions are attached to the circular detachable carry strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another carry bag embodiment. This includes a tiered cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an outer storage pocket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The flexible tiers or straps of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be made of fabric, leather, or any other suitable material. The cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have one tier as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, or several tiers, as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A bottom strap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> supports the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The bottom strap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is contiguous with a flexible attached carry strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. One or more outer storage pockets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be sewn or otherwise secured to one or more tier(s), and optionally the bottom of the outer storage pocket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be secured to the bottom strap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cover. Magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on opposite exterior ends of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> attach to corresponding magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on opposite sides inside the attached carry strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a zipper <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> need not have an outer pocket. In its simplest form without tiers, the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be used as a reinforced strap to replace the detachable carry strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The multi-tiered cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also has a bottom strap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for supporting a pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on opposite exterior ends of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> attach to corresponding magnetic snap fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the inside of opposite sides of an attached carrying strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The broken lines indicate a short (e.g., a handle) or long (shoulder) strap. The inner pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in this figure has a &ldquo;side&rdquo; zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which extends around a substantial portion of the periphery of the top face of the pouch. This zipper closure is conveniently opened by the user using a zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> because the top face of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> extends slightly above the top tier on the cover. The pouch can thus be opened while the tiered handbag is being worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this unique handbag, the pouch material preferably shows between the tiers of the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The tiers may be beaded, fringed, etc., or vibrantly colored to contrast with the color theme of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The tiered cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be lined with fabric that is sewn on or otherwise attached to the tier for added color and texture. A lining can be secured to the attached carry strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or strap below the magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or an opening can be provided in the lining so that the corresponding magnetic portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be connected, thereby securing the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> There may be one or more tiers in the multi-tiered cover. Preferably, the pouch is substantially free-standing, and the cover comprises one or two carry straps, one or two bottom straps, each attached to and contiguous with a carry strap, and at least one tier which is perpendicular to and intersects a carry strap. These straps make up the cover. The bottom straps and the tiers support the pouch in the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the cover comprises: a generally vertical bottom strap supporting the pouch at the bottom; top and bottom tiers extending horizontally around and supporting the pouch; a carry strap attached to and contiguous with the bottom strap; and magnetic snap fastener portions on opposite sides of the inside of the carry strap or tier. The top and bottom tiers are perpendicular to and attached to the carry strap, and the pouch fits snugly into the cover. There may be additional tiers between and parallel to the top and bottom tiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In another variation, a tiered handbag or shoulder bag according to the present invention has two carry straps which are connected at the bottom (by a tier) to form a sling. The pouch sits on the bottom portion of the sling, so that it is supported by these vertical straps. One or more horizontal tier(s) intersect the two carry straps at right angles (to the two carry straps). The horizontal tier(s) support the front and back of the pouch. The magnetic fastener portions are at opposite ends of a horizontal tier. The magnetic fasteners may be on the opposite ends of the outside of the pouch and/or they may be on the front and back faces of the pouch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> three dimensional, trapezoidal-shaped pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on top can be inserted into a cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is part of a knapsack (also called a backpack) carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The backpack carry bag has two straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in back for carrying it. In the embodiment shown, there is a main backpack compartment <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in back for books or other items, and a smaller compartment in front that the pouch fits into snugly. The cover compartment for the pouch in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is covered by an exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Conventional knapsack outer closures can be used. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at each end which are removably secured to corresponding magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside the front cover compartment. There may be other types of pockets or compartments inside the knapsack. This embodiment is convenient for students who do not wish to carry a separate purse or pack, but do not wish to carry their books everywhere. Users could carry books and other items to school in the knapsack. They could then leave their knapsacks in their class or locker, for example, and remove the pouch to carry certain smaller items such as money, cosmetics, sunglasses, and/or keys to lunch or break. On their return, they could slip the pouch back inside the cover compartment in the knapsack. Unlike carrying a purse inside a commonly available knapsack, with the present invention the user need not rummage around inside the knapsack because the pouch will always be fixed in the same place. Also, if the knapsack of the present invention is upset, the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is unlikely to be dislodged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The last figure, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, shows a diaper carry bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with an inner pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with a zipper pull <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Again, the ends of the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> hold corresponding magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which snap into magnetic fastener portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside the cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into a cover compartment on the front of a main diaper bag compartment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> closes the cover compartment over the pouch. The cover compartment is advantageous in that it keeps the pouch separate from the baby items, and in a designated place. The baby items are not contaminated by the personal items in the pouch, and vice versa. It is not necessary to include an exterior flap <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> because the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has its own zipper closure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The magnetic fastener portions could alternatively be placed in a cover compartment within the diaper bag, similar to the cover compartment in the briefcase in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Inner pockets <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are preferably provided in the diaper bag cover, and may be included in various other embodiments herein. An attached carrying strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided for carrying the diaper bag. In use, the pouch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can, for example, be extracted in order to drop off the baby with the rest of the diaper bag at a baby-sitter&apos;s house, or to run to the store without having to take the entire contents of the diaper bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A carry bag may comprise two pouches. In that case, both pouches could fit into interior cover compartments, or one pouch could fit into an interior cover compartment, and one could be inserted into a cover compartment on the front of the carry bag. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>one carry bag has two pouches <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> insertable into an interior pouch compartment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having an interior partition <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a second, exterior pouch compartment in an exterior pocket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Traditional buttons and buttonholes are not employed in the present invention to hold the inner pouch in the cover. The magnetic fasteners of the present invention are advantageous in that they enable the user to remove the pouch very easily and quickly from one cover and quickly and easily reinsert it in another cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention preferably: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> does not comprise an inner pouch or bag with extending strips which project into pockets in the cover; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> does not include eyelets and studs for holding the inner pouch in the cover; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> does not include a spring latch; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> is not an outer decorative fabric cover which the user selects and attaches to a handbag frame; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> does not require flap means associated with an underlying, removable cover to hold the ends of the flaps in order to secure the inner pouch; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> does not include a separable decorative cover which is a one-piece, thin, flexible sheet shaped to cover panels of a bag body in a releasable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The inner pouch of the present invention preferably: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> is not a rigid inner shell member attachable to interchangeable covers; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> is not envelope-shaped, and does not include frame elements or a snap closure, or flexible tape fastener elements; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> is not made of a material that is substantially elastic; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> is not pulled in and out of the cover by means of finger loops; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> does not require attachment to a frame and function as a purse lining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> is not open-mouthed. This is advantageous because, assuming the user has substantially closed the pouch closure, the contents of the pouch will not spill out during transfer between covers or while the pouch is in the cover, regardless of the type of cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it can be realized that the described device of the present invention may be easily and conveniently utilized. While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described using specific terms, this description is for illustrative purposes only. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, and that such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.
