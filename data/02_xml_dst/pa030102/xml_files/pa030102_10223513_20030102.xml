<heading lvl="1">Field of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention lies in the field of applied thermodynamics. More specifically, the present invention relates to an installation for storing thermal energy, i.e., heat energy or cold energy, having pipelines located in the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known to lay in the ground pipelines through which a carrier medium for heat energy or for cold energy is conducted. The earth surrounding the pipelines thereby serves as a thermal store. Prior art plants of this type do not satisfy the requirements, since thermal energy overflows into the ground and flows out of the latter, with the result that it is lost. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide an installation for storing heat energy or cold energy, which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and which is designed in such a way that thermal energy stored in it can be recovered virtually completely and be supplied for use to consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, an installation for storing thermal energy, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> a plurality of mutually concentric, individual regions each containing energy-storing material and including an innermost region, and at least one outer region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a plurality of conduits laid in said individual regions and adapted to be connected to consumers at mutually different temperature levels; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> an electric heating device disposed to heat said innermost region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> at least one pipe coil in said innermost region for connection to an energy source; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> wherein the innermost region is configured to store heat energy with temperatures of between 100&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., and at least one of the conduits is guided out of the innermost region and connected to operate an electric generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In other words, the objects of the invention are achieved in that a plurality of regions are provided which are arranged one in the other and each contain energy-storing material and pipelines and which are insulated relative to the outside, the pipelines arranged in the individual regions being connectable to consumers or to generators of energy with different temperature levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, these regions are of cylindrical or hollow-cylindrical design, and they are arranged concentrically to one another. According to further preferred features, the innermost region is designed with an electric heating device and/or with at least one pipeline for connection to a collector for environmental energy. In this case, in particular, the innermost region is provided for the storage of heat energy with a temperature of between 100&deg; C. and 500&deg; C., the region located outside said innermost region is provided for the storage of energy with a temperature of 80&deg; C. to 50&deg; C., and the region surrounding the latter region is provided for the storage of heat energy with a temperature of 50&deg; C. to 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a concomitant feature of the invention, a reflector is provided on the inside of at least one of the regions. Furthermore, the plant may be formed by a vessel which is manufactured in a way known per se from concrete and in which the pipelines are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in an installation for storing heat energy or cold energy, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the sole figure of the drawing in detail, there is illustrated an installation for storing thermal energy that is located in the ground. The installation or plant has an inner first wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, also a second wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located outside the first wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, outside the second wall <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a third wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The three walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> define three regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are in each case located one inside the other and are filled with a material which has a very high thermal storage effect. The storage material may be formed, for example, by concrete or clay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> All these walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are produced from thermally insulating material. Moreover, a bottom plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a cover plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which are likewise produced from thermally insulating material, are provided, by means of which the regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are closed off upwardly and downwardly. Furthermore, a thermal reflector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided on the inside of the wall <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, these walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be located within a vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is produced, for example, from reinforced concrete and likewise has a jacket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and which is designed with a bottom plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and with a cover plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Outside the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> there is located a further pipeline <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of a ground collector or earth collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A plurality of pipelines located respectively in the regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The pipelines <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are surrounded by the storage material and their connections are led out of the regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Finally, the region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has located in it at least one heating device which is formed by an electric heater <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, by an environmental collector connected to one of the pipelines <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and/or by another generator for heat energy. The heater <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected via an electrical line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to photovoltaic elements or to a line for excess electrical energy. A heat carrier or cold carrier, such as glycol or oil, may be conducted through the pipelines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A number of boxes with descriptive labels are diagrammatically illustrated above ground. The devices and connections associated with these boxes will become clear from the following description of the operation of the plant: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By means of the at least one heating device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> located in the innermost region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or by means of a further generator of heat energy, the region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is heated to a temperature of 100&deg; C. to 500&deg; C., the energy being stored in this region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Heat energy with a very high temperature is thereby available, which may be transmitted to a consumer that requires a supply of high temperature. This energy is used for operating an electric generator, for example via the line <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which is led out. In addition, a heating boiler, a hot-water generator, a baking oven and the like may also be fed with this energy content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Heat energy which flows out of the innermost region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> radially outward, passes into the region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which surrounds this region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and in which is located a heat carrier having a temperature of 50&deg; C. to 100&deg; C. Via the pipelines <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> located in this region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, medium is transmitted to a second group of consumers, such as a hot-water generation system, a heating system, or the like. Located in the third region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> surrounding the second region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a heat carrier with a temperature of 25&deg; C. to 50&deg; C. which is transmitted via the pipelines <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to a third group of consumers having a lower temperature requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> However, not only is heat energy extracted from the regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, but heat energy may also be fed into all these regions. There are therefore three regions with different temperature levels, from which in each case heat energy with that temperature which is required for the respective consumers can be extracted and into which heat energy in each case with that temperature level which is required by generators of heat energy is likewise fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The sources or generators of heat energy are in this case photovoltaic elements, heat collectors, heat pumps, plants from which waste heat is discharged, heat pumps and the like. It is critical, in this context, that the available heat energy is always fed into that region or extracted from that region which has the corresponding temperature level. Moreover, for example, electrical energy may be converted into thermal energy and stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Since the individual regions with different temperature levels are arranged one inside the other, heat energy flowing out of the innermost region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not lost, but passes into the outer region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> surrounding the innermost region. This likewise applies to heat energy flowing out of the region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An outflow of energy from the innermost region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is largely avoided by means of the reflector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Insofar as a large plant is concerned, this may be made in the ground by the walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being produced for the regions <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the case of smaller plants, these walls may be arranged in the vessel <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is set in the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A plant of this type may also be used in a similar way for the storage of cold energy. </paragraph>
