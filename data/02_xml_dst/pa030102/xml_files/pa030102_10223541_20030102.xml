<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This patent proposes a device for turning brake disks that includes an automatic compensation unit that functions to automatically compensate for runout between a lathe applied directly to the vehicle, and the brake disk to be turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The device according to this innovation has the advantage of being able to use an automatic alignment tool so that the job of turning the brake disks can even be entrusted to personnel without specific preparation or expertise. It also saves time compared to traditional manual systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It consists, in other words, of a device that allows totally automatic detecting of runout of the brake disk to be turned and consequently, using a suitable calculator, transforms signals coming from the detector into controls for an electromagnetic actuator that acts on a triad of rotating adjustment devices controlling the distance between the two faces of the alignment device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is known, disk brakes used on motor vehicles are subject to substantial frictional forces from brake caliper shoes, and undergo wear with the passage of time and periodically require replacement of the shoes and, if necessary, turning of the surface of the disk when the surface is found to be grooved by the shoes beyond admissible maximum values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is also known that the surface of the disk, in addition to the formation of grooves caused by shoe friction, is also subject to other forces that cause lateral warping of the disk. These abnormalities must also be detected and corrected during turning procedures since they could jeopardize the safety of the vehicle by generating dangerous vibrations during braking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One of the main components of a vehicle wheel braking system employing disk brakes are the brake disks or brake rotors which provide a solid rotating surface against which the stationary brake friction pads are clamped or compressed to generate a frictional force, slowing the rotational movement of the brake disks or brake rotors and the associated vehicle wheels. These brake disks or brake rotors are subjected to repeated and substantial frictional forces by the brake friction pads, and over time, become worn. Uneven application of braking force, debris, or uneven frictional surfaces on the brake friction pads can result in the formation of grooves, channels, or scratches in the surfaces of the brake disks or brake rotors. Repeated heating and cooling of the brake disk or brake rotor resulting in extreme temperature variations can additionally result in the lateral warping of the brake disk or brake rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A worn or warped brake disk or brake rotor may be resurfaced by cutting or grinding to provide a uniform smooth brake friction pad contact surface if sufficient brake disk or brake rotor material remains to provide an adequate braking surface without compromising the structural integrity of the vehicle braking system. However, once a brake disk or brake rotor has been worn below a minimum safe thickness, it is unable to safely dissipate the heat generated by a brake application, and must be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To provide for a uniform surface, any abnormalities in the brake disk or brake rotor, such as a lateral warping must be detected and compensated for during the resurfacing procedures. An additional source of lateral warping defects in a brake rotor or brake disk is often over tightened attachment bolts or an uneven mounting surface onto which the brake disk or brake rotor is secured in the vehicle wheel assembly. If the brake disk or brake rotor is removed from the vehicle wheel assembly for a resurfacing operation, any abnormalities or defects resulting from the mounting of the brake disk or brake rotor to the vehicle wheel assembly may not be accurately identified or corrected during the resurfacing procedure. Accordingly, a variety of brake resurfacing machines or brake lathes have been developed to resurface brake disks and brake rotors while they remain mounted to the vehicle wheel assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At the present time, to detect and correct warping of the disk surface, monitoring devices are used to determine disk runout and to correct disk deformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These devices are of various types although recently the sector has seen increasingly widespread use of lathes applied directly to the hub of the vehicle. These avoid the need to remove the brake disk and consequently speed up the entire repair process and also, in addition, perform repair with greater precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is necessary for these devices that the lathe applied to the wheel be subsequently aligned with the axis of the wheel hub because the lathe is mounted on the axle using the wheel hub itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, the wheel hub, either because of manufacturing defects or due to the presence of rust that forms at the points where the fastening screws are tightened or due to deformation caused by excessive tightening of the heel fastening screws, is never perfectly aligned with its own axle and this runout must be corrected in order to turn the brake disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Known equipment for turning brake disks generally include a support on which the lathe is mounted, a motor that drives the disk to be turned and an alignment and compensation device. This device may be manual or automatic depending on the model of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> If the alignment device is the manual type then the machine operator corrects for runout detected by optical or electronic devices by correcting suitable manual adjusters that align the lathe axis with that of the disk in order to perform correct turning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This system has the problem that the operator who uses it must have a great deal of experience in correcting compensation parameters. As a consequence it is not suited for personnel without special expertise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the automatic version correction is no longer done manually but is done using special automatic detection and adjustment devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The main problem these devices present is the difficulty they have in correctly detecting runout between the hub and the relative disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Brake resurfacing machines or brake lathes configured to resurface brake disks and brake rotors mounted to a vehicle wheel assembly are commonly referred to as on-car brake lathes. By eliminating the need to remove the brake disk or brake rotor from the vehicle wheel assembly, the overall efficiency of the resurfacing procedure is improved, and the chances for operator induced error are reduced. However, the resurfacing of brake disks and brake rotors which remain mounted to the vehicle wheel assembly requires that the on-car brake lathe and the vehicle wheel assembly, including the brake disk or brake rotor, be aligned along a common axis, typically, the axis of the vehicle wheel assembly hub onto which the on-car brake lathe is secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Often, the hub surface to which the vehicle wheel assembly mounts, is not aligned within a required tolerance to the axis of rotation for the axle upon which the vehicle wheel assembly is secured. This deviation between the hub surface and the axis of rotation for the wheel assembly is referred to as lateral runout, and must be compensated for either manually or automatically before beginning the resurfacing procedures with the on-car brake lathe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Manual runout compensation procedures are tedious and complex. First, an operator secures the on-car brake lathe to the vehicle wheel hub using a suitable adapter. Next, a motor in the on-car brake lathe is activated to rotate the adapter and brake disk or brake rotor. Any runout present in the system is measured by one or more measurement devices, which provide the operator with a suitable visual indication representative of the actual runout experienced by the on-car brake lathe as the adapter is rotated through one or more complete rotations. Using the visual indication, the operator manually adjusts one or more mechanical adjustment elements, such as screws or dials, altering the rotational axis of the on-car brake lathe to reduce the observed runout to within an acceptable tolerance for performing the resurfacing of the brake disk or brake rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To reduce the observed runout to within the desired tolerances using the manual runout compensation procedure usually requires several iterations when carried out by a skilled operator. The extra time spent by an operator to setup the on-car brake lathe and perform the manual runout compensation can substantially increase the time required to complete a brake disk resurfacing, resulting in a corresponding increase in cost and lost productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Several solutions, such as that one relating to patents WO 98/10262 and WO 98/09754 registered on behalf of Joseph Willey, are known that have, for example, runout compensation devices where detection is performed by an accelerometer device which, after a certain number of revolutions, determines misalignment and the relative compensation plane to act on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This system presents the problem of slowness in display of the amount of runout because the device must perform several revolutions to get in phase and determine the compensation plane even if runout is very small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A number of on-car brake lathe devices have been configured with automatic runout compensation mechanisms which do not require significant operator input. One such automatic runout compensation mechanism is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,101,911 to Newell et al. (the &apos;911 Newell et al. patent). The automatic runout compensation mechanism shown in the &apos;911 Newell et al. patent includes at least one adjustment disc interposed between a pair of adapters and which is concentric about a axial drive shaft. The on-car brake lathe motor and cutting elements are secured to one adapter, and the entire mechanism secured to the vehicle wheel hub via the second adapter. The adjustment disc includes a slanted surface in engagement with either a second adjustment disc having an opposing slanted surface or one of the adapters. An adjustment mechanism is utilized to alter the rotational orientation of the adjustment disc about the axis of the axial drive shaft. Runout is detected by a rotational accelerometer, which provides control signals to the adjustment mechanism. Alteration of the rotation position of the adjustment disc about the axis of the axial drive shaft compensates for the detected runout by altering the angle at which the two slanted surfaces are engaged, and correspondingly the angle between the first and second adapters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The adjustment mechanism of the &apos;911 Newell et al. patent associated with the use of the one or more slant discs is a complex mechanical arrangement, requiring initial phasing of the adjustment discs and a lengthy trial-and-error adjustment process to compensate for any detected runout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for on-car brake lathes having improved automatic runout compensation mechanisms, and which can quickly and accurately compensate for detected runout. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to achieve an automatic runout compensation device for brake disk turning equipment which includes a system that is able to perform real detection of runout because it employs a direct feeler type of system and does not use an accelerometer device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The innovation in question, as part of this general object, proposes use of a system that displays the amount of runout both during realignment and at the end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The device according to the innovation offers the advantage of reducing alignment times because the aligning joint, since it can be zeroed before application, starts compensating from the very start of rotation unlike the known devices that must dedicate several revolutions to get in phase before they start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, according to the innovation and thanks to the possibility of zeroing the screws, alignment time becomes proportional to the runout that is detected so that realignment is practically instantaneous in case of small runout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the innovation is the fact that no special attention is required when tightening the screws that fasten the lathe to the vehicle&apos;s hub. These can be tightened all the way without fear of blocking the alignment mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned objects and advantages are all achieved, according to the invention, by a device for turning brake disks or the like that includes an automatic runout compensation unit, characterized by the fact that a special runout detecting device, at least one device for elaborating the centering device control signals and a special aligning joint are installed on the support that can be mounted on the hub of the vehicle and by the fact that this runout detecting device is composed of a linear movement detector preferably of the type with an electronic comparator using LVDT technology or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Briefly stated, the present invention provides an on-car brake lathe system for the resurfacing of a brake disk or brake rotor which remains mounted to a vehicle wheel assembly. The on-car brake lathe system includes a lathe body, a drive motor, a cutting head, and a mounting chuck driven by the drive motor. The on-car brake lathe system further includes an aligning joint having a pair of mounting flanges concentrically disposed about the rotational axis of the mounting chuck, one of which is secured to the mounting chuck, and the other of which is configured for securing the on-car brake lathe system to a vehicle wheel assembly. An automatic runout compensation mechanism is disposed between the pair of flanges, securing the first flange and the second flange together at an adjustable inclination or alignment angle. The automatic runout compensation mechanism includes three discrete adjustment elements equidistantly disposed about the mounting chuck rotational axis, and is configured to adjust the relative inclination or alignment angle between the pair of flanges to provide runout compensation between the rotational axis of the drive shaft and the rotational axis of the vehicle wheel assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the on-car brake lathe system of the present invention, each adjustment element includes two opposing surfaces, each having an opposed helical channel, between which are contained a number of ball bearings. At least one of the opposing surfaces and corresponding helical channels is configured for controlled rotation about a central axis aligned parallel to the chuck rotational axis. As the opposing surface and helical channel rotate about the central axis, the ball bearings maintain a minimum spacing between the opposed helical channels, varying the spacing between the opposing surfaces in direct relation to the depth of the rotated helical channel. Displacement of the spacing between the opposing surfaces alters the relative alignment angle between the pair of flanges, providing for runout compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the on-car brake lathe system of the present invention, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) device is provided to generate signals representative of runout present in the mounting of the on-car brake lathe to a vehicle wheel hub. The signals representative of the detected runout are utilized to control the adjustment of each of the discrete adjustment elements to reduce the detected runout to within a required tolerance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention as well as presently preferred embodiments thereof will become more apparent from the reading of the following description in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> b) a device for elaborating the control signals to send to the centering device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> c) a special aligning joint indicated as a whole by the number <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and driven by motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, on-car brake lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in relation to a vehicle wheel brake disk or brake rotor D to be resurfaced. The on-car brake lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a support structure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, onto which is mounted a drive motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an adjustable cutting head T, a mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a runout detecting device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Additionally included on the support structure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a control panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> including a microprocessor card acting as a processing apparatus for processing control signals for the detecting device or means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Control panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provides one or more operator controls and an associated display <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which is linked to the microprocessor card. Display <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is preferably a histogram-type display, composed of a row of light emitting diodes (LEDs) or similar device, or alternatively, a digital-type display providing an indication of the amount of runout detected by the runout detecting device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The drive motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is coupled to the mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through a drive mechanism (not shown) contained within the support structure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to rotate the mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> about a drive axis DA. An aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is secured to the mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, concentric with the drive axis DA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To detachably secure the brake lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a vehicle wheel brake disk or brake rotor H to be resurfaced, an adapter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is secured to the vehicle wheel brake disk or brake rotor H using the vehicle wheel lug nuts or retaining bolts (not shown). Next, the brake lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moved into position such that the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and drive axis DA are substantially in line with a central axis of the adapter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, corresponding to the rotational axis WA of the vehicle wheel brake disk or brake rotor H. A threaded retaining shaft <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is passed axial through the support structure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and engaged with an axial threaded receiving bore (not shown) in the adapter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Tightening of the threaded retaining shaft seats the adapter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> against the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and secures the brake lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the vehicle wheel brake disk or brake rotor H to be resurfaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The runout detecting device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> basically consists of a linear movement detector meaning an electronic comparator preferably using LVDT technology or the like, that is firmly fastened to the lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a position suitably distant from the rotation axis of aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to amplify the effect of the runout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The detecting device also includes reference element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> applied each time to the chassis E of the vehicle or to another fixed part and that is positioned in contact with the mobile element of the movement detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The mobile part of the detector, that consists of a cylindrical cursor, is therefore cyclically moved a distance proportional to the runout during rotation of the lathe axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The detector, that also acts as a transducer, transforms the amount of movement into an electrical signal that varies in amplitude and direction depending on the amount and direction of the movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The appliance for elaborating the signals and for controlling the centering device consists of a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; programmed electronic circuit or microprocessor card used to elaborate the signals coming from the detector and to control an electromagnetic type of linear actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that acts on a triad of rotary units that adjust the distance between the two faces of alignment device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> This device is also furnished with a histogram-type display, made using a row of LEDs or similar devices or a digital-type display that shows the amount of runout while alignment is being performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is composes of two flanges <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected one (flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) to the axis or chuck DA of the lathe and the other (flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) to the vehicle&apos;s hub and facing each other through a connection that allows the relative inclination of the faces to be varied. The lathe has a tool T for turning disk D on support <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> This joint is quipped with an electromagnetic type of linear actuator able to act on the devices that vary the relative inclinations of the faces in function of the controls received from the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the aligning joint consists of two half-joints in the form of flanges <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that face each other across three contact points indicated by the letter C and mutually placed at 120 degree intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The two half-joints are held in mutual adherence by six screws <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and six sets of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whereas drive transmission takes place through stake <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Each of the three points of contact C on flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> consists of a female lead nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the form of an annular groove having a varying depth groove in a part P, the length of which corresponds to a single rotation of a cylindrical propeller of suitable pitch, for example 0.6 mm and balls S between groove <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a complementary screw <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, also in the form of an annular groove of varying depth on the opposite flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, of screw <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the same length as lead nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The screw can rotate around pin <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> applied to flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When screw <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is rotated its thread rises or lowers sliding on the thread of lead nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This creates detachment in case of unscrewing and approach in case of screwing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A row of suitable diameter balls (for example 5.5 mm) has been inserted between screw and lead nut in order to reduce the friction generated by this maneuver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Design is such that if all three screws <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are screwed all the way in the opposite faces of the two flanges <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are parallel because the two flanges rest against each other. This zero condition is achieved by the machine operator, using suitable wrench, before starting the alignment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The two faces become inclined with respect to each other by rotating even just one of the three screws <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Since these screws are placed at 120 degrees intervals then any relative orientation can be obtained by suitably and variably rotating all three of the screws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> These screws have been demultiplied by a pair of gears (pinion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and ring gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) to achieve greater precision in rotation of the screws by a force external to the joint. Gear or toothed wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has also been applied to shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of pinion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> equipped with a sawtooth extension that can be driven by an external actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It is now easily understood, by the way the relative orientation of the two half-joints can be varied, how this relative orientation can be achieved while the joint is rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In fact it is sufficient for the actuator to enter into the trajectory of a gear in order to obtain variation of the orientation plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The desired alignment, thanks to the combined effect of the runout detector and the elaboration and actuator drive equipment, can be achieved in just a few seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> We shall now briefly describe an example of operation of the compensation device illustrated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The axis is made to rotate by motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> once lathe <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been mounted on the vehicle&apos;s hub H, and the fixed reference part for sensor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The exact moment the sensor detects maximum displacement the actuator automatically intervenes on the adjustor, so to reduce this amount acting on one of the three contact points on flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a short time the actuator, acting on all three adjustors, inclines the two flanges of the alignment device relative to each other in order to reach minimum displacement values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For example displacement values can be considered lower than a real amount of 0.04 mm equal to 0.0016 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above the device according to the innovation offers the advantage of reducing alignment times because the aligning joint, which can be zeroed prior to application, starts compensating immediately when it begins to rotate, unlike devices which, because they usually start with a random element, need several rotations before they start entering into phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another important advantage of the innovation compared to known solutions is due to the fact that, thanks to the possibility of zeroing the screws, alignment time becomes proportional to the amount of runout that is detected so that realignment is practically immediate for cases of only slight runout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Turning next to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present invention is described in greater detail. The aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, configured to seat against the adapter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> configured for attachment to the mounting chuck <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with one or more retaining bolts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> seats in a peripheral recess <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and encloses the outer circumference of the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is secured to the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by an overlapping edge <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> of an annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As will be described below in greater detail, the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is connected to the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a connection configured to permit adjustment of the relative inclination of front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, drive transmission from the mounting chuck through the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is conveyed to the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through a stake or drive pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Drive pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> seats partially within a recessed bore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and partially within a passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Drive pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is constrained by the recessed bore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> against lateral or radial movement, but is permitted to move parallel to the drive axis, so as not to impede adjustment of the relative inclination of the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are secured in mutual adherence by a set of retaining screws or bolts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which pass through bores <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, bores <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and thread into threaded bores <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Disposed about each of the retaining screws <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, between the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are sets of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, six sets of retaining screws or bolts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are utilized, with each set of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> consisting of eight individual Belleville washers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Each set of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exerts a preload force between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is constrained by the retaining screws <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The preload force urges the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> towards the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such that the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a gap G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). As is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is secured in mutual adherence to the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a connection configured to permit adjustment of the relative inclination of front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the compression of one or more sets of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a reduction in the size of gap G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Turning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an automatic runout compensation mechanism is shown generally at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, consisting of at least one adjustment element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Adjustment element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is configured to compress one or more sets of Belleville washers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by exerting a force parallel to the drive axis DA, separating the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a non-uniform manner. Non-uniform separation of the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> from the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> results in a change in the relative inclination or alignment angle between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, three adjustment elements <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are circumferentially disposed equidistantly about the drive axis DA, at 120 degree intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Each adjustment element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> consists of a pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> passes through a bore <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with a longitudinal axis of rotation AA parallel to the drive axis DA. A ring bearing structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is disposed within the bore <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is secured for rotational movement within the bearing structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> by a snap-ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is secured about the pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, perpendicular to the drive axis DA. Gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a radial dimension greater than the radial dimension of the pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, defining a rear face <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a front face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A set of roller bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are disposed between the rear face <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the front face <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of uniform pitch, occasionally referred to as a screw or female screw by those skilled in the art, is formed in the front face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, concentric with the axis AA of pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a depth or pitch X, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> which varies about the circumference of the helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A lead nut or second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an identical depth or pitch X, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is integrally formed in the rear face <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, opposite each helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Each helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and opposed second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> define a generally helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between the rear face <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the front face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Disposed within each helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are a number of suitably sized ball bearings S having a diameter fitted to the deepest portion of the helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Preferably, twelve ball bearings S seat within helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, providing a reduced friction sliding and/or rolling surface between the helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Rotation of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> about axis AA of the pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> causes the first helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in face <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to correspondingly rotate about axis AA. The second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposed to first helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is integrally formed in the rear face <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and as such, cannot rotate about axis AA. Absent the presence of the ball bearings S in the helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> defined between channels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the diameter of the helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is altered in direct proportion to the rotation of the first helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> about axis AA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in an initial or &ldquo;zero&rdquo; inclination position, helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are aligned such that the helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a generally uniform diameter within which ball bearings S are constrained, i.e. the transition point TP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> between the portion having the greatest depth and the portion having the shallowest depth is aligned with the transition point TP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between the portion having the greatest depth and the portion having the shallowest depth. In this position, front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is parallel to, and in contact with, rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As the helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is rotated about axis AA by gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the alignment between transition point TP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and TP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is removed. Progressively shallower portions of each helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are rotated into alignment with each other until a &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; inclination adjustment position is reached, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in which the shallowest portion or each helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in alignment. At the point of &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; inclination, helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> would have a non-uniform diameter absent the presence of ball bearings S. Continued rotation of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> about axis AA past the point of &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; inclination returns the adjustment element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the initial position or point of &ldquo;zero&rdquo; inclination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The presence of ball bearings S in the helical passage <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> provides a wedge or cam action between helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> directed parallel to axis AA, maintaining a separation distance between helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> equal to the diameter of each ball bearing S. Gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> upon which helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed is restrained from movement along axis AA in a first direction by snap-ring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and from movement along axis AA in the opposite direction by roller bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the wedge or cam action of ball bearings S resulting from the rotation of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> about axis AA results in the tilting of front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, within which second helical channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed, away from helical channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This tilting can be seen by the presence of gap &ldquo;G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and the absence of gap &ldquo;G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and the presence of opposing gap &ldquo;G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, an actuation mechanism <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is shown for engagement with gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each alignment element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is associated with an individual actuation mechanism <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Actuation mechanism <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> comprises a shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> disposed parallel to pin or shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> seats within a ring bearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> disposed in a bore <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in annular face plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A snap-ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> restrains shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from axial motion through ring bearing <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> further seats within a ring bearing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> disposed in a bore <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A portion of shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extends through ring bearing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and beyond the rear face <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Pinion gear <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is disposed about shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, between front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and in engagement with gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Pinion gear <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is selected such that the engagement between pinion gear <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides a de-multiplier effect to achieve greater precision in the rotation of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> about axis AA, and correspondingly, in the wedge or cam action exerted to incline the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> To provide for a rotational force on shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, tooth wheel or gear <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is secured to the portion of shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extending beyond the rear face <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is selectively engaged with a retractable actuator pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from an external actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Each engagement between retractable actuator pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ratchets the wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about the rotational axis of shaft <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, driving pinion gear <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, resulting in the rotation of gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> about axis AA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> During operation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each complete rotation of the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> about axis DA in the direction of the arrow labeled &ldquo;ROTATION&rdquo; brings each actuation mechanism <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and associated wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> past external actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> one time. If retractable actuator pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is extended, the rotation of the aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> brings wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into engagement with retractable actuator pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, such that wheel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates in the direction of the arrow labeled &ldquo;ACTUATION&rdquo; as the rotation of aligning joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> continues. A corresponding rotation occurs in gear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow labeled &ldquo;ADJUSTMENT&rdquo;, altering the inclination angle between the front flange <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the rear flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the adjustment joint <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The lathe in question employs a microprocessor card to perform automatic alignment between the axis of the lathe and the axis of the wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> At start-up the flange of the machine is in rotation together with the brake disk at a frequency equal to the 50 Hz or 60 Hz power grid frequency, with automatic measurements being made by the control card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The alignment error is measured through a linear transfer transducer (composed of a differential transformer (LVDT) and a central core the position of which generates a signal proportional to its position) and is converted into a sinusoidal wave with a frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the flange and with amplitude proportional to the mount of error. Since one sinusoidal wave period corresponds to one revolution of the flange (and the disk) there are two key pieces of information that can be measured from this wave: the amount of error and the position of the maximum error within a space of 360 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Correction is performed by an actuator that acts on one of the three gears spaces at 120 degree intervals and positioned on the flange. The actuator, to be sure to act on at least one of these gears, must be controlled for a time interval equal to a 120 degree rotation of the disk. This duration of this time interval is calculated by the microprocessor based on grid frequency at the start of the correction cycle. This duration remains the same for the entire work cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The choice of which gear to act on is made based on the maximum position of the sinusoidal wave within the period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> During the correction cycle one period is used by the microprocessor to acquire the error sinusoidal wave and the next period is used to make the actual correction by controlling the actuator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The correction cycle terminates when the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave drops below a certain threshold, preset by software. In reality there are two thresholds: the operator can choose whether to be satisfied by a first correction, always in any case within the tolerances prescribed by the vehicle manufacturers&apos; specifications, or whether to try to achieve a lower threshold, better suited to high speed and sporting vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention are achieved and other advantageous results are obtained. As various changes could be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
