<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an exposure apparatus used when producing a semiconductor integrated circuit, a liquid crystal display element, a thin film magnetic head, or another microdevice using lithography and to an illumination apparatus which may be applied for such an exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the lithographic process for producing a microdevice, use is made of an exposure apparatus to transfer a circuit pattern to be formed on a photomask (including reticle) on to a semiconductor wafer, glass plate, or other photosensitive substrate. Further improvement of the resolution is being demanded for improving the integration degree of such microdevices. To meet these demands, exposure apparatuses are being designed which use illumination light of shorter wavelengths such as from the g-rays (wavelength 436 nm) or i-rays (wavelength 365 nm) of mercury lamps to KrF excimer laser light (wavelength 248 nm) or Arf excimer laser light (wavelength 193 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An excimer laser emits pulse light by discharge in a laser medium (gas). The wavelength spectral width &Dgr;&lgr; of general excimer lasers is about 500 pm (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;10 </superscript></highlight>m) as shown by the broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. When used as the light source of an exposure apparatus, however, it is necessary to narrow the spectral width &Dgr;&lgr; to less than about 1 pm as shown by the solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> so as to suppress chromatic aberration etc. of the optical lenses mounted in the exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The wavelength spectral width is narrowed by an optical prism, Fabry-Perot etalon, grating, or other wavelength selection element alone or in combination. The variation in the thus narrowed center wavelength of the laser has to be controlled to as low as &plusmn;0.1 pm with respect to the reference wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this way, the excimer laser light source used for exposure apparatuses inevitably becomes complicated in structure due to the need for control etc. Further, the discharge electrode has to be made longer to make up for the loss of laser output resulting from the narrowing. Accordingly, the excimer laser light source becomes complicated and large in size. The components are also high in price and the running costs high as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In general, however, plants manufacturing microdevices install several exposure apparatuses in a clean room. The usual practice is to provide such an excimer laser light source for each exposure apparatus. Each excimer laser light source, as explained above, is complicated and large in size in hardware configuration and is high in initial cost and running costs, so overall a large space is required for the installation of the light sources. This becomes a cause for higher costs as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To deal with this problem, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-154527, it has been proposed to use a single laser light source and selectively supply laser light for exposure to a plurality of exposure units (exposure stages). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be explained in brief with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the laser light emitted from a laser light source <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is selectively sent to a plurality of exposure units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D through a light path switch comprised of a light path switching controller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a plurality of mirrors <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>D. That is, the mirrors <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>C are movable mirrors able to be changed in position. The positions of the mirrors <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>C are changed under the control of the light path switching controller <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, whereby the laser light from the light source <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is guided selectively to one of the exposure units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D and used for exposure by the corresponding exposure unit (one of <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, since it is sufficient to provide just a single laser light source <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for four exposure units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D, the configuration becomes simpler, the hardware becomes more compact, and the initial cost becomes cheaper compared with providing a laser light source for each of the exposure units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to this technique, however, since light is supplied from a single light source to a plurality of exposure units, the distance of transmission of the light inevitably becomes longer, it is difficult to maintain the precision of alignment of the optical elements in the light path, and, due in part to this, there is a large loss of light. This problem becomes particularly notable in the case of short wavelength light like KrF excimer laser light of a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser light of a wavelength of 193 nm. Therefore, to compensate for this loss, it is necessary to increase the output of the light source. The light source becomes larger in size or shorter in service life and the initial cost and running costs rise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, in a laser light source, even before the end of the service life of the light source as a whole is reached, maintenance such as exchange of the gas or exchange of worn out parts has to be performed periodically or upon need. In the above art, however, since it is necessary for a single light source to provide the pulses used for the plurality of exposure units, the frequently of maintenance becomes high and the time until reaching the end of the service life becomes shorter. Not that great a reduction in the running costs can therefore be hoped for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, since light from a single light source is selectively sent to the exposure units, more than one exposure units cannot simultaneously perform exposure work. Therefore, the throughput (amount of production per unit time) is liable to fall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, when increasing the number of exposure units so as to increase the production capacity in the above art, the light source itself has to be changed to a higher output one etc. It is structurally difficult to flexibly deal with such changes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an exposure apparatus and illumination apparatus enabling a reduction of size and reduction of costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an exposure apparatus able to improve the throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide an exposure apparatus able to flexibly handle changes in the production capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exposure apparatus comprising a single light source for emitting light, a plurality of exposure units for performing exposure using illumination light derived from the light from the light source, a light transmitter having a plurality of light paths for optically connecting the light source and the exposure units, and a plurality of amplifiers, provided in the light paths corresponding to the exposure units, for amplifying the light from the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the exposure apparatus of the present invention, since a single light source is provided for a plurality of exposure units and each exposure unit is just provided with an amplifier, but no light source, the overall apparatus is smaller in size and lower in cost. In addition to this, since an amplifier for amplifying the light from the light source is provided corresponding to each of the exposure units, a light source which is low in output, that is, small in size and inexpensive in price, can be used and can be extended in service life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the initial cost required for the light source itself and the running costs can be greatly reduced. Further, since the energy of the light transmitted over the light paths from the light source to the exposure units is small, the optical components (for example, lenses, mirrors, optical fibers, etc.) constituting the light transmitter optically connecting these may be ones of relatively low price and may be extended in service life. The cost can be further reduced by this as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Note that some cost is of course required along with the provision of the amplifiers, but amplifiers, unlike light sources, do not need a unit for narrowing the spectral width etc., so are generally inexpensive. The cost can be reduced compared with the rise in cost of the light source, light transmitter, etc. resulting from the use of a large output light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, since light is supplied from a single light source to a plurality of exposure units through amplifiers, even if the distance of transmission of the light becomes longer, the loss can be compensated by the amplifiers and there is no need for increasing the output of the light source itself. Therefore, even when using short wavelength light such as KrF excimer laser light of a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser light of a wavelength of 193 nm, there is no need to increase the output of the light source so as to compensate for the resultant loss, the increase in size and reduction in service life of the light source can be suppressed, and the cost can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While not particularly limited to this, as the light source, it is possible to use an excimer laser, other gas laser, a dye laser, a stationary laser, a semiconductor laser, etc. It is also possible to use a lamp light source other than a laser light source. Further, as the amplifier, an injection locking type excimer laser amplifier can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As the light source, it is possible to use one emitting light of the same wavelength as the illumination light which the exposure units use for the exposure work. Further, as the light source, it is possible to use one emitting light of a wavelength different from the wavelength of the illumination light which the exposure units use for the exposure work. In this case, a plurality of wavelength converters for converting the light from the light source to the wavelength of the illumination light used by the exposure units are provided for the corresponding exposure units. These wavelength converters may be positioned either before or after the corresponding amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The light transmitter may be provided with a distributor and the light from the light source distributed equally or unequally to the amplifiers by the distributor. By doing this, one exposure unit can perform exposure work when necessary without regard as to whether other exposure units are performing-exposure work and all of the exposure units can simultaneously perform exposure work in parallel, so the throughput can be improved. This light transmitter, however, may also be provided with a light path switch for selectively sending the light from the light source to one of the amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, the light transmitter preferably includes optical fiber cables. This is because by transmitting light by an optical fiber cable, the adjustment of the alignment etc. among the lenses, mirrors, and other optical elements for transmitting light becomes simpler, the misalignment of position among optical elements can be reduced, and the loss of light can be reduced. By using optical fiber cables, there is the additional advantage that the freedom of layout of the exposure units can also be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this case, with a normal optical fiber cable using quartz etc., transmission of short wavelength light like that of a KrF excimer laser (wavelength 248 nm) or ArF excimer (wavelength 193 nm) is generally not possible due to the large loss, but as explained above this can be dealt with by having the light source emit light of a relatively long wavelength (for example, a wavelength of 500 nm or more) able to be sent over this optical fiber cable, transmitting this to near the exposure units using optical fiber cables, and using wavelength converters to convert it to a wavelength of the short wavelength light used by the exposure units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While not particularly limited to this, the amplifiers may be provided near the illumination optical systems of the exposure units. By doing this, there is almost no distance of transmission of light from the amplifiers to the exposure units, the loss of light can be reduced, and greater efficiency can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, further, according to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an illumination apparatus compreising a single light source for emitting light, a light transmitter having a plurality of light paths for transmitting light from the light source, and a plurality of amplifiers, provided corresponding to the plurality of light paths, for amplifying the light from the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By applying the illumination apparatus of the present invention to an exposure apparatus having a plurality of exposure units, similar actions and effects as the above exposure apparatus of the present invention can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, according to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exposure system comprising a master apparatus having a light source for emitting light, a first exposure unit for performing exposure work using illumination light derived from the light from the light source, a first light transmitter having a first light path for optically connecting the light source and the first exposure unit, and a first amplifier, provided in the first light path, for amplifying the light from the light source and a splitter, provided in the first light path, for splitting the light and able to be expanded later by the addition of at least one slave apparatus each having a second exposure unit for performing exposure work using illumination light derived from the light from the light source, a second light transmitter having a second light path for optically connecting the splitter and the second exposure unit, and a second amplifier, provided in the second light path, for amplifying the light from the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As the splitter, it is possible to use a distributor for equally or unequally distributing light to the first amplifier and the second amplifier. Further, as the splitter, it is possible to use a light path switch for switching the supply of light selectively to the first amplifier and the second amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The splitter may be provided in the master apparatus and disabled before the addition of any slave apparatuses or the splitter may be provided in a slave apparatus and therefore added when adding a slave apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the exposure apparatus of this aspect of the present invention, since a master apparatus provided with a single light source is provided in advance and then one or more slave apparatuses not provided with light sources may be added later together or successively as needed, it is possible to flexibly deal with increases in production capacity. Further, since no separate light source is required at the time of expansion, the cost of expansion can be kept low. Further, since the slave apparatuses are provided with amplifiers, there is no need to change the light source to a high output one along with expansion.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments will be explained in detail next with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view of the general configuration of an exposure system of a first embodiment of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a view of the configuration of an exposure unit of this exposure system, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view of the configuration of a light source of the exposure system, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a view of the configuration of an amplifier of the exposure system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The exposure system (exposure apparatus), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is comprised of an illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a plurality of exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Exposure Units&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D are configured substantially the same as ordinary exposure apparatuses except that they are not provided with independent light sources. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, four units are shown, but the system may have two or three or five or more units as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> First, an explanation will be given of the configuration of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Here, it is assumed that the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D have identical configurations, so the explanation is given of the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is a step-and-scan type reduction projection type exposure apparatus for successively transferring the image of a pattern to be formed on a reticle used as a photomask through a projection optical system onto shot regions on a wafer (photosensitive substrate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the figure, an ultraviolet pulse light IL constituting the light from the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (here, assumed to be an ArF excimer laser (wavelength 193 nm) passes through a beam matching unit (BMU) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> including movable mirrors etc. for positioning the light path with the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A then passes through a pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to impinge the variable light attenuator constituting a light attenuator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for controlling the amount of exposure of the resist on the wafer W communicates with the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to control the starting and stopping of light emission and the output as determined by the oscillation frequency and the pulse energy and to adjust, step by step or continuously, the rate of light attenuation on the ultraviolet pulse light IL in the variable light attenuator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Note that as the illumination light, light other than an ArF excimer laser of a wavelength 193 nm, for example, light of a KrF excimer laser (wavelength 248 nm), F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser (wavelength 157 nm), Ar<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>excimer laser (wavelength 126 nm), and other vacuum ultraviolet light of a wavelength of 200 nm or so or ultraviolet light higher than that can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The light IL passing through the variable light attenuator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> passes through a beam shaping optical system comprised of lens systems <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> arranged along a predetermined optical axis and impinges on an optical integrator (lot integrator or fly-eye lens etc., in the figure, a fly-eye lens) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Note that two fly-eye lenses <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be provided in series to improve the illumination uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An aperture system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is arranged at the emission face of the fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The aperture system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is arranged to enable a circular aperture for normal illumination, an aperture for modified illumination comprised of a plurality of small off-center openings, an aperture for ring-type illumination, etc. to be switched between. The light IL emitted from the fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and passed through a predetermined aperture of the aperture system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> strikes the high transmittance, low reflectance beam splitter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The light reflected at the beam splitter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> strikes an integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprised of a photoelectric detector. The detection signal of the integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is supplied to the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The transmittance and reflectance of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are measured in advance to a high precision and stored in a memory of the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured to be able to indirectly monitor the amount of light IL striking the projection optical system PL by the detection signal of the integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The light IL passing through the beam splitter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> travels via a reflection mirror <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and condenser lens system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to strike a fixed illumination field aperture (fixed blind) in a reticle blind mechanism <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The fixed blind <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a straight slit shape or rectangular shaped opening arranged to extend in a direction perpendicular to the direction of scan exposure at the center of the circular field of the projection optical system PL. Further, inside the reticle blind mechanism <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided a movable blind <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for changing the width of the illumination field area in the direction of scan exposure separate from the fixed blind <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Information of the opening rate of the movable blind <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is supplied to the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as well. The value of the amount of incident light found from the detection signal of the integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> multiplied by the opening rate is the actual amount of light incident on the projection optical system PL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The ultraviolet pulse light IL shaped to a slit by the fixed blind <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the reticle blind mechanism <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> travels via an imaging lens system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, reflection mirror <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and main condenser lens system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to illuminate an illumination field resembling the slit-like opening of the fixed blind <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the circuit pattern field of the reticle R by a uniform intensity. That is, the surface of the fixed blind <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or movable blind <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> where the opening is located substantially also constitutes the pattern surface of the reticle R due to the composite system of the imaging lens system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and main condenser lens system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Under the ultraviolet pulse light IL, the image of the circuit pattern in the illumination field of the reticle R is transferred through the double-sided telecentric projection system PL to the slit-shaped exposure field of the resist layer on the wafer W arranged at the imaging plane of the projection optical system PL by a predetermined projection magnification rate &bgr; (&bgr; is for example &frac14;, &frac15;, etc.) This exposure field is located on one shot region among the plurality of shot regions on the wafer W. Below, the explanation will be given setting the Z-axis parallel to the optical axis AX of the projection optical system PL, the X-axis in the scan direction in the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis (direction parallel to surface of paper of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and the Y-axis the non-scan direction orthogonal to the scan direction (direction perpendicular to surface of paper of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> At this time, the reticle R is held by suction by a reticle holder (not shown) at areas near its two sides. The reticle holder is carried on a reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> through a plurality of extendable drive elements. The reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is carried on a reticle base <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to be able to move at an equal speed in the X-direction and so as to be able to be moved finely in the X-direction, Y-direction, and direction of rotation. The two-dimension position and angle of rotation of the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (reticle R) are measured in real time by a laser interferometer in a drive control unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Based on the measured results and control information from a main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprised of a computer in overall control of the operation of the apparatus as a whole, a drive motor (linear motor or voice coil motor etc.) in the drive control unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> controls the scan velocity and position of the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When aligning the reticle, the center of a pair of reticle alignment marks (not shown) formed on the reticle R is set to about the center of the exposure field of the projection optical system PL. In that state, the reticle alignment marks are illuminated by illumination light of the same wavelength as the illumination light IL. The images of the reticle alignment marks are formed near alignment marks (not shown) on the wafer stage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. By detecting the amount of offset of an alignment mark on the wafer stage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> with respect to the image of a reticle alignment mark by a reticle alignment microscope (not shown) and positioning the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to correct this offset, the reticle can be positioned with respect to the wafer W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At this time, by observing a corresponding reference mark by an alignment sensor (not shown), the interval (base line amount) from the center of detection of the alignment sensor to the center of the pattern image of the reticle R is calculated. When performing overlay exposure on the wafer W, the wafer stage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is driven based on the position obtained by correcting the results of detection by the alignment sensor by that baseline amount thereby enabling transfer of the pattern image of the reticle R to the shot regions on the wafer W with a high overlay accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the wafer W is held by suction by the wafer holder WH and placed on to the Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.The Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fixed on an XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> moving two-dimensionally along an XY-plane parallel to the image plane of the projection optical system PL. The wafer stage <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is comprised by the Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> brings the surface of the wafer W into register with the image plane of the projection optical system PL by an auto focus system and auto leveling system, while the XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> performs an equal speed scan in the X-direction of the wafer W and stepping in the X-direction and Y-direction. The two-dimensional position and angle of rotation of the Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (wafer W) are measured in real time by a laser interferometer in a drive control unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Based on the measurement results and control information from the main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a drive motor (linear motor etc.) in the drive control unit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> controls the scan velocity and position of the XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The rotational error of the wafer W is corrected by rotating the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> through the main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and drive control unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> sends the movement position, movement velocity, movement acceleration, positional offset, and other various information for the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to the drive control units <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. At the time of scan-exposure, the reticle R is made to scan the illumination field of the ultraviolet pulse light IL through the reticle stage <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the &plus;X-direction (or &minus;X-direction) at a velocity Vr and, synchronously with this, the wafer W is made to scan the exposure field of the pattern image of the reticle R through the XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> in the &minus;X-direction (or &plus;X-direction) at a velocity &bgr;&middot;Vr (&bgr; is the projection magnification rate from the reticle R to the wafer W). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Further, the main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> sets various exposure conditions for scan exposure of the resist of the shot regions on the wafer W by a suitable amount of exposure and executes the most suitable exposure sequence linked with the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That is, when an instruction for starting scan exposure of one shot region on the wafer W is issued from the main control system <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> starts the emission of illumination light by the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and finds the amount of light incident on the projection optical system PL based on the detection signal of the integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Further, the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls the output of the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (oscillation frequency and pulse energy) and the light attenuation rate of the variable light attenuator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> based on the amount of incident light and transmittance of the projection optical system PL so as to obtain a suitable amount of exposure at all points of the resist on the wafer W after scan exposure. When finishing the scan exposure of the shot regions, the emission of illumination light by the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Further, an illumination amount monitor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> comprised of a photoelectric detector is provided near the wafer holder WH of the Z-tilt stage <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in this embodiment. The detection signal of the illumination amount monitor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is also supplied to the exposure controller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The illumination amount monitor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is provided with a light receiving face of a size covering the entirety of the exposure field by the projection optical system PL. By driving the XY-stage <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to set the light receiving face at a position covering the exposure field of the projection optical system PL, the amount of ultraviolet pulse light IL passing through the projection optical system PL can be measured. In this embodiment, the detection signals of the integrator sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the illumination amount monitor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are used to measure the transmittance of the projection optical system PL. Note that instead of the illumination amount monitor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, it is possible to use an illumination uniformity sensor having a pinhole shaped light receiving part for measuring the distribution of light in the exposure field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since the illumination light used is ArF excimer laser light, a subchamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided for shielding the light path from the pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the variable light attenuator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, lens systems <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and fly-eye lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to main condenser lens system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from the outside air. The inside of the subchamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is supplied with an inert gas (nitrogen, helium, etc.) through a pipe <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the entirety of the space inside the barrel of the projection optical system PL (space between plurality of lens elements) is supplied with an inert gas through a pipe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The inert gas does not have to be supplied that often once the atmospheric air is completely replaced by it if the subchamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or barrel of the projection optical system PL is highly air-tight. Considering the fluctuations in transmittance caused by deposition of water molecules, hydrocarbon molecules, etc. caused from the various substances in the light path (glass, coatings, adhesives, paint, metals, ceramics, etc.) on the surfaces of the optical elements, however, it is necessary to provide a forced flow of temperature-controlled inert gas in the light path and use a chemical filter or electrostatic filter to remove these impurity molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Note that the above exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D were made step-and-scan type reduction projection type exposure apparatuses (scanning steppers), but they may also be step-and-repeat type reduction projection type exposure apparatuses (steppers) which emit exposure use illumination light over the entire reticle pattern in a state with the reticle and wafer held stationary and expose one region (shot region) on the wafer on which the reticle pattern is to be transferred all at once or other types of exposure apparatuses. Further, the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D do not have to be the same types of exposure apparatuses as each other. They may be mixtures of scan types, stationary types, and other types. Further, it is possible to mix exposure apparatuses differing in the sizes of the fieldsd on the substrate exposed by a single exposure operation without regard as to the above types (as one example, having different field sizes of the projection optical systems). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Further, the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D may not only be ones used for manufacture of semiconductor elements, liquid crystal displays, plasma displays, thin film magnetic heads, imaging elements (CCD etc.), and micromachines, but also ones for transferring circuit patterns on glass substrates or silicon wafers etc. for production of reticles or masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The microdevices are produced by the step of designing the functions and performance of the device, the step of fabricating a mask (reticle) based on the design step, a step of fabricating a wafer or glass plate (photosensitive substrate), a step of using the above exposure apparatus (exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D) to transfer the mask pattern to the substrate by exposure, a step of assembling the device (including a bonding process), and an inspection step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Illumination Apparatus&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given of an illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. The illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is comprised of a light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a plurality of mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D for switching the light paths, and a plurality of amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D and the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D are provided corresponding to the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, that is, one for each. One of each of the light source <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided for the exposure system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is, here, an excimer laser light source for outputting ArF excimer laser light of a wavelength of 193 nm. Note that in the following explanation, the light-emitted from-the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> but before amplification or before conversion of wavelength is sometimes referred to as the reference light. The light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D are connected optically by a light transmitter (not shown) comprised of a plurality of optical elements etc. including lens and mirrors. The amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, while not particularly limited to this, are provided near to the illumination optical systems of the corresponding exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D are arranged in the light paths formed by the light transmitter. The mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C are movable type total reflection mirrors able to selectively bend the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> toward the corresponding amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C or release the same. The reflection mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D is a total reflection mirror fixed constantly bending the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> toward the corresponding amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. The mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D may also however be a movable type like the mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C are selectively controlled in posture by the light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. That is, by setting the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to the bending position under the control of the light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted completely to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A corresponding to the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. On the other hand, by the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A being set to the release position, the transmission of the reference light to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> By having the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B set to the bending position in the state with the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A set to the release position, the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted completely to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B corresponding to the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. On the other hand, by having the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A set to the bending position or the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B set to the release position, the transmission of reference light to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> By having the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C set to the bending position in the state with the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A and the mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B set to the release position, the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted completely to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C corresponding to the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C.

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The reference light from the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> passes through the window of the reflection mirror <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and is introduced into the laser tube <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and amplified.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> An excimer laser amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of such an unstable resonator configuration has the feature of a large amplification rate, but when that large an amplification rate is not required, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is also possible to configure it by just the laser tube <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> without use of the reflection mirror <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> or output mirror <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. By doing this, the configuration can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As explained above, in the first embodiment, the reference light from a single light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) is selectively sent to one of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D (excimer laser amplifiers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) provided corresponding to the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D by a light path switch comprised of the light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D and amplified to a predetermined power by the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D to be supplied to the corresponding exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D for exposure work.

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Note that in this embodiment, since the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) used is one emitting pulse light such as an excimer laser, a synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used for synchronization of the oscillation timing with the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D (excimer laser amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) selected by the light path switching controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D, but it is also possible to use a continuous light source as the light source.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Note that when restricting the incidence of light on those of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D not performing exposure work at the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side, it is possible to provide shutters (not shown) in the light paths, for example, between the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D and the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D and selectively operate them.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the difference from the second embodiment explained above lies in the point of providing wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D in the light paths between the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D and the corresponding amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, as the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> constituting the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, use is made of an Ar ion gas laser, that is, one generating reference light of a wavelength of 496.5 nm. As the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D, ones converting the light to a wavelength to the second harmonic of the Ar ion gas laser, that is, a wavelength of 248.25 nm (light of wavelength corresponding to KrF excimer laser) are used. As the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, KrF excimer amplifiers (<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) are used. As the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D, non-linear optical crystals are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The Ar ion gas laser (reference light) from the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is sent to the light transmitter having the distributor provided with the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and is incident to the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> An Ar ion gas laser is a continuous light source, so there is no need for any synchronization in the timing of discharge among the laser tubes <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. Therefore, in the third embodiment, no synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as in the first embodiment and second embodiment described above is provided. When the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a pulse light source such as an excimer laser light source, however, the synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Further, when using ArF excimer laser amplifiers (wavelength 193 nm) as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, it is possible to use a titanium sapphire laser oscillator as the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the light source and convert the reference light to light of a wavelength corresponding to an ArF excimer laser by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D or use a semiconductor laser oscillator of a wavelength of 772 nm and convert the wavelength of the light to a fourth harmonic corresponding to an ArF excimer laser as a fourth harmonic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Note that in the third embodiment, after the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is converted by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D to the wavelength of the illumination light which the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D use for exposure work, the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D are used to amplify the light to powers determined by the specifications of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, but it is also possible to first amplify the light by the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D and then convert the wavelength by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D. At this time, optical fiber amplifiers may also be used as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A-to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D or the-wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D may be placed in the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, for example, may be provided on the same frame as at least part of the illumination optical systems (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is possible to use a DFB semiconductor laser or fiber laser (for example, yttrium-doped fiber laser) as the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, use erbium(or erbium- and yttrium-) doped fiber amplifiers as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, amplify the infrared region or visible region single wavelength laser emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the fiber amplifiers, and then use the high harmonics obtained by using non-linear optical crystals to convert the wavelength to ultraviolet light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> For example, if the oscillation wavelength of the single wavelength laser is made a range of 1.51 to 1.59 m, the eighth harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 189 to 199 nm or the 10th harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 151 to 159 nm is output. In particular, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.544 to 1.553 &mgr;m, the eighth harmonic of a range of 193 to 194 nm, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an ArF excimer laser, is obtained, while if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.57 to 1.58 &mgr;m, the 10th harmonic of a range of 157 to 158 nm, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Further, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.03 to 1.12 &mgr;m, the seventh harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 147 to 160 nm is output. In particular, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.099 to 1.106 &mgr;m, the seventh harmonic of an oscillation wavelength of a range of 157 to 158 nm, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Note that it is also possible to mix together movable total reflection mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>C as in the second embodiment explained above and fixed type mirrors (beam splitters) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D as in the third embodiment explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a view of the general configuration of a fourth embodiment of the present invention, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows key parts of the same. Constituent parts substantially the same as the first to third embodiments explained above are assigned the same reference numerals and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment differs from the third embodiment explained above in that the optical connection between the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D is achieved not by a light transmitter including mirrors such as the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D, but by a light transmitter including optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D. Note that in the figures, L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D are collimator lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, use is made of an Ar ion gas laser, that is, one generating reference light of a wavelength of 496.5 nm. As the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D, ones converting the light to a wavelength of the second harmonics of the Ar ion gas laser, that is, a wavelength of 248.25 nm (light of wavelength corresponding to KrF excimer laser) are used. As the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, KrF excimer amplifiers <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are used. These points are similar to the third embodiment explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The Ar ion gas laser (reference light) from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) is sent by the collimator lens L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D, and collimator lenses L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D and impinge on the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D. In the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D, the incident reference light is converted to the wavelength of the light which the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D use for the exposure work (wavelength 248.25 nm), amplified by the corresponding amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D (KrF excimer laser amplifiers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>), and sent to the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. Note that the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the corresponding amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D are optically connected by a light transmitter provided with reflection mirrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> An Ar ion gas laser is a continuous light source, so there is no need for any synchronization in the timing of discharge among the laser tubes <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. Therefore, in the fourth embodiment as well, no synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as in the first embodiment and second embodiment described above is provided. When the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a pulse light source such as an excimer laser light source, however, the synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Further, when using ArF excimer laser amplifiers (wavelength 193 nm) as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, it is possible to use a titanium sapphire laser oscillator as the reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the light source and convert the reference light to light of a wavelength corresponding to an ArF excimer laser by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D or use a semiconductor laser oscillator of a wavelength of 772 nm and convert the light to a wavelength corresponding to an ArF excimer laser as a fourth harmonic in the same way as the above third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> With normal optical fiber cables using quartz etc., transmission of short wavelength light like that of a KrF excimer laser (wavelength 248 nm) or ArF excimer (wavelength 193 nm) is generally not possible due to the large loss, but in the fourth embodiment explained above, this can be dealt with by using a light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> emitting light of a relatively long wavelength (for example, a wavelength of 496.5 nm) able to sent over the optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D and converting the wavelength near the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D to that of the short wavelength light which the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D use for exposure work (here, light of a wavelength corresponding to that of a KrF excimer laser light). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since the wavelength is relatively long, light can be transmitted from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D by the optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D. Due to this, adjustment of alignment etc. between the mirrors and other optical elements becomes easy, the positional misalignment among optical elements can be reduced, and the loss of light can be reduced. By using the optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D, the freedom of layout of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D can also be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> When using the fibers closer to the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D side than the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D, the fibers may for example be made of fluorine-doped synthetic quartz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Note that in the fourth embodiment, after the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is converted by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D to the wavelength of the illumination light which the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D use for exposure work, the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D are used to amplify the light to powers determined by the specifications of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, but it is also possible to first amplify the light by the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D and then convert the wavelength by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D in the same way as in the third embodiment. At this time, optical fiber amplifiers may also be used as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D or the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D may be placed in the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. Further, when the wavelength of the exposure illumination light used by one or more of the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D is less than 200 nm, the light paths between the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D and the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D are preferably purged by a gas having a relatively high transmittance with respect to the illumination light (nitrogen, helium, etc.) However, the wavelength of the light transmitted between the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D is relatively long and there is no need to purge the light paths, so the configuration can be simplified. This is particularly effective when arranging the wavelength converters closer to the exposure unit side than the amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is possible to use a DFB semiconductor laser or fiber laser (for example, yttrium-doped fiber laser) as the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, use erbium(or erbium- and yttrium-) doped fiber amplifiers as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, connect these by optical fibers, transmit the infrared region or visible region single wavelength laser emitted from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the fiber amplifiers, amplify it there, and then use the high harmonic obtained by using non-linear optical crystals to convert the wavelength to ultraviolet light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> For example, if the oscillation wavelength of the single wavelength laser is made a range of 1.51 to 1.59 &mgr;m, the eighth harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 189 to 199 nm or the 10th harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 151 to 159 nm is output. In particular, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.544 to 1.553 &mgr;m, the eighth harmonic of a range of 193 to 194 nm, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an ArF excimer laser, is obtained, while if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.57 to 1.58 &mgr;m, the 10th harmonic of a range of 157 to 158 nm, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Further, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.03 to 1.12 &mgr;m, the seventh harmonic having an oscillation wavelength of 147 to 160 nm is output. In particular, if the oscillation wavelength is made a range of 1.099 to 1.106 &mgr;m, the seventh harmonic of an oscillation wavelength of a range of 157 to 158 &mgr;m, that is, ultraviolet light of substantially the same wavelength as an F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Note that it is also possible to provide shutters (not shown) in the light paths, for example, between the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D and the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D and selectively restrict the light to the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Fifth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a view of the general configuration of a fifth embodiment of the present invention. Constituent parts substantially the same as the first to fourth embodiments explained above are assigned the same reference numerals and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The fifth embodiment is a combination of the first embodiment and fourth embodiment. The light is transmitted by a light transmitter having a light path switch including a light path switch controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D, then transmitted to the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D by a light_transmitter having optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Note that in the figure, a synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided for synchronization of oscillation between the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, but when the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not a pulse light source, but a continuous light source, the synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not needed as already explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Further, it is similarly also possible to provide shutters (not shown) in the light paths, for example, between the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D and the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D and selectively restrict the light to the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. Note that in this embodiment, the modifications explained with reference to the fourth embodiment may also be applied in whole or in part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Sixth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a view of the general configuration of a sixth embodiment of the present invention. Constituent parts substantially the same as the first to fifth embodiments explained above are assigned the same reference numerals and explanations thereof are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The sixth embodiment is an exposure system comprised of a single master exposure apparatus (master apparatus) MA and-a plurality of slave exposure apparatuses (slave apparatuses) SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . The master exposure apparatus MA can perform exposure work on its own, while the slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . are able to be added in accordance with need (when increasing the production capacity). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The master apparatus MA is comprised by a light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a reference laser oscillator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for emitting excimer laser light (reference light), an amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A having an excimer laser amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a light transmitter for optically connecting the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A, a synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for synchronizing oscillation between the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A, and an exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A for performing exposure work using the light amplified by the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A. The slave apparatus SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is comprised by an amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B having an excimer laser amplifier <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a light transmitter for optically connecting the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the master exposure apparatus MA and the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B, and an exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B for performing exposure work using the light amplified by the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B. The slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . are basically configured the same as the slave apparatus SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> When the master exposure apparatus MA is provided alone, the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A by the light transmitter. There, it is amplified while synchronized by the synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and strikes the exposure unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A for use in exposure work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Increases in the production capacity can be met by additionally installing the slave exposure apparatus SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, a mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A serving as a splitter for the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (in this case, a beam splitter with a 50 percent reflectance) is provided in the light path of the light transmitter of the master exposure apparatus MA. The reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is distributed to the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B through a mirror (in this case, a total reflection mirror) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B of the light transmitter of the slave exposure apparatus SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, work is performed for connecting the synchronizer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the amplifier <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B by control wires. The same applies when adding the slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Note that the splitter (mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A etc.) of the master exposure apparatus MA need not be provided in the master exposure apparatus MA in advance. It may also be added when additionally installing the slave exposure apparatus SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> etc. The splitter (mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A etc.) may also be provided in the master exposure apparatus MA in advance and disabled in function when no slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> etc. are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> According to the sixth embodiment, since it is possible to provide a master exposure apparatus MA provided with a single light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> alone first and then add a plurality of slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . all together or successively in accordance with need, it is possible to flexibly deal with desired increases in production capacity. Further, since the additional slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc. do not have light sources, they become cheaper by at least that amount and the overall system can be reduced in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Note that as the splitter, it is possible to use one which selectively splits light such as the light path switch controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and mirrors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or one which equally or unequally distributes light such as the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Further, it is possible to provide a wavelength converter <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> in the master exposure apparatus MA, provide wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B in the slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc., and convert the wavelength of the reference light from the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B to the wavelength of the light which the exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B use for exposure work. In this case, it is possible to use optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D (including-lenses L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D, etc.) such as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> to optically connect the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the master exposure apparatus MA and the slave exposure apparatuses SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D may be provided either inside or outside of the chambers of the corresponding exposure units <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D (boxes covering exposure units as a whole). When providing the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D inside the chambers, for example it is possible to provide them integrally with the frames supporting the illumination optical systems. Further, the wavelength converters <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D may be also provided inside the exposure units (chambers) along with the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D or alone. Note that as the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D, optical fiber amplifiers may also be used. At this time, the amplifiers are preferably arranged to the light source side from the wavelength converters. Further, in this case, the main parts of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D may be arranged inside the chambers, while the other parts, for example, the power sources, may be arranged outside the chambers. Also, the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be provided under the floor of the clean room (utility space). Further, as the optical fiber cables <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>D, the lenses L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>A to L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>D, L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D, etc., ones formed by fluorine-doped synthetic quartz may be used. In particular, these are-effective for exposure light of a wavelength of 120 nm to 180 nm. </paragraph>
