<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to room temperature voltage tunable varactors and tunable devices that include such varactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Phased array antennas are comprised of a large number of elements that emit phase controlled signals to form a radio beam. The radio signal can be electronically steered by the active manipulation of the relative phasing of the individual antenna elements. This electronic beam steering concept applies to both transmitters and receivers. Phased array antennas are advantageous in comparison to their mechanical counterparts with respect to their speed, accuracy, and reliability. The replacement of gimbal scanned antennas by their electronically scanned counterpart can provide more rapid and accurate target identification. Complex tracking exercises can also be performed rapidly and accurately with a phased array antenna system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Adjustable phase shifters are used to steer the beam in phased array antennas. Previous patents in this area include ferroelectric phase shifters in U.S. Pat. No.: 5,307,033, 5,032,805, and 5,561,407. These phase shifters include one or more microstrip lines on a ferroelectric substrate as the phase modulate elements. The permittivity of the ferroelectric substrate may be varied by varying the strength of an electric field on the substrate. Tuning of the permittivity of the substrate results in phase shifting when an RF signal passes through the microstrip line. The microstrip ferroelectric phase shifters disclosed in those patents suffer high conductor losses and impedance matching problems due to the high dielectric constant of the ferroelectric substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Future communications will employ wideband frequency-hopping techniques, so that large amount of digital data can be transferred over the band. A critical component for these applications is a low cost fast-acting tunable filter. Digital data could be distributed or encoded over a band of frequencies in a sequence determined by controlling circuitry of the tunable filter. This would allow several users to transmit and receive over a common range of frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Varactors can be used independently utilized or can be integrated into low cost tunable filters. These varactors and filters can be used at numerous frequency ranges, including frequencies above L-band, in a myriad of commercial and military applications. These applications include (a) L-band (1-2 GHz) tunable filters for wireless local area network systems, personal communications systems, and satellite communication systems, (b) C-band (4-6 GHz) varactors and tunable filter for frequency hopping for satellites communications and radar systems (c) X-20 band (9-12 GHz) varactors and filters for use in radar systems (d) K<highlight><subscript>u </subscript></highlight>band (12-18 GHz) for use in satellite television systems, and (e) K<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>band tunable filters for satellites communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Common varactors used today are Silicon and GaAs based diodes. The performance of these varactors is defined by the capacitance ratio, C<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>, frequency range and figure of merit, or Q factor (1/tan &dgr;) at the specified frequency range. The Q factors for these semiconductor varactors for frequencies up to 2 GHz are usually very good. However, at frequencies above 2 GHz, the Q factors of these varactors degrade rapidly. In fact, at 10 GHz the Q factors for these varactors are usually only about 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Varactors that utilize a thin film ferroelectric ceramic as a voltage tunable element in combination with a superconducting element have been described. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,042 discloses a thin film ferroelectric varactor having a carrier substrate layer, a high temperature superconducting layer deposited on the substrate, a thin film ferroelectric deposited on the metallic layer, and a plurality of metallic conductive means disposed on the thin film ferroelectric, which are placed in electrical contact with RF transmission lines in tuning devices. Another tunable capacitor using a ferroelectric element in combination with a superconducting element is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,194. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a need for varactors that can operate at temperatures above those necessary for superconduction and at frequencies up to 10 GHz and beyond, while maintaining high Q factors. In addition, there is a need for microwave devices that include such varactors. </paragraph>

One embodiment of such phase shifters includes a rat race coupler having an RF input and an RF output, first and second microstrips positioned on the rat race coupler, a first reflective termination positioned adjacent to an end of the first microstrip, and a second reflective termination positioned adjacent to an end of the second microstrip, wherein the first and second reflective terminations each includes one of the tunable varactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of such phase shifters includes a microstrip having an RF input and an RF output, first and second radial stubs extending from the microstrip, a first varactor positioned within the first radial stub, and a second varactor positioned within the second radial stub, wherein each of the first and second varactors is one of the above tunable varactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The planar ferroelectric varactors of the present invention can be used to produce a phase shift in various microwave devices, and in other devices such as tunable filters. The devices herein are unique in design and exhibit low insertion loss even at frequencies greater than 10 GHz. The devices utilize low loss tunable bulk or film dielectric elements.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are top and cross sectional views of a varactor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with this invention. The varactor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a generally planar top surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A tunable ferroelectric layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to the top surface of the substrate. A pair of metal electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are positioned on top of the ferroelectric layer. The substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a material having a relatively low permittivity such as MgO, Alumina, LaAlO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Sapphire, or a ceramic. For the purposes of this invention, a low permittivity is a permittivity of less than about 30. The tunable ferroelectric layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is comprised of a material having a permittivity in a range from about 20 to about 2000, and having a tunability in the range from about 10% to about 80% at a bias voltage of about 10 V/&mgr;m. In the preferred embodiment this layer is preferably comprised of Barium-Strontium Titanate, Ba<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>TiO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(BSTO), where x can range from zero to one, or BSTO-composite ceramics. Examples of such BSTO composites include, but are not limited to: BSTO-MgO, BSTO-MgAl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, BSTO-CaTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BSTO-MgTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BSTO-MgSrZrTiO<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, and combinations thereof. The tunable layer in one preferred embodiment has a dielectric permittivity greater than 100 when subjected to typical DC bias voltages, for example, voltages ranging from about 5 volts to about 300 volts. A gap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of width g, is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The gap width must be optimized to increase ratio of the maximum capacitance C<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>to the minimum capacitance C<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>(C<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>) and increase the quality facto (Q) of the device. The width of this gap has the most influence on the varactor parameters. The optimal width, g, will be determined by the width at which the device has maximum C<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>and minimal loss tangent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A controllable voltage source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected by lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This voltage source is used to supply a DC bias voltage to the ferroelectric layer, thereby controlling the permittivity of the layer. The varactor also includes an RF input <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an RF output <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The RF input and output are connected to electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, by soldered or bonded connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments, the varactors may use gap widths of less than 5-50 &mgr;m. The thickness of the ferroelectric layer ranges from about 0.1 &mgr;m to about 20 &mgr;m. A sealant <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned within the gap and can be any non-conducting material with a high dielectric breakdown strength to allow the application of high voltage without arcing across the gap. In the preferred embodiment, the sealant can be epoxy or polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The other dimension that strongly influences the design of the varactors is the length, L, of the gap as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The length of the gap L can be adjusted by changing the length of the ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the electrodes. Variations in the length have a strong effect on the capacitance of the varactor. The gap length will optimized for this parameter. Once the gap width has been selected, the capacitance becomes a linear function of the length L. For a desired capacitance, the length L can be determined experimentally, or through computer simulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the tunable ferroelectric layer also has a strong effect on the C<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>. The optimum thickness of the ferroelectric layers will be determined by the thickness at which the maximum C<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>occurs. The ferroelectric layer of the varactor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> can be comprised of a thin film, thick film, or bulk ferroelectric material such as Barium-Strontium Titanate, Ba<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>TiO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(BSTO), BSTO and various oxides, or a BSTO composite with various dopant materials added. All of these materials exhibit a low loss tangent. For the purposes of this description, for operation at frequencies ranging from about 1.0 GHz to about 10 GHz, the loss tangent would range from about 0.0001 to about 0.001. For operation at frequencies ranging from about 10 GHz to about 20 GHz, the loss tangent would range from about 0.001 to about 0.01. For operation at frequencies ranging from about 20 GHz to about 30 GHz, the loss tangent would range from about 0.005 to about 0.02. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The electrodes may be fabricated in any geometry or shape containing a gap of predetermined width. The required current for manipulation of the capacitance of the varactors disclosed in this invention is typically less than 1 &mgr;A. In the preferred embodiment, the electrode material is gold. However, other conductors such as copper, silver or aluminum, may also be used. Gold is resistant to corrosion and can be readily bonded to the RF input and output. Copper provides high conductivity, and would typically be coated with gold for bonding or nickel for soldering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show a voltage tunable planar varactor having a planar electrode with a predetermined gap distance on a single layer tunable bulk, thick film or thin film dielectric. The applied voltage produces an electric field across the gap of the tunable dielectric that produces an overall change in the capacitance of the varactor. The width of the gap can range from 5 to 50 &mgr;m depending on the performance requirements. The varactor can be in turn integrated into a myriad of tunable devices such as those commonly used in conjunction with semiconductor varactors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of voltage tunable dielectric varactors of this invention have Q factors ranging from about 50 to about 10,000 when operated at frequencies ranging from about 1 GHz to about 40 GHz. The capacitance (in pF) and the loss factor (tan &dgr;) of the varactors measured at 3, 10 and 20 GHz for gap distances of 10 and 20 &mgr;m are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Based on the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the Q&apos;s for the varactors are approximately the following: 200 at 3 GHz, 80 at 10 GHz, 45-55 at 20 GHz. In comparison, typical Q&apos;s for GaAs semiconductor diode varactors are as follows: 175 at 2 GHz, 35 at 10 GHz and much less at even higher frequency. Therefore at frequencies greater than or equal to 10 GHz the varactors of this invention have much better Q factors. </paragraph>

In this embodiment of the invention, an electrically tunable filter is achieved at room temperature by mounting several ferroelectric varactors on a fin line waveguide. The fin line construction is comprised of three foil copper plates <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> with thickness of 0.2 mm placed at the center of the waveguide <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> along its longitudinal axis. Two lateral plates with shorted end fin line resonators <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are grounded due to the contact with the waveguide. Central plate <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is insulated for DC voltage from the waveguide by mica <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and is used to apply the control voltage (U<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>) to the tunable dielectric varactors <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The tunable ferroelectric varactors are soldered in the end of the fin line resonators between plates <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and plates <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>.
