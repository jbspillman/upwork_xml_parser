<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> a. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a drive mechanism and a head rail for a blind, in particular to a drive mechanism and head rail allowing tilting and retraction of the blind slats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> b. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Previously, it was known to provide a vertical blind suspended from a head rail for covering an architectural opening. Each vertical slat is suspended from a carriage which is movable towards and away from one end of the head rail. Traditionally, some form of chain or cord extends in a loop along the length of the head rail so as to retract and deploy the carriages. Furthermore, a rotatable rod also extends the length of the head rail and rotation of the rod is transferred by the carriages so as to rotate the vertical slats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, the two operations of tilting and retraction are controlled by separate cords or chains hanging down from the head rail. However, EP-A-0467627 discloses a system by which both operations may be controlled by means of a single cord. In particular, a lost motion mechanism is provided between an input wheel driven by the control cord and drive to the retraction mechanism. Furthermore, slip is allowed to occur between the input control wheel and the tilt mechanism once the slats have reached their full tilt in either direction. In this way, movement of the control cord will first operate the tilt mechanism and then, once the slats have been fully tilted and the lost motion mechanism has come to the end of its travel, the slats are either retracted or deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has also been proposed to control blind movement by means of a motor, for instance in DE-U-9406083. However, this creates additional problems. The provision of two motors and associated control for the two slat operations is unduly bulky, heavy and expensive. Furthermore, the provision of a single motor with appropriate servo operation to direct power selectively to the two slat operations is also unduly complicated and expensive. With respect to the system of EP-A-0467627, it is undesirable to use a motor in conjunction with the slip mechanism provided for the tilt of slats, since the force required for slip needs to be carefully matched to the torque available from the motor. Indeed, even for manual cord operation, the slip mechanism is undesirable, because of the associated wear of its components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a head rail for a vertical blind, the head rail being elongate and having a mechanism at one end for selectively tilting and retracting slats of the vertical blind along the length of the head rail, the mechanism having a control gear, the rotation of which affects the selective tilting and retracting, wherein the control gear is located at a position along the length of the head rail so that it can be meshed with teeth of an external drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this way, the head rail may be constructed independently of any power source. A single head rail may be fitted with different power sources according to requirements. For instance, motor units may be provided which are operated remotely or by means of cords. Alternatively, a manually operated mechanism, for instance with cords, may be provided as the drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Similarly, different types and lengths of head rail may be provided and all be useable with the same drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the head rail includes a housing forming a generally enclosed structure, the housing including an aperture by which the control gear may mesh with the teeth of an external drive source. In this respect, the control gear can be rotatable about an axis parallel to the extent of the head rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this way, an aesthetically pleasing head rail may be provided. In particular, the head rail can include a housing to conceal all of the various operating parts of the head rail. However, by providing an aperture for the control gear, the head rail can still be operated by an external drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the aperture is located in the housing such that it is generally not visible in use. In this respect, the housing can have an elongate surface from which the slats may extend, for instance a lower surface, and at least one other parallel elongate surface, for instance a back surface, in which the aperture is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably the mechanism has another control gear, the rotation of which affects the selective tilting and retracting, the housing has another parallel elongate surface in which another aperture is formed by which the control gear may be operated by the teeth of an external drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The same control gear may be meshed with the teeth of the external drive source, or the mechanism may have another control gear as part of a gear train which affects the selective tilting and retracting. In this case, the another control gear may mesh with the teeth of the external drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this way, flexibility is provided in the way in which the external drive source may be mounted to the head rail. In particular, the second aperture and control gear may be provided towards the upper surface of the head rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is also provided a head rail as described above in combination with a motor unit for attachment to the at least one other parallel elongate surface of the head rail, the motor unit having a toothed drive gear for meshing with the control gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the motor unit is a generally elongate structure having an elongate attachment surface for mounting alongside the at least one other parallel elongate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A latch and clip arrangement may be provided as defined in the appended claims for attaching the motor unit to the head rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is also provided a drive mechanism for a blind having an array of retractable and tiltable slats, the mechanism including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a rotatable tilt drive for tilting slats; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> a rotatable retract drive for retracting and deploying slats; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> a transmission for rotating the tilt drive and the retract drive by means of a single rotatable source; wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> the transmission includes a clutch for rotating the tilt drive, the clutch incorporating a first lost motion mechanism whereby, after a predetermined number of rotations in the same direction, transmission by the clutch to the tilt drive is disengaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this way, both the tilt and retract operations of a blind may be controlled from a single rotatable source. Furthermore, by means of the lost motion mechanism and clutch, drive to the tilt mechanism is completely disengaged during drive of the retract mechanism. Hence, undue load on the drive source is avoided, together with wear of any components which were required to slip according to previous arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism is particularly advantageous in conjunction with the head rail defined above, since it provides the single control gear for operation by a drive source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the clutch comprises a cylindrical drive surface to be driven by the single rotatable source and a wrap spring such as a coil spring arranged to grip the drive surface, the wrap spring having radially extending ends for rotating the tilt drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The lost motion mechanism can include respective wrap spring release surfaces adjacent the ends of the wrap spring such that, when the wrap spring release surfaces are prevented from rotating and an end of the wrap spring rotates into abutment with a respective one of the wrap spring release surfaces, the wrap spring is resiliently deformed so as to release the grip on the drive surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this way, transmission from the rotatable source to the tilt drive passes through the wrap spring and by using the wrap spring release surfaces to deform the wrap spring, drive to the wrap spring from the drive surface is disengaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the tilt drive includes respective tilt surfaces adjacent the ends of the wrap spring such that, when an end of the wrap spring is rotated into abutment with a respective tilt surface, the grip of the wrap spring on the drive surface is tightened and the tilt drive is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this way, the wrap spring passes drive from the drive surface to the tilt surfaces so as to rotate the tilt drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the wrap spring surrounds the drive surface and the ends of the wrap spring extend radially outwardly. The wrap spring release surfaces and tilt surfaces are then formed on the edges of components extending axially around the outer periphery of the wrap spring and adjacent its ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The lost motion mechanism may include a series of co-axial wheels each constrained to be rotatable relative to an adjacent wheel through only a limited extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Alternative lost motion mechanisms may also be provided so as to allow only a limited amount of rotation of the wrap spring release surfaces. Indeed, according to the present invention, there may be provided a lost motion mechanism comprising first and second components relatively rotatable about a common axis; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> a spacer disposed between the first and second components; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> a flexible elongate member having ends attached respectively to the first and second components wherein relative rotation of the first and second components causes the flexible elongate member to wrap around the spacer such that the first and second components can rotate relative to one another by an amount determined by the length of the flexible elongate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The first lost motion mechanism may be such a lost motion mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the retract drive is rotated by the transmission by means of a second or retract lost motion mechanism such that the retract drive is only rotated after a predetermined number of rotations of the transmission in the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this way, the retract drive is not operated during initial operation of the tilt drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the retract lost motion mechanism has a greater extent of lost motion than the tilt lost motion mechanism such that transmission to the tilt drive is disengaged before transmission is provided to the retract drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In this way, slats of the blind may be fully tilted and their drive disengaged before any retraction or deployment starts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The second lost motion mechanism may comprise first and second components relatively rotatable about a common axis; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> a spacer disposed between the first and second components; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> a flexible elongate member having ends attached respectively to the first and second components wherein relative rotation of the first and second components causes the flexible elongate member to wrap around the spacer such that the first and second components can rotate relative to one another by an amount determined by the length of the flexible elongate member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a drive mechanism for a blind comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> an output gear rotatable relative to a housing for at least one of moving and tilting blind slats; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> a planet gear mating with the output gear; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> an input drive rotatable by a user for moving the planet gear in a circular path around the output gear; wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> the planet gear is restrained to limited rotation relative to the housing such that rotation of the input drive causes rotation of the output gear, but the output gear is unable to transmit drive back through to the input drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this way, a user may provide drive to move or tilt the blind slats such that the blind slats will remain securely in the position in which they are left. In particular, the weight of the blind slats or any attempt to move them will cause the drive mechanism to lock up, thereby preventing any motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferably, this drive mechanism may be used in conjunction with the mechanisms described above in respect of one or both of the tilt and retract operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description, given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) there is illustrated an end section of a head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an associated motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, together forming a head rail assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Within the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are preferably housed a number of carriages (not illustrated) each for suspending a vertical blind (also not illustrated). A tilt rod <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends along the length of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and passes through each of the carriages. By rotating the tilt rod <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the suspended vertical blinds may be tilted. A retraction chain <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> also extends up and down the length of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. By moving the chain <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the carriages may be deployed along or retracted from the length of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided as a separate integral unit. The motor unit is provided with an aperture <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through which a toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends. As will be described below, the end of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with a corresponding aperture allowing the toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to mesh with a control gear in the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In order to attach the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, there is provided a clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises a non-circular head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which may be inserted through a corresponding non-circular opening <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), where <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is the cross-section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> By rotating the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the non-circular head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), where <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a cross-section corresponding to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holds the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in place alongside the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Preferably, although not illustrated, the head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also extends rearwardly towards the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that, as it is rotated to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), it provides pressure on the inside of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby gripping the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> closely to the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Preferably, as illustrated, the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also provided with a handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which takes a concealed position between the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in the position holding the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be mounted to the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in any suitable manner allowing rotation. However, as illustrated in the figures, the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a generally circular head <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is rotationally mounted in the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is constructed having a lipped channel section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> along one side. Hence, preferably, the head <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fitted into the channel section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this way, the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> but is allowed freely to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be provided with a detent protrusion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which fits into the channel section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In particular, when the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are rotated to the locked position, the detent protrusion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> moves into the channel section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to hold the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a plate section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a tongue <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with an elongate groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into which the tongue <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be fitted. The clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> then has a latch (not illustrated) similar to latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In particular, on a down turned section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the plate section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a rotatable shaft is provided with a non-circular head. The non-circular head may be inserted into the lipped channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and then rotated so as to lie behind the lips of the channel and secure the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in place. As with the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the clip latch is preferably provided with a head which tightens on to the lips as it is rotated. As illustrated, a handle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided for rotating the clip latch and, as with the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is concealed between the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> when the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is secured to the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The handle may also include a detent protrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) also includes an elongate groove <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> opposite the elongate groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In this way, the plate section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may have an in-turned section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to resiliently fit into the elongate groove <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and hence, together with the down turned section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and elongate groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, more securely grip the housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Starting from the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned over the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that its tongue <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> grips the groove <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is then brought along side the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is inserted through the aperture <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the head of the clip latch is inserted into the lipped channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In this position, the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may still be moved along the length of the motor unit and head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Preferably, it is positioned so as best to support the weight of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The handles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are then rotated so as to secure the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in place. The latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holds the end of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjacent the end of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in engagement. Furthermore, the weight of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supported by the plate section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the top of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the tongue <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preventing the clip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> slipping around the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrate an alternative arrangement for the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In particular, in this arrangement, the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is mounted above the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along a different side of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to that illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be identical to that used with the arrangement of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In particular, it also includes the rotatable latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differs from that of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) only by the end cap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. In particular, the end cap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) includes a non-circular opening <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> through which the non-circular head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be inserted. This is illustrated in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) which shows the cross-section V-V of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As with the previous arrangement, by rotating the handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be locked in place against the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) which is a cross-section corresponding to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The end cap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> also includes an aperture <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through which the toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may mesh with a control gear of the head rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As with the previous arrangement, a clip is also provided to attach the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the clip <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has down turned sections <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> either side of the plate section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The down turned sections <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> fit into the elongate grooves <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> so as to secure the clip to the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, an insert <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is provided to fit into the channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a screw <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> provided to attach the plate section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the insert <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which is the cross-section VI-VI of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Considering <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the motor unit includes a first end assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a second end assembly <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The first end assembly in the illustrated embodiment includes a connector for receiving power and control signals if appropriate for remote control. The illustrated embodiment also includes two tongues <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for receiving a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The second end assembly <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a gearing support structure <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in which a main motor gear <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are housed. The motor gear <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and meshes with the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A cap <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be screwed to the support structure <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to enclose the gears <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and provide and end surface to the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates the provision of an insert <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which may be fixed in the lipped channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so as to prevent the head <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moving longitudinally along the lip channel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The support structure <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be provided with means to prevent the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moving in the opposite direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Behind the end cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, there may be provided a drive mechanism as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism incorporates a tilt drive for rotating the rod <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a retract drive for rotating the chain <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In particular, a tilt drive gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> rotates a tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> connected to the rod <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> rotates a retract drive including a chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> meshing with gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided in a single gear train by both meshing with an intermediate gear <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In this way, any of the tilt gear, retract gear and intermediate gear may be driven by some drive source, for instance the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described above, in order to operate both the tilt mechanism and the retract mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Tongues <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> can be provided to hold the last carriage, in other words the last vane carrier/traveller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Considering first the tilt mechanism, drive from the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided to the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by means of a transmission comprising a lost motion mechanism and a clutch mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with a shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having, at its end, a non-circular cross-section end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, in this case square. A clutch drive component <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> having an outer cylindrical drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fitted onto the non-circular cross-section end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be provided as an integral part of the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. However, by providing it as a separate component, the material properties of the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be chosen independently of those required for the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is fitted around the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> such that it lightly grips the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The drive component <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are then inserted within the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, particularly with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes an end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is of a part cylindrical shape. In particular, the part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> surrounds the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and has tilt surfaces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> adjacent the ends <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent, when the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and, hence, the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are rotated, the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will also be rotated due to its frictional engagement with the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In either direction of rotation, an end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will abut a tilt surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The wrap spring is wound and positioned within the part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> such that rotation of an end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> against a tilt surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> will tend to tighten the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> onto the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the frictional grip between the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this way, the end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will rotate the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The lost motion mechanism comprises a series of wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> arranged around the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Each wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has some form of protuberance or indent which allows it only to rotate to a limited extent with regard to an adjacent wheel. To reduce the number of wheels required, it is preferred that the available rotation should be as close to 360&deg; as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrate respectively the front and rear sides of a wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, each wheel includes a pair of protuberances <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on each side. In particular, at the outer periphery protuberances <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are provided in each axial direction and, at the inner periphery, protuberances <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are provided in each axial direction. Furthermore, on the rear side of each lost motion wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an annular supporting ridge <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is provided between the protuberances <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated, the annular supporting ridge <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> acts as a guide for the protuberances <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of an adjacent lost motion wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and assists in maintaining the lost motion wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in axial alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that, in order to provide the lost motion mechanism, it is not necessary to provide two protuberances on each side of a wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. However, the provision of two protuberances spreads the load between adjacent wheels, allows the transmitted torque to be shared between pairs of protuberances and prevents the wheels from becoming skew relative to the axis of the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In other words, they increase the abutment surface and thereby reduce/distribute the force on/over each protrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Although not illustrated, the first of the series of wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is either fixed to the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the mechanism or provided with a limited rotation relative to the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in the same way as to its adjacent wheel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As a result, the last wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the series of wheels can only rotate relative to the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> through a number of turns determined by the number and nature of the series of wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The last wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is provided with or attached to an extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> extends alongside the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> between its two ends <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. In particular, it extends into the gap left by the part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so as generally to complete the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that when the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are rotated, then the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and last wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will also be rotated. However, as mentioned above, due to the lost motion mechanism, the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and last wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can only rotate through a limited number of turns relative to the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Thus, once the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been rotated by its maximum number of turns, it will stop and an end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (the trailing end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which in the respective direction of rotation is not rotating the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) will abut a wrap spring release surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further rotation of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will cause the end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in contact with the wrap spring release surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be deflected. As will be appreciated, this deflection will open out the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and, hence, release the grip of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Thus, further rotation of the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will result merely in the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> slipping with respect to the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Hence, no further drive will be provided to the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Considering clockwise rotation of the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will first abut the tilt surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> so as to rotate the part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. At the same time the end <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> will abut the wrap spring release surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and rotate the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, when the lost motion mechanism reaches the end of its available motion, the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will not rotate any further. Hence, when the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> rotates, it will cause the end <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to be deflected against the wrap spring release surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As a result, grip between the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will be lost and no further rotation will be transmitted from the end <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to the tilt surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Thus, continuous drive to the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will only result in the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> being rotated through a predetermined number of turns. Once those predetermined number of turns have been made, the lost motion mechanism causes the clutch to release further drive. Hence, the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, even when continuously rotated, will only provide sufficient drive to tilt slats between their maximum tilt positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Similarly, modifications may be made to the clutch mechanism. For instance, by altering where the ends <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are positioned, it is possible that the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will make up the greater extent of the cylinder formed by the extension member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the part cylindrical end section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Also, the drive surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be an internal cylindrical surface with the ends <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the wrap spring <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extending inwardly to drive the tilt drive and be released by the lost motion mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Considering now the retract mechanism, a lost motion mechanism is provided between the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the retract drive <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, this retract lost motion mechanism comprises a series of wheels <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> similar to the wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> described above. Of course, as for the lost motion mechanism of the tilt drive, this retract lost motion mechanism can be constructed in other ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The first wheel <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the series of wheels is either attached to the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> or is restrained to rotate only to a limited extent relative to the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the last wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is attached to the gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or restrained to rotate only to a limited extent relative to the gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this respect, in the illustrated embodiment, the back of gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with protrusions, one of which <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is illustrated, to interact with the protrusions of the last wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In this way, rotation of the retract drive <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> only starts after a predetermined number of turns of the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided with a shaft <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> about which the lost motion wheels <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may rotate. Furthermore, the shaft <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is further provided with an internal cylindrical opening for receiving and supporting for rotation a shaft <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> With regard to the connection between the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, it is proposed to provide an overload clutch. In particular, the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> engages with the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in such a way that it will slip given sufficient force. As a result, any forcible movement of the blind or chain will cause the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to slip relative to the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> rather than cause damage to the drive mechanism. This will be described and illustrated further in the following embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative lost motion mechanism for the retract mechanism. This is illustrated in more detail in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Similar reference numerals as used in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the index denote functionally equivalent parts to those explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; has attached to it or integral with it a cylindrical spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. At the distal end of the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, there is an intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes a short pivot shaft <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> which pivots in a bearing aperture <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the end of the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is spaced from the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; and is able to rotate relative to the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; about the same axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A flexible elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> such as a thin cord or filament is attached to the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at one end <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The other end of the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is attached to the back surface of the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; or to the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> proximate the back surface of the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; is rotated, it first rotates relative to the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and wraps the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> around the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When all of the length of the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has been taken up around the periphery of the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the end <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> then pulls on the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> so as to rotate it. Upon rotation of the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; in the opposite direction, the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will rotate relative to the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and unwind the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from around the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Upon further rotation, it will then wrap the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> around the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction such that eventually the end <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will rotate the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in that opposite direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> If the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is attached to the back surface of the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; or to a component attached to or integral with the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;, then it is possible for the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be rotatable relative to the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;. The spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided merely for a surface about which the flexible elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be wrapped so as to take up its length. Drive between the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; and the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is taken through the flexible elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and it is only necessary that the ends of the elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> be attached to the relatively rotatable components. Thus, as another alternative, the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and mounted rotationally with respect to the retract gear <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Drive from the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the retract drive <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that other similar lost motion mechanisms can be used in place of that illustrated. For instance, mechanisms employing a ball travelling in a spiral groove are known whereby motion is only allowed while the ball travels between the two ends of the spiral groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that these various lost motion mechanism can also be used in place of the lost motion mechanism described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for the tilt gear arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Considering overall operation, upon rotation of the gear train <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in one direction, drive will immediately be transmitted via the clutch mechanism of the tilt drive to rotate the slats of the blind in the relevant direction. However, at this time, the lost motion mechanism of the retract drive will not transmit any drive to retracting or deploying the slats. Once the lost motion mechanism of the tilt drive has reached its full extent, the clutch mechanism of the tilt drive will disengage drive to tilting the slats. On the other hand, once the lost motion mechanism of the retract drive has reached its full extent, drive will be provided to retract or deploy the slats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the lost motion mechanism of the retract drive should not reach its full extent until the lost motion mechanism of the tilt drive has reached its full extent and disengaged the clutch. Preferably, the lost motion mechanism of the retract drive has an extent which is at least equal or greater than the extent of the lost motion mechanism of the tilt drive. In particular, so that retraction or deployment of the slats does not occur immediately at the end of tilting the slats, a period of no action should preferably be provided. This is particularly advantageous when the drive mechanism is powered by a motor, since it will be difficult for a user to precisely control the motor to stop its operation at the changeover between tilt drive and retract drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Referring again to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), it will be seen that an additional drive mechanism exists between the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the retract output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;. In particular, a planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> transmits drive from the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;. The planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> includes a pivot shaft <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which pivots in a bearing aperture <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in the intermediate drive component <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the figures, the aperture <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is offset from the axis of the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> causes the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to move along a circular path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The retract output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; is of annular form with inwardly facing teeth <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The outwardly facing teeth <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> mate or mesh with the inwardly facing teeth <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is also provided with two radially extending arms <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>a and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The arms <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>fit into corresponding openings <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>a and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>b in the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>&prime; such that the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is only able to rotate by a limited amount relative to the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the retract mechanism is operated and the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is rotated, the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is moved in a circular path around the retract output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;. Since the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is restrained from rotation by the arms <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>b, the interference between its outwardly facing teeth <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the inwardly facing teeth <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; causes the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> moves the pivot shaft <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in a clockwise circular path, the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> attempts to rotate anti-clockwise about its own axis. However, upon such rotation, the upper arm <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will abut the left side of the opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the lower arm <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will abut the right hand wall of the opening <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. With the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> restrained in this manner, further movement of the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in its circular path will cause the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Similarly, anti-clockwise movement of the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> about its circular path will cause it to rotate clockwise about its own axis until the arms <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abut the opposite walls of the openings <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when an attempt is made to rotate the gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; to transmit motion back through the mechanism, the mechanism locks up. Thus, the weight of the slats or pulling of the slats in either direction will not operate the mechanism and the slats will be held securely in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When an attempt is made to rotate the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;, the mating gears <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> attempt to rotate the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> about its own axis, i.e. rotating shaft <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in aperture <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. However, in the same way as described above, the arms <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>abut walls of the openings <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to prevent such rotation. In this way, the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is unable to move any further and, in particular, is not moved around the circular path required to move the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Of course, this mechanism will also have the same effect in various other configurations, for instance with the planet gear on the outside of an output gear having outwardly facing teeth. Similarly, the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> will transmit rotation from the intermediate drive <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; or lock up whenever it is restrained from rotation relative to the housing. However, it could be allowed to rotate through a limited extent between these two situations. For instance, the planet gear <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> could be limited to rotate by nearly a complete revolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that this mechanism could be used with or without the lost motion and single drive mechanisms described above. Similarly, it could be used in conjunction with the tilt drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, the output gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; meshes with a crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; which in turn engages a chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime;. As described above for the previous embodiment, the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; mates with the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; to form an overload clutch. In particular, the mating part of the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided with a series of radial protrusions which are of generally rounded shape. The corresponding inwardly facing portions of the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed as resilient bridge pieces which extend over recesses and are, therefore, radially outwardly deflectable. Thus, if the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; is forcibly rotated relative to the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime;, the bridge pieces are able to deflect and allow relative rotation between the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; and the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime;. In this way, forcible movement of the blind or chain will cause relative rotation between the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; and the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; rather than damaging the drive mechanism. Of course, the mating surfaces of the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; and crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime; could be reversed with the resilient parts being provided on the crown gear <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&prime;. Indeed, other forms of overload clutch could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> illustrate an alternative embodiment to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Similar reference numerals as used in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the index &ldquo;denote functionally equivalent parts to those explained above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In particular, the planet and crown gear mechanism is replaced by a worm gear mechanism and the second lost motion mechanism of the retract drive is arranged coaxially with the first lost motion mechanism of the tilt drive. The assembled mechanism is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, in this embodiment, the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime; of the previous embodiments acts as the sole drive gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&Prime;. A retraction drive take-off gear <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is provided coaxially with the drive gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&Prime; and rotatably on the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the drive gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The lost motion mechanism for the retract drive is then provided by means of a flexible elongate member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; similar to that of the previous embodiment which extends between the drive gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&Prime; and the retraction drive take-off gear <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Hence, in this embodiment, the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>&Prime; fulfills the function of the spacer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the previous embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the retraction drive take-off gear <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is transferred to the pinion end <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of a worm gear <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> by means of an intermediate gear <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Thus, rotation of the retraction drive take-off gear <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> results in rotation of the worm gear <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent from the figures, rotation of the worm gear <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> causes rotation of the mating worm wheel <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and, hence, also the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> By virtue of this worm gear arrangement, forces, for instance resulting from the weight of the blind are not transmitted back through the mechanism. In other words, the blind will remain where positioned despite forces acting on it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the previous embodiments, mating parts of the worm wheel <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&Prime; provide an overload clutch. In this way, if the blind or retract chain <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&Prime; is forcably moved, for instance beyond one of its end positions, the chain wheel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&Prime; is able to slip relative to the worm wheel <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and prevent the mechanism from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Since, compared to the previous embodiments, the chain wheel is provided vertically on the side of the mechanism, the housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>&Prime; is provided with an opening which is filled by a chain wheel cover <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, this embodiment is generally similar to the previous embodiments with a plurality of lost motion wheels <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>&Prime; driving a last wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>&Prime; and the tilt drive <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&Prime;. It will be appreciated that the shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>&Prime; has, at its end, a non-circular cross-section end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime; which mates with the clutch drive component <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>&Prime;. As illustrated, this cross-section includes <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> protrusions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> For embodiments using the elongate flexible member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, it is noted that particularly suitable cord materials would include high tensile strength yarns such as KEVLAR or NOMEX, both by DuPont, TWARON by Akzo-Nobel, DYNEEMA by DSM or SPECTRA by Allied Fibres. Such materials have tensile strengths in the range of 28 to 35 grams per denier. In particular, Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW-PE), such as DYNEEMA or SPECTRA, has a tensile strength exceeding that of steel and has flexibility and fatigue resistance superior to Aramid fibres, such as KEVLAR, TWARON or NOMEX products. The first mentioned highly sophisticated polyethylene material is particularly suitable for high load applications and is also often referred to as High Modulus Polyethylene (HMPE) or High Molecular Density Polyethylene (HMDPE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Referring again to the overall construction, since the drive mechanism includes a single drive train <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&Prime; for operating both the tilt drive and retract drive, a drive source may be meshed with the gear train at any position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> correspond to the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. In particular, the end cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in which the drive mechanism is provided includes an opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> through which the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may mesh with the tilt gear <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. However, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, it may be preferred to mount the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on top of the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>, the end cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on its upper surface such that the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can mesh with the intermediate gear <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the mechanism housing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> preferably includes the non-circular opening <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> for receiving the non-circular head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the latch <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this way, the relative positioning of the drive gear <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and intermediate gear <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> For convenience the end cap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be provided with both the opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Additional components may be provided for filling or closing these openings when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the drive mechanism described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> could be used in conjunction with a manual cord operation. Indeed, a manual cord unit including a gear to mesh with the drive train <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> could be provided to attach to the head rail as a separate unit in place of the motor unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the drive mechanism could be used to operate horizontal slats. Indeed, the head rail <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could be mounted vertically in order to control horizontal slats. </paragraph>
