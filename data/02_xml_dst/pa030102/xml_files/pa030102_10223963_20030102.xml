<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention deals with lithium and lithium-ion batteries which exhibit surprisingly high capacity retention at high discharge rates and long cycle life, and with an elevated temperature melt process for the fabrication thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art to employ graphite current collectors in electrochemical cells, particularly in environments which present a risk of corrosion for metal collectors. The metal collectors, except for this potential corrosion, are preferred for their high current-carrying capability. In some cases noble metals are employed but their high costs preclude their use in most commercial applications. Most typically aluminum and copper are the materials of choice for current collectors in lithium and lithium-ion cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Toyuguchi et al., JP-A Sho 58(1983)-115777, discloses an artificial graphite plate current collector employed in a lithium metal/polyacetylene cell wherein a solution of LiClO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>in propylene carbonate or lithium tetrafluoroborate in gamma-butyrolactone is employed as the electrolyte. Charging efficiency is shown to be much improved over comparable cells having metal current collectors. Charging efficiency was determined utilizing charge-discharge cycles of 2 hours or longer, that is the currents employed represent no more than 50% of that required to discharge the cell in one hour. The cell employed by Toyuguchi is not a lithium-ion cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> British Patent Specification 1,214,4123, to the Standard Oil Company, discloses the use of a flexible graphite sheet as a current collector embedded in a carbon electrode useful in a molten salt battery involving the use of binary salt electrolytes, primarily a combination of LiCl and KCl. The graphite sheet was of a thickness of ca. 250 &mgr;m, and was characterized by electrical resistivity in the plane of the sheet of 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>ohm-cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Gratzel et al., WO 99/59218, is drawn to a lithium or lithium-ion battery of which one electrode is composed of a solid material characterized by a mesoscopic morphology. Disclosed are secondary (rechargeable) cells wherein lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl) imide or lithium tris(trifluorosulfonyl) methide may be employed as electrolytes in aprotic solvents. A cell comprising TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as the anode and Li<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>Mn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>as the cathode, a solution of lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl) imide in methoxypropionitrile as the electrolyte solution, and a paper separator was found to sustain a 10 C discharge rate and maintain a cell voltage of 1.5V. Current collectors are conducting indium tin oxide deposited on glass substrates. A TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>anode is preferred over a carbon anode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Fujimoto et al., JP Hei 5 (1993)-290887, discloses a secondary lithium-ion cell comprising a cathode of a lithium metal oxide compound, a cathode current collector of a graphite powder composite with polypropylene resin, an anode of powdered graphite, an anode current collector of a copper foil, and an electrolyte solution of LiCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. The battery cell so formed is said to provide improvements over the existing state of the art cells which employ LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>electrolyte in conjunction with cathode current collectors of aluminum, the improvements being a reduction in explosion hazard in a short circuit, and the charge discharge characteristics improved. A cell having a capacity of 500 mA-h was discharged at 200 mA in the voltage range of 4.1 to 3 volts; a very high percentage of the capacity was utilized, and restored upon recharging. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides several surprising and important benefits over the art of lithium-ion batteries. In the present state of the art, LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>dissolved in an aprotic solvent mixture is typically combined with an aluminum current collector on the cathode side of a ca. 3 volt or higher lithium-ion battery because it represents a good trade-off of several desired attributes which are well known to one of skill in the art. However, LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>exhibits some drawbacks, as outlined in Fujimoto et al., op.cit. A major drawback of LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is a lack of thermal stability which seriously limits both the operating temperature of the battery and largely precludes any battery manufacturing process which requires heating the LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>above a temperature of about 100&deg; C. This is a particularly serious limitation in a manufacturing process based upon melt processing the components of a lithium cell such as that described in Doyle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,092. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Fujimoto et al., op.cit., propose to replace LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>with CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> which provides a remedy to the drawbacks noted therein, and further provides superior thermal stability. A graphite composite current collector, made from graphite powder and a polymeric binder selected from polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyethylene terephthalate is substituted for the standard aluminum because of the corrosiveness of the CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> salt. However, as shown herein below, CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> causes a catastrophic loss of capacity retention at high discharge rates compared to the LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>systems, thus eliminating batteries based upon CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> from any application requiring any but relatively low discharge rates. In the present invention, the imide and methide salts herein described in combination with a pure graphite foil cathode current collector provide cells of surprisingly high capacity retention at high rates of discharge and high cycle life together with high thermal stability. It is a particularly surprising result, however, that in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the capacity retention at high rates exceeds that of the current state of the art which comprises LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>in combination with an aluminum current collector. In other words, the lithium-ion battery cell of the present invention is capable of providing higher power than the LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>/aluminum cell. When one considers the orders of magnitude higher conductivity of aluminum versus graphite, this is a remarkable result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electrode composition of the invention is formed into a sheet or film by any suitable method known in the art, and contacted with the current collector to form a laminated structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The conductive additives suitable for use in the process of making a cathode are the same as those employed in making the anode as hereinabove described. As in the case of the anode, a highly preferred electron conductive aid is carbon black, particularly one of surface area less than ca. 100 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g, most preferably Super P carbon black, available from the MMM S.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The Li-ion cell preferred for the present invention may be assembled according to any method known in the art. In a first method in the art, exemplified by Nagamine et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,796, electrodes are solvent-cast onto current collectors, the collector/electrode tapes are spirally wound along with microporous polyolefin separator films to make a cylindrical roll, the winding placed into a metallic cell case, and the nonaqueous electrolyte solution impregnated into the wound cell. In a second method in the art, exemplified by Oliver et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,293 and Venuogopal et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,015, electrodes are solvent-cast onto current collectors and dried, the electrolyte and a polymeric gelling agent are coated onto the separators and/or the electrodes, the separators are laminated to, or brought in contact with, the collector/electrode tapes to make a cell subassembly, the cell subassemblies are then cut and stacked, or folded, or wound, then placed into a foil-laminate package, and finally heat treated to gel the electrolyte. In a third method in the art provided by Gozdz et al. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,456,000 and 5,540,741, electrodes and separators are solvent cast with also the addition of a plasticizer; the electrodes, mesh current collectors, electrodes and separators are laminated together to make a cell subassembly, the plasticizer is extracted using a volatile solvent, the subassembly is dried, then by contacting the subassembly with electrolyte the void space left by extraction of the plasticizer is filled with electrolyte to yield an activated cell, the subassembly(s) are optionally stacked, folded, or wound, and finally the cell is packaged in a foil laminate package. In a fourth method in the art, described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/383,129, the electrode and separator materials are dried first, then combined with the salt and electrolyte solvent to make active compositions; by melt processing the electrodes and separator compositions are formed into films, the films are laminated to produce a cell subassembly, the subassembly(s) are stacked, folded, or wound and then packaged in a foil-laminate container. The third and fourth methods are exemplified in the specific embodiments of the present invention described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cathode current collector suitable for the lithium or lithium-ion battery of the present invention comprises graphite. Highest conductivity is generally achieved in pure graphite, so it is preferred that the graphite sheeting contain as few binders, additives and impurities as possible in order to realize the benefits of the present invention. Binders, additives and impurities are also undesirable because of their potentially deleterious effects on battery performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The graphite current collector suitable for the present invention may be in the form of a powder coating on a substrate such as a metal substrate, a free-standing sheet, or a laminate. That is the current collector may be a composite structure having other members such as metal foils, adhesive layers and such other materials as may be considered desirable for a given application. However, in any event, according to the present invention, it is the graphite layer, or graphite layer in combination with an adhesion promoter, which is directly interfaced with the electrolyte of the present invention and is in electronically conductive contact with the electrode surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One particularly preferred form of graphite is the flexible low density graphite sheeting described in J. H. Shane et al., U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The flexible graphite sheeting preferred for the practice of the present invention may be compounded with other ingredients as may be required for a particular application, but graphite having a purity of ca. 95% or greater is highly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At a thickness below about 10 &mgr;m, it may be expected that electrical resistance could be unduly high, so that thickness of less than about 10 &mgr;m is less preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Strictly speaking, the operability of the present invention does not require the incorporation into the electrode composition of a binder.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Gelled polymer electrolytes are formed by combining the polymeric binder with a compatible suitable aprotic polar solvent and, where applicable, the electrolyte salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> PEO and PPO-based polymeric binders can be used without solvents. Without solvents, they become solid polymer electrolytes which may offer advantages in safety and cycle life under some circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Other suitable binders include so-called &ldquo;salt-in-polymer&rdquo; compositions comprising polymers having greater than 50% by weight of one or more salts.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Mixtures of suitable electrolyte solvents, including mixtures of liquid and polymeric electrolyte solvents are also suitable. Preferred electrolyte solvents are organic carbonates. Most preferred are mixtures of ethylene carbonate and dimethylcarbonate, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, or ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, and diethylcarbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The electrolyte solution suitable for the practice of the invention is formed by combining the lithium imide or methide salt herein described, with optionally a co-salt selected from LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, LiPF<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>fm </subscript></highlight>where n&plus;m&equals;6 and R<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>&equals;CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, LiBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiAsF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, or LiClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, along with the electrolyte solvent by dissolving, slurrying or melt mixing as appropriate to the particular materials. The present invention is operable when the concentration of the imide or methide salt is in the range of 0.2 to up to 3 molar, but 0.5 to 2 molar is preferred, with 0.8 to 1.2 molar most preferred. Depending on the fabrication method of the cell, the electrolyte solution may be added to the cell after winding or lamination to form the cell structure, or it may be introduced into the electrode or separator compositions before the final cell assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The separator suitable for the lithium or lithium-ion battery of the present invention is any ion-permeable shaped article, preferably in the form of a thin film or sheet.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> wherein R and R&prime; are independently selected from F, Cl or a perfluorinated alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a&equals;0, 1 or 2, b&equals;0 to 6, and the imide and methide derivatives thereof as described in Feiring et al., WO 9945048(A1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the electrode suitable for use in the practice of the invention, the most preferred binders are polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or a copolymer of polyvinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene (p(VdF-HFP)) such as that available commercially under the trade name KYNAR FLEX&reg; available from Elf Atochem North America, Philadelphia, Pa.

This electrode can then be cast from solution onto a suitable support such as a glass plate or a current collector, and formed into a film using techniques well-known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the present invention the cathode is brought into electronically conductive contact with the graphite current collector with as little contact resistance as possible. This may be advantageously accomplished by depositing upon the graphite sheet a thin layer of an adhesion promoter such as a mixture of an acrylic acid-ethylene copolymer and carbon black. Suitable contact may be achieved by the application of heat and/or pressure to provide intimate contact between the current collector and the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The flexible graphite sheeting preferred for the practice of the present invention provides particular advantages in achieving low contact resistance. By virtue of its high ductility, conformability, and toughness it can be made to form particularly intimate and therefore low resistance contacts with electrode structures that may intentionally or unintentionally proffer an uneven contact surface. In any event, in the practice of the present invention, the contact resistance between the cathode and the graphite current collector of the present invention does not exceed 50 ohm-cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, preferably does not exceed 10 ohms-cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and most preferably does not exceed 2 ohms-cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For the purpose of the present invention, contact resistance may be determined by any convenient method as known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Simple measurement with an ohm-meter is possible. It has been found to be convenient in the practice of the present invention to determine the real part of the complex impedance measured by the method described in Example 3 hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the anode is brought into electronically conductive contact with an anode current collector which is preferably a metal foil or mesh, most preferably copper. As in the case of the cathode, it may be advantageous to employ an adhesion promoter there-between. Of course for optimum operation, it is desirable to minimize the contact resistance between anode and anode current collector following the practices of the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electrode films thus produced are then combined by lamination with the current collectors and separator.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the following specific examples, capacity retention as a function of discharge rate is determined. Each test cell as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was first fabricated in the discharged state. After fabrication, using a Maccor 9100 tester, it was subject to charging at a current 7.5 mA to a voltage of 4.15 V, followed by discharging at a constant current of 10 mA to 2.7 V. The cell was cycled five times between 2.7 V and 4.15 V at a constant current of 10 mA. Following this formation, the cell was discharged at a constant current of 15 mA and the time for the voltage to drop from 4.15 to 2.7 V was measured to provide the slow discharge rate capacity reference point. The cell was then charged again at 15 mA to 4.15 V, and discharged through the same voltage range at progressively higher constant currents in repeated charge and discharge cycles, with the capacity being expressed as a percentage of the reference discharge capacity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The anode was laminated to the copper collector in the same manner. The separator was then placed between the laminated cathode and anode structures and the entire package went through a final lamination step at 95&deg; C., 41.4 kPa nip pressure, and a roll speed of 0.3 m/min. A shim 20 &mgr;m thinner than the combined thickness was employed. Lamination of the components was performed in ambient air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The dibutyl phthalate of the cell was removed by two successive extractions with excess diethyl ether, each 30 minutes in length.

<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the Grafoil&reg; of Example 1 was employed as therein described. All the solid components were dried under vacuum at 120&deg; C. and contained less than 30 ppm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. Unless stated otherwise, all the processing after the drying step was carried out inside an argon-filled dry box. The binder in the electrodes and the polymer in the separator were lithium sulfonate form of a hydrolyzed copolymer of vinylidene fluoride (VF) and perfluorosulfonyl fluoride ethoxy propyl vinyl ether (PSEPVE), prepared according to the method of Doyle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,092. The polymer contained 9&tilde;10 mol % of PSEPVE and had a molecular weight estimated to be ca. 200,000 Da. The solvent was a 2:1 by weight mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC, battery grade from EM Industries, Hawthorne, N.Y.) and butylene carbonate (JEFFSOL&reg; BC, Huntsman Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A cathode composition was prepared by combining, 8.7 g of the binder, 7 g of Super P carbon black from MMM Carbon, 58 g of LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>obtained from FMC Corporation, and 26.3 g of the EC/BC mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The anode composition was prepared by combining 8 g of the same polymer as in the cathode, 4.5 g of the carbon black, 64 g of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB grade 2528) obtained from OSAKA Gas, and 23.5 g of the mixture of EC/BC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The separator was formed from a composition consisting of 25% by weight of the same polymer, 75% of the EC/BC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The anode and cathode compositions were prepared by respectively mixing the dry components in a Waring blender for about 1 minute. The EC/BC solvent mixture was added to the blender and blending was continued for an additional minute. While still in the dry box, the mixture so formed was added to the mixing chamber of a Haake Rhomix&reg; 600 mixer (Haake (USA), Paramus, N.J.) equipped with roller rotors and mixed at about 5 rpm and 125&deg; C. for 20 minutes. The resultant mixture was quickly removed from the mixer and placed into a glass jar within 1 min. The thus prepared composition was taken outside of the dry-box in a sealed Kapton&reg; polyimide bag and predensified in the bag at 125&deg; C. on a Carver Model M hydraulic press (Fred Carver Inc., Menomonee Falls, Wis.) for 3 minutes at 30 psi compression pressure on the sample. The resultant film was taken back into the dry box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The calender employed for preparing the cell is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The layered cell components, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, were fed to a horizontal inlet heater assembly consisting of bottom heated feed plate, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, having a width of 218 mm and a length of 205 mm, and a top heated plate, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, having a width of 154 mm and a length of 205 mm, the top heated plate, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, being disposed above the bottom heated feed plate, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a sufficient distance to permit the introduction of the layered cell components, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, without touching the top heated plate. The entire inlet heater assembly is in the form of an electrically heated hollow tube of rectangular cross-section. From the inlet heater assembly, the layered cell components are introduced into the gap, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, formed between two polished, electrically heated chrome-surfaced nip-rolls, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, 100 mm in diameter and 155 mm wide, one of which rolls, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is driven, the gap being adjustable within the range of 0.025 to 0.250 mm. After passing through the nip-rolls the now laminated cell strip, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is fed out via an exit plate, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, having a width of 210 mm and a length of 165 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The anode and cathode films prepared in the hydraulic press, as above described, were calendered at 130&deg; C. roller temperature after 2 min preheating in the inlet heater assembly at 135&deg; C., then passed through the nip rolls at a total nip force of 260 kg and roller speed of 0.1 m/min. A 45 mm&times;55 mm electrode film was cut from the calendered film with a blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The separator was prepared by first mixing the polymer with the EC/BC using a spatula. The mixture was spread manually between two sheets of Kapton&reg; polyimide film as described hereinabove with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> utilizing a 5 mil copper shim. The assembly so formed was preheated at 115&deg; C. for 2 minutes, then calendered at a line speed of 0.1 m/min, at a total nip force of 170 kg, and a temperature of 125&deg; C. to achieve 4 mil separator thickness. The laminator settings were: roller speed 0.1 m/min, roller force of 86 kg, 2 minutes preheating at 115&deg; C. and the roller temperature at 125&deg; C. A separator film (50 mm&times;60 mm) was cut from the film so prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The cathode film was aligned to the top of the flexible graphite current collector (top being where the cathode tab sticks up as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), then laminated to the current collector. The laminator rolls was set at 125&deg; C., 170 kg nip force, speed 0.25 m/min using a shim that was approximately 12.5 &mgr;m thinner than the combined thickness of the cathode and collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The anode was aligned to the top of the Adocote treated Cu mesh where the tab sticks up as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, then laminated to the Cu mesh current collector under the same conditions as those employed for the cathode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The separator was positioned between the laminated anode and cathode according to the method hereinabove described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the entire package went through a final lamination step at 95&deg; C., 6.0 psi nip pressure, and line speed 0.3 m/min with a shim that was approximately 12.5 &mgr;m thinner than the combined thickness of the cell components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The resulting cell was then soaked in the LiTFSI electrolyte of Example 1 for 60 minutes. The soaking took place in a petri dish. The weight of the electrolyte the cell absorbed was 0.318 g. The cell was then sealed in a bag. The bag material used was class ES material from Shield Pack (West Monroe, La.). The sealer used was a hand-held Audion Futura Poly Twin model (Packaging Aids Corp., San Rafael, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The sealed bag was transferred outside the dry-box and was sealed again with a floor mounted Model 20A V-60966(Vertrod, Brooklyn, N.Y.), which was a water-cooled impulse type sealer. The resulting cell is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The first cycle electrochemical efficiency was determined to be 78.2%. The accumulated capacity loss over five cycles was 3.1% of the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>discharge capacity. This cell was not subject to the 2 C discharge rate test because the cell developed an internal short circuit after the initialization cycles. Therefore, no further test was done. The loss after the five initialization cycles was 3.1% , more than the cell of Example 1, but still much better than that of Comparative Example A. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The contact impedance of the cathode-graphite collector interface was measured as follows. Using the cathode film from Example 1, untreated Grafoil, and laminating films together at 135&deg; C., the structure C/G/C/C/G/C was fabricated, where C is cathode and G is Grafoil. Tabs of the Grafoil extended out beyond the cathodes, and the size of the cathodes was 2.2 cm&times;5.0 cm. Using a four-point-probe AC voltmeter, the impedance was measured between the two Grafoil pieces. The impedance at frequencies between 1 Hz and 10 kHz was found to be almost entirely real (resistive) with very little imaginary (capacitive) component, and of 0.5 ohm magnitude. The observed resistance was much higher than that calculated based on the bulk electrical conductivity of the cathode, hence the impedance is a measure of resistance at the interfaces between the cathodes and the current collectors. As the structure has 2 C/G interfaces in series, the contact impedance for one C/G interface was calculated as 0.5 ohm&times;2.2 cm&times;5.0 cm&times;({fraction (1/2)})&equals;2.8 ohm cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
