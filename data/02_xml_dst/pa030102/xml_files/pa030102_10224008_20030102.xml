<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to x-ray tubes incorporating a nanostructured carbon film electron emitter for use in portable x-ray spectrometry, portable fluoroscopy, and radiation treatment, and more particularly to x-ray tubes using carbon nanotubes as the electron emission source. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, numerous methods and apparatuses have been developed for x-ray generation. For a number of years, apparatuses have been manufactured using x-ray fluorescence spectrometers for elemental analysis. In these devices, the sample has been excited by emptying either a radioacative isotope or an x-ray tube. Obsolescence of the use of a radioactive isotope is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,647 which describes a method for using an x-ray tube in conjunction with a filtering mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to increasing environmental and governmental requirements and regulations, the use of radioactive isotopes for excitation purposes has not been favored in the design of these devices. With respect to portable x-ray spectrometers, the need for a lightweight, and low cost unit have forced the continued use of radioactive isotopes as the excitation source. This has the disadvantage of both increased environmental and safety compliance issues associated with the radioactive source as well as the disadvantage of the lack of control over the excitation characteristics of the source. The inability to control the excitation parameters of the radioactive source is a hindrance for the use of the apparatus for certain applications where excitation selectivity is required. More recent approaches to this limitation have resulted in apparatus that no longer contains a radioactive isotope as the excitation source but employ a thermionic x-ray tube. The x-ray tube is powered by an on-board high voltage supply as well as a filament supply necessary to heat the thermionic cathode. These components are separate components linked by a high voltage cable, typically operating in a manner such that heat dissipation from the isolated anode limits extended use of the device. This also results in a unit which is much larger, heavier and more costly than portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometers which rely on radioactive isotopes for excitation. Predominately, these portable devices are limited for single purpose use, such as transition element identification and quantification for the purposes of alloy identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of low energy x-rays is commonly employed in radiation therapy. In an effort to minimize collateral tissue damage, considerable design focus has been placed on localizing the radiation only near the tissue requiring treatment. In the case of intra-cavity therapy, radioisotopes are commonly employed as this enables small amounts of material to be placed near the treated area. However, radioisotopes present several limitations, which this invention addresses. Firstly, as an x-ray tube can be controlled, the exact amount of energy desired can be delivered to the treated area. However, x-ray tubes are not commonly found in intra-cavity therapy, as they are too big, require multiple sources of power for both the filament and high voltage, and generate too much heat, causing collateral tissue damage. This invention eliminates the need for the filament supply and furthermore allows for a very small x-ray tube to be produced which generates sufficient low energy x-rays without unnecessary heat generation caused by the thermionic cathode structure. Secondly the use of a small x-ray tube for radiation therapy allows for multiple uses of the same device, eliminating the need for replacement. Finally, as the device only produces radiation when energized, handling and regulation requirements are substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One of the essential requirements for a brachytheropy x-ray tube is that no part of the exterior of the tube reach a higher temperature than 40 C. This is necessary to prevent damage to tissue in immediate contact with the tube. To hold the exterior of the tube to that low temperature the heat generated at the x-ray target the by the intercepted electron beam must be removed from the quickly and efficiently. Another requirement is that the exterior of the x-ray tube and any connecting tubes or cables must be at zero (ground) potential to prevent exposure of surrounding tissue from electric fields and currents. Satisfying these requirements in very small tubes requires integration of the x-ray tube components with a cooling system to provide an effective therapeutic x-ray dose in a reasonable treatment time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is the primary object of this invention to provide a cold emitter x-ray tube using a nanostructured carbon film or carbon nanotubes as the electron emission source in such an x-ray tube. The advantage of this objective lies in the elimination of the heat requiring thermionic cathode. This allows for a total smaller package of the high voltage power supply and x-ray tube, as well as a device which generates less heat as the nanostructured carbon film or carbon nanotubes emits sufficient electrons at or near room temperature. Other objects and advantages include providing an x-ray tube using a nanostructured carbon film or carbon nanotubes coated on the internal structure of the x-ray tube at ground potential. This allows for the x-ray tube to generate sufficient x-ray flux while retaining the heat within the x-ray tube. In this fashion, the external temperature of the x-ray tube remains at or near room temperature and prevents tissue damage due to excessive heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the methods and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A cold emitter x-ray tube is provided comprised of a cathode which is preferably a carbon nanotube or nanostructured carbon film which serves as the electron emission source in an x-ray tube, and is positioned on a suitable substrate. A metal anode which functions as the x-ray generating target is positioned within the x-ray tube.

This single source of high potential serves to provide the electric field, between the emitter and anode, for extracation of electrons from the emitter and to accelerate the electrons to the target for generation of x-rays. Alternatively, the x-ray tube can be operated in a bipolar manner, with the respective cathode and anode at opposite polarities. X-rays pass through a beryllium window that is an integral part of the vacuum envelope. The x-ray tube may be used for various applications such as portable x-ray spectrometry, portable fluoroscopy, radiation treatment, and the like.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> preferred embodiment of cold emitter x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. X-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in its simplest form is a diode, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The diode is comprised of cathode being a carbon emitting film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, on a suitable substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a metal anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which functions as the X-ray generating target. The carbon film used for an emission cathode may, in one embodiment, comprise a layer of thin carbon film on a substrate, with 244 nm and 2-7 mW excitation, and within the wave number from 1100 to 18550 cm-1, the carbon film has a distinct UV Raman band in the range from 1578 cm-1 to 1620 cm-1 with a FWHM from 25 to 165 cm-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A high voltage source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be any high voltage power source, with a negative contact <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is connected to the emitter and the positive contact <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, connected to the anode target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This single source of high potential serves to provide the electric field, between the emitter and anode, for extraction of the electrons <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, from the emitter and to accelerate the electrons to the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for generation of x-rays. X-rays pass through the beryllium window <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that is an integral part of the vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Nanostructured carbon films, as used herein, are preferably composed of nanocrystalline graphite, carbon nanotubes, diamond, diamond like carbon or a composite of two or more of the above. The films are manufactured by deposition from plasma formed from a gas mixture, which contains at least one hydrocarbon gas. Carbon films are preferably deposited on glass, ceramic, metal or semiconductor substrates to form a cold, electron-emitting cathode. The electron emission mechanism is electric field assisted tunneling through the carbon film surface, or fieled emission. When placed in a high voltage field, these nanostructure carbon films emit electrons with sufficient current density to allow for the production of x-rays. With the introduction of an electron extraction grid placed between the nanostructure carbon films and the anode target, the amount of electron beam current can be accurately controlled. The entire device is sealed in a glass or metal ceramic body structure and seal under high vacuum. In this manner the device can be used without assisted pumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that nanostructured film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is coated on an internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at ground potential. X-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is with the diode comprised of cathode being a carbon emitting film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, coated on an internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be a surface of a component of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the inner surface of vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or other positions as desired within x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a particular application. Metal anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is shown which functions as the x-ray generating target and a high voltage source with negative contact connected to the emitter and the positive contact connected to the anode target. This single source of high potential serves to provide the electric field, between the emitter and anode, for extraction of the electrons <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, from the emitter, and to accelerate the electrons to the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for generation of x-rays <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. X-rays <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, pass through beryllium window <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is an integral part of the vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show x-ray tubes, containing a cold carbon cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which the x-ray target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and the target post <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is made from tungsten copper. This composite material is suitable for generating high x-ray intensity and providing a high conductance path for the target heat to the heat exchanger. The ratio of tungsten to copper is chosen such that the thermal expansion of the target post exactly matches that of the ceramic high voltage insulator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Other alloys or composites may also be chosen depending upon the energy distribution required in the x-ray spectrum of the tube. Matching the thermal expansion rates of the target post <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and ceramic <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, has the advantage of allowing the target post to be brazed directly to the metalized ceramic with high temperature alloys, or to an unmetalized ceramic with an active metal alloy. The target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, can also be modified by brazing any other suitable, metal, target material to the target post to improve the x-ray spectrum for specific uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In operation, the heat generated by the electron beam colliding with the target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, is conducted through the target post and the high conductance interface provided by the braze metal, thence through the ceramic <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, to the heat exchanger channels. As the temperature rises and falls the metal ceramic structure expands and contracts as one part so there is minimum stress on the joining braze that could joint to fail under extreme operating conditions or from fatigue due to temperature cycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the x-ray tube with a cold carbon cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is whown, in which the location and configuration of the target post <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to the ceramic insulator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, is suitable for generating high x-ray intensity that is optimally suited for pulsed operation. In this embodiment the target temperature may rise by several hundred degrees during the electron beam pulse and fall sharply during off period between pulses. The temperature swing is substantially lower at the location of the braze. In this embodiment, the generated x-rays pass directly through a ceramic x-ray window <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The ceramic x-ray window acts as a low pass filter, reducing the amount of lower energy, and undesirable, x-ray flux. This tube configuration can certainly be operated continuously but is not the optimal configuration for operation with high intensity beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> preferred configuration of target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, to insulator ceramic <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, for continuous operation is shown. In this case the braze material extends the entire length of the target post <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this manner, both the target post and the ceramic conduct heat to the heat exchanger surfaces <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, resulting in lower overall internal temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> very small cold cathode x-ray tube is shown, intended for use in intra body and intra cavity therapy. Tubes used in these medical applications are desired to be less than 4 mm in diameter and less than 2 cm in length. Realization of very small x-ray tubes is greatly aided by combining more than one of necessary functions required for successful operation into individual parts used to construct the tube. It is integrated here with the liquid cooling and heat conducting features depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The result is reduced parts count and simplified construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5,</cross-reference>, the carbon electron emitting film is deposited on the inner, concave surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, of the x-ray transmission window <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and serves as the cathode for the tube. The electrons are emitted into the converging electric field between the cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, window <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and the target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The electrons are focused and accelerated toward the target by the electric field. X-rays are generated when the electrons strike the target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and are emitted back through the window <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, as a divergent beam of x-rays. By controlling the curvature of the window/emitting surface, and the amount of area coated with the nanostructured film, the electron spot of the anode target can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a miniturized cold cathode x-ray tube intended for use is intra body and intra cavity therapy. X-ray tubes used in such medical applications are desired to be less than 4 mm in diameter and less than 2 cmin length. Realization of this embodiment is made possible by the use of a bi-polar mode of operation. In this embodiment, the cold cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is placed at either a positive or negative potential, while the anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is place at a corresponding opposite polarity. Thus, to achieve a typical 50 kV mode of operation, the cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is placed at &plus;25 kV, while the anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is placed at &minus;25 kV. This mode of operation is also possible if the cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed at &minus;25 kV, while the anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is placed at &plus;25 kV. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> further shows the insulating ceramic <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the W anode target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the high voltage lead <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, connected to the distal end of the x-ray tube, with a second high voltage lead <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, connected to the proximal end of the x-ray tube. The water channel <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, is connected to the water tubing <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, to aidin heat dissipation of the heat generated by the x-ray production process at the anode target <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an extraction/suppression grid is shown incorporated within x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Nanostructured film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is preferably coated on an internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, at ground potential. X-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is with the diode comprised of a cathode being a carbon emitting film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, coated on an internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Internal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be a surface of a component of x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the inner surface of vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or other positions as desired within x-ray tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a particular application. Metal anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown which functions as the x-ray generating target and a high voltage source with negative contact connected to the emitter and the positive contact connected to the anode target. This single source of high potential serves to provide the electric field, between the emitter and anode, for extraction of electrons <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, from the emitter and to accelerate the electrons to the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for generation of x-rays <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. X-rays <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> pass through a beryllium window <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is an integral part of the vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the carbon electron emitting film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, can be attenuated using an extraction grid or suppression grid placed between the electron emission source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the target anode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically represents this embodiment with the extraction grid or suppression grid controlled by a voltage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, independent of the high voltage source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. By raising the voltage from 0 volts DV to &tilde;1000 VDC, the grid functions as an extraction grid. In this manner the electrons are accelerated towards the high voltage field <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The advantage of this grid is the ability to increase the anode to cathode gap, thereby allowing for higher operation potentials in a smaller form factor. Another advantage of this control grid is the ability to control the emission current, and thus x-ray output flux, independent of the applied high voltage. Another advantage of the control gird is the ability to protect the cold cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, during high voltage processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Means are provided for adjusting the cathode to anode gap in a cold cathode diode tubes, for fixing the exact current to voltage ratio for a vacuum diode with a cold carbon based cathode. Preferably, an adjustable metal diaphragm or bellows allows the cold cathode to be moved closer or further from the anode without interrupting the vacuum envelope of the tube. The thickness and physical characteristics of the metal can be chosen such that it will retain its deformed position once the force and fixtures used to move it is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> preferred embodiment is illustrated, as applied to a cold carbon cathode x-ray tube. In practice the tube including the bellows <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is first tested to determine whether the voltage to current ratio is above or below the desired value. If adjustment is required a fixture is installed that grips the portion of the vacuum envelope <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, on which the anode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is mounted and a force is applied to the deformable member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, to set it to the desired position. This adjustment can be made with the voltages applied to allow viewing the voltage current ratio during the adjustment process. The adjustment means can also be incorporated as part of the tube, however, it adds parts to the assembly that have no function in the end application for the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the present invention as applied to a very small x-ray tube is shown. In this case the deformable member is a diaphragm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the dimensions of the tube are so small that it impractical to use a screw to apply the moving force. In this embodiment the cold cathode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to anode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, gap would always be set to a greater distance than desired, that is, a higher voltage to current ratio. The adjustment of the voltage to current ratio to the desired value is then always in one direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Using the present invention, a method of gettering residual gasses in small, cold cathode, x-ray tubes is also possible. The limited volume in very small x-ray tubes makes it difficult to employ evaporable getters for scavenging the residual gas from the tube as is the practice in larger tubes. Non-evaporable getters cannot be used unless some means is provided to prevent them from being saturated by absorbing gasses while the tube is being assembled and processed. This invention places the non-evaporable getter material in a cavity <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, with a very small aperture between the volume of the tube and the getter cavity. The cavity may be made a small capsule or be included in one of the tube components. The small aperture restricts the flow of gasses into the getter cavity to restrict it from being saturated during the assembly and processing of the tube. After the tube is assembled and sealed the getter will continue to absorb gasses from the tube at a rate determined by the size of the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In operation and use, the cold emitter x-ray tube of the present invention is extremely safe and environmentally clean. It may be used in a wide variety of applications including portable x-ray spectrometry, portable fluoroscopy, and radiation therapy, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As is evident from the above description, a wide variety of applications and systems may be envisioned from the disclosure provided. The apparatus and methods described herein are applicable in any type of x-ray tube and additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The invention in its broader aspects is, therefore, not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus and illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures from such details may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the applicant&apos;s general inventive concept. </paragraph>
