<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to improved methods of securing a trailer slider to a trailer at any of a number of incrementally adjusted positions. The embodiments generally disclose wedged interfitting members, and/or a plurality of connections on each side of the frame of the trailer and the slider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Trailers as utilized in modem vehicles are typically supported by a slider or bogey. The slider carries the wheels, suspensions, brakes, etc. Due to varying load and handling conditions, the location of the slider is desirably moved relative to the trailer. Thus, the two are typically provided with a plurality of selectable mount locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, some system is actuated to withdraw positioning pins from interfitting holes in a trailer frame and in a slider frame. With the pins at the withdrawn location, the slider can be adjusted relative to the trailer. Once the slider is at a new desired location the pins are actuated to move back through a new set of matched holes, again securing the slider on the trailer, but at a new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While the prior art has been successful, it would be desirable to provide improved connection, and reduce the complexity and number of steps required for adjusting the slider relative to the trailer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a series of disclosed embodiments, two main features could be said to be common. In one main feature, there is a wedged shape complimentary interlocking surface between the trailer and the slider. This provides a very secure connection. Another main feature of connection disclosed in this application is the use of a plurality of interlocking surfaces on each lateral side of the trailer and slider. Again, the use of the plurality of connections provides a very secure locking function. Some of the embodiments include both features, and others include one or the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, dog-toothed locking members are driven into wedge shaped openings on the trailer frame. The dog-toothed locking members are driven into a locking position to securely lock the slider relative to the trailer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a toothed lever carries a plurality of teeth on each lateral side of the trailer and slider. The lever is biased to a locking position where it engages a plurality of teeth on the trailer. The lever is movable to a retracted position at which the slider can move relative to the trailer to a new position. At the new position the lever is again driven to its locking position with a plurality of teeth interlocking to secure the slider relative to the trailer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a rotating locking member carries a plurality of teeth which are selectively moved into slots on one of the trailer or slider. This mechanism is somewhat similar to the adjustable seat track mechanisms, and provides a secure and easily adjustable connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a clip member is driven against an angled surface on the frame of the trailer to provide a wedged and secure connection. The clip member is preferably spring biased to its locked position, and movable to its unlocked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings, the following of which is a brief description. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a prior art trailer and slider combination <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The trailer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rides on the slider <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which carries the wheels, suspension, brakes, etc. The slider is typically movable between several positions (Position <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Position <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc.) as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the trailer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> typically includes a frame rail <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having holes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The slider <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has its own rail <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and carries positioning pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is actuated to retract the pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the openings <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In a retracted position the slider can roll relative to the trailer and allow adjustment of the position of the slider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The above described prior art has proven successful, however, it would be desirable to provide a more secure and easier operating connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an embodiment <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> wherein the slider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is positioned between frame rails <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the trailer. The frame rails <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are provided in an exposed face with a plurality of wedged shaped openings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The slider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> carries a number of dog-toothed clutch members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which are typically spring biased inwardly and into the frame rail <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Thus, the dog-toothed clutch members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are typically in the engaged position shown. A piston <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is included in a cylinder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, and a control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> drives the piston outwardly to an unlocked position such as is shown in phantom at <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. When the control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> releases the mechanism from this unlocked position the spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> drives the dog-toothed member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> back to its locked position. The wedged connection between the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the dog-toothed clutch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides a very secure and very reliable connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The wedged connection provides a holding force in both the direction of travel of the trailer, but also in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> embodiment has its holding force directed inwardly, with the clutch members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being driven in a lateral inward direction. This embodiment thus provides a very secure holding force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another embodiment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> wherein the slider <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> carries a lever <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> pivotally connected at <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are formed on the lever <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The teeth <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> interfit with a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the trailer rail <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A handle <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> allows an operator to pivot the lever <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> about point <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and in opposition to a spring force <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is mounted on a portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the frame of the slider <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Now, the handle <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be actuated to move the lever <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the illustrated position to a position at which teeth <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are not received in teeth <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The slider <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may then be adjusted. As is known, there is a similar mechanism on each lateral side of the trailer, and it may be that a single actuation handle <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is utilized to actuate both levers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Moreover, an automatic control such as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be utilized to drive both levers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As with the prior embodiment there is a wedge-shaped interaction now between the slider and the trailer. Further, there are a plurality of locking locations again increasing the security of the connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show yet another embodiment <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> wherein the slider frame <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> carries a locking mechanism <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having an actuation handle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> biases the locking mechanism <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to its locked position, by causing the locking member <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to be driven to rotate in a particular location about an axis <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is marked on frame <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for rotation such as by bearings <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. A plurality of slots <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are formed in a trailer frame <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extend into the slots <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in the locked position. When it is desired to move the slider relative to the trailer, the handle <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is actuated against the force of spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the fingers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> move outwardly of the slots <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. The slider position may then be adjusted and the spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is allowed to drive the fingers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> back to the locked positions in the slots <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Again, the use of the plurality of locking surfaces increases the security of the mount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> wherein the slider member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is secured to a trailer frame <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at an angled location <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that provides a wedging lock. A clip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes an inner hook portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> driven by a resilient spring sleeve <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> against a plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> movable with the clip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is operable to move the clip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> laterally to the left as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, or outwardly of the lateral side of the trailer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In the extended released position, the slider <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can move relative to the trailer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is then returned to its retracted position and the spring <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> forces the hook <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> against the angle <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> providing a wedged connection. Structurally, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> system looks somewhat similar to safety clips which are utilized to hold a slider on a trailer today. However, the known safety clips are not biased into engagement with the trailer, and do not serve to hold the slider on the trailer, but rather to ensure the trailer will not slide off of the slider should the prior art positioning pins fail or not be actuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The embodiments generally include surfaces wherein the holding surface is wedged shaped. Stated another way, the interacting surfaces change in surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Several embodiments of this invention have been disclosed, however, a worker in this art would recognize that modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention. </paragraph>
