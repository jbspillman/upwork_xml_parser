<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A stereolithographic (STL) apparatus for forming structures such as semiconductor die packages which uses a laser beam focused to a generally annular &ldquo;spot&rdquo; having an annulus of enhanced laser power surrounding a central &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of reduced (or no) laser power. The structures are formed of a stack of light-polymerized photopolymer layers. Scanning of a beam having power concentrated in the annulus enables simultaneous production of a self-supporting structure having at least semisolid, smooth lateral outer polymer walls and an upper hardened polymer skin extending over liquid polymer still lying between the walls. The structure may be subjected to heat or broad source light of suitable wavelength after removal from the STL apparatus to accelerate complete polymerization of the structure to a solid state. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to stereolithography and, more specifically, to the use of stereolithography in forming multilayer solid structures with vertical or near-vertical sides, such structures including packages for semiconductor devices and other electronic components and assemblies thereof </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past decade, a manufacturing technique termed &ldquo;stereolithography&rdquo; (STL), also known as &ldquo;layered manufacturing,&rdquo; has evolved to a degree where it is employed in many industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Essentially STL, as conventionally practiced, involves utilizing a computer to generate a three-dimensional (3-D) mathematical simulation or model of an object to be fabricated, such generation usually being effected with 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) software. The model or simulation is mathematically separated or &ldquo;sliced&rdquo; into a large number of relatively thin, parallel, usually vertically superimposed layers, each layer having defined boundaries and other features associated with the model (and thus the actual object to be fabricated) at the level of that layer within the exterior boundaries of the object. A complete assembly or stack of all of the layers defines the entire object, and surface resolution of the object is, in part, dependent upon the thickness of the layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The mathematical simulation or model is then employed to generate an actual object by building the object, layer by superimposed layer. A wide variety of approaches to stereolithography by different companies has resulted in techniques for fabrication of objects from both metallic and nonmetallic materials. Regardless of the material employed to fabricate an object, stereolithographic techniques usually involve disposition of a layer of unconsolidated or unfixed material corresponding to each layer within the object boundaries, followed by selective consolidation or fixation of the material to at least a semisolid state in those areas of a given layer corresponding to portions of the object, the consolidated or fixed material also at that time being substantially concurrently bonded to a lower layer. The unconsolidated material employed to build an object may be supplied in particulate or liquid form, and the material itself may be consolidated or fixed or a separate binder material may be employed to bond material particles to one another and to those of a previously formed layer. In some instances, thin sheets of material may be superimposed to build an object, each sheet being fixed to a next lower sheet and unwanted portions of each sheet removed, a stack of such sheets defining the completed object. When particulate materials are employed, resolution of object surfaces is highly dependent upon particle size, whereas when a liquid is employed, surface resolution is highly dependent upon the minimum surface area of the liquid which can be fixed and the minimum thickness of a layer which can be generated. Of course, in either case, resolution and accuracy of object reproduction from the CAD file is also dependent upon the ability of the apparatus used to fix the material to precisely track the mathematical instructions indicating solid areas and boundaries for each layer of material. Toward that end, and depending upon the layer being fixed, various fixation approaches have been employed, including particle bombardment (electron beams), disposing a binder or other fixative (such as by ink-jet printing techniques), or irradiation using heat or specific wavelength ranges such as found in a generated laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An early application of stereolithography was to enable rapid fabrication of molds and prototypes of objects from CAD files. Thus, either male or female forms on which mold material might be disposed might be rapidly generated. Prototypes of objects might be built to verify the accuracy of the CAD file defining the object and to detect any design deficiencies and possible fabrication problems before a design was committed to large-scale production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In more recent years, stereolithography has been employed to develop and refine object designs in relatively inexpensive materials and has also been used to fabricate small quantities of objects where the cost of conventional fabrication techniques is prohibitive for same, such as in the case of plastic objects conventionally formed by injection molding. It is also known to employ stereolithography in the custom fabrication of products generally built in small quantities or where a product design is rendered only once. Finally, it has been appreciated in some industries that stereolithography provides a capability to fabricate products, such as those including closed interior chambers or convoluted passageways, which cannot be fabricated satisfactorily using conventional manufacturing techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To the inventors&apos; knowledge, stereolithography has yet to be applied to mass production of articles in volumes of thousands or millions, or employed to produce, augment or enhance products including other, pre-existing components in large quantities, where minute component sizes are involved, and where extremely high resolution and a high degree of reproducibility of results is required. Furthermore, conventional stereolithography apparatus and methods fail to address the difficulties of precisely locating and orienting a number of preexisting components for stereolithographic application of material thereto without the use of mechanical alignment techniques or to otherwise assure precise, repeatable placement of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the electronics industry, state-of-the-art packaging of semiconductor dice is an extremely capital-intensive proposition. In many cases, discrete semiconductor dice carried on, and electrically connected to, lead frames are individually packaged with a filled-polymer material in a transfer molding process. A transfer molding apparatus is extremely expensive, costing at least hundreds of thousands of dollars in addition to the multihundred thousand dollar cost of the actual transfer molding dies in which strips of lead frames bearing semiconductor dice are disposed for encapsulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, encapsulative packaging of a semiconductor device already mounted on a substrate by molding and other presently used methods may be very difficult, time-consuming and costly. In some cases, the device may be packaged using a so-called &ldquo;glob-top&rdquo; of a material such as silicone, but the resulting seal is usually nonhermetic, the technique requires either substantial area around a die or a dam structure to contain the gel-like material, and the &ldquo;package&rdquo; boundary is not well-defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Use of stereolithography for packaging of semiconductor device components has been suggested. See, for example, copending U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 09/259,142 and 09/259,143, each filed on Feb. 26, 1999 and the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference. While the feasibility and effectiveness of such a packaging technique has been proven, it has been recognized by the inventors herein that it would be desirable to achieve a surface finish on stereolithographically formed packaging and other structures which is superior to that presently obtainable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an improvement to a stereolithography (STL) apparatus for forming a precisely dimensioned and finished miniature structure from a liquid or semiliquid photopolymer material by precise scanning of a beam of polymerization stimulating laser light. The structure is created by forming one or more layers of at least partially hardened or semisolid material, in which each subsequently formed layer is at least partially overlying and attached to a previously formed layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While the method and apparatus of the invention may be broadly applied to the fabrication of either a freeform structure or a structure attached to another object or objects, it will be exemplified herein as applied to the packaging of small items such as electronic components and, specifically, semiconductor dice. For example, a semiconductor die may be provided by this invention with a protective structure in the form of a layer of dielectric material having a controlled thickness or depth over an upper or lower surface and stacked layers located adjacent to lateral or peripheral die surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;package&rdquo; as employed with reference to electrical components includes partial as well as full covering of a given semiconductor die or other electronic component surface with a dielectric material and specifically includes, without limitation, partial and full covering of a bare semiconductor die as well as a semiconductor die previously configured as a so-called &ldquo;chip scale&rdquo; package, wherein the package itself, including the die, is of substantially the same dimensions as, or only slightly larger than, the die itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The packaging method of the present invention may be applied, by way of example and not limitation, to a die mounted to a lead frame (having a die mounting paddle or in a paddleless leads-over-chip (LOC), or in a leads-under-chip (LUC) configuration), mounted to a carrier substrate in a chip-on-board (COB) or board-on-chip (BOC) arrangement, to flip-chip configured semiconductor dice, or in other packaging designs, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention employs computer-controlled, 3-D CAD initiated, stereolithographic techniques to apply protective and alignment structures to an electronic component such as a semiconductor die. A dielectric layer or layer segments thereof may be formed over or adjacent a single die or substantially simultaneously over or adjacent a large number of dice or die locations on a semiconductor wafer or other large-scale semiconductor substrate, individual dice or groups of dice then being singulated therefrom. The package may be formed, after singulation of the die from a wafer, to cover the lateral surfaces as well as the upper and/or lower surfaces of the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Precise mechanical alignment of singulated semiconductor dice or larger semiconductor substrates having multiple die locations is not required to practice the method of the present invention, which includes the use of machine vision to locate dice and features or other components thereon or associated therewith (such as lead frames, bond wires, solder bumps, fiducial marks, etc.) as well as features on a larger, carrier substrate for alignment and material disposition purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the object or structure is fabricated using precisely focused electromagnetic radiation in the form of an ultraviolet (UV) wavelength laser under control of a computer and responsive to input from a machine vision system such as a pattern recognition system to fix or cure a liquid material in the form of a photopolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A multilevel package structure is formed for example, by partially submerging an object such as a semiconductor die in a bath of liquid photopolymer material, the latter forming a thin layer comprising the lowermost portion of the package structure. A generally vertical laser beam of coherent radiation is controllably scanned over selected portions of the thin layer of photopolymer material for partial polymerization thereof, forming a self-supporting rigid or semirigid layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The object is then lowered to form a second thin layer of liquid photopolymer material over the prior, partially polymerized layer, followed by laser exposure. A stack of partially polymerized layers may thus be serially formed, comprising as many consecutive layers as are required to achieve the desired structure height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Conventional laser systems used in STL equipment are capable of providing a focused laser beam &ldquo;spot&rdquo; of the desired diameter for die packaging, i.e., about 0.002-0.008 inch. While it is considered desirable to generate a laser beam which in scanning forms a spot with uniform power exposure or density throughout the spot, the power is nevertheless typically concentrated in the middle, or central, portion of the beam spot. Thus, as the polymerization-stimulating laser beam is scanned over a photopolymer material, the effective exposure and resulting initiation and stimulation of polymerization of the photopolymer will be greatest in a central region of the scanning path, with a rapid fall-off to either side. As a result, the exterior surfaces of a layered photopolymer structure&apos;s lateral walls are not immediately polymerized to a desired degree, and interstitial crevices are formed at the joints between adjacent layers. The resulting lateral wall surfaces of a photopolymer structure assume a &ldquo;log cabin&rdquo; appearance exemplified by a series of parallel, horizontally disposed and clearly discrete (although mutually bonded) &ldquo;logs&rdquo; of photopolymer. The horizontal crevices between the photopolymer logs may attract dust, moisture and other contaminants, and the effective wall thickness at the crevices is undesirably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> However, even if the beam power was to be somehow evenly distributed over the beam spot, the log cabin effect cannot readily be avoided because the effective exposure time is greatest at the center of the scanning path of the round scanning beam, i.e., where there is exposure to the full diameter of the beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a conventional STL laser system is modified so as to provide a beam spot of annular configuration comprising a higher beam power density in laterally exterior portions thereof. The annular beam spot surrounds a central &ldquo;hole&rdquo; portion with a lower (or even essentially zero) beam power density. As a result, during scanning of the beam over the surface of liquid photopolymer, the layer being formed receives higher exposure along its lateral edges, and lesser exposure in its central or inner portion, which is still adequately exposed as the annular beam spot moves laterally as the beam is scanned. The resulting, multilayer walls are thus effectively and smoothly cured and hardened without overexposure of the central portions scanned. The exposure of the central portion may be controlled by manipulation of the laser beam power to be only sufficient to initially form at least a semisolid &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of hardened polymer at the top of a given layer over unpolymerized material retained therebelow between two walls of at least semisolid photopolymer resulting from exposure to the annular beam spot. A subsequent full hardening step such as may be conducted in an oven after the photopolymer structure is formed accelerates the polymerization of any liquid polymer trapped within the structure and forms a single cohesive object with smooth side walls, i.e., without the aforementioned log cabin effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The laser system used to achieve the desired annular spot in an STL apparatus may be configured in several ways. In one embodiment, the laser system includes an unstable optical resonator whereby power flows outwardly from the optical axis of the resonator. The optical resonator may be a confocal resonator employing one concave mirror and one convex mirror. The convex mirror forms the output coupling device for providing diffraction output coupling around the periphery of the output mirror. The output beam is collimated and focused to an annulus surrounding a central &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of significantly reduced radiation density. In another embodiment, the laser system comprises a nitrogen ring laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Use of the annular beam spot in an STL apparatus for fabricating structures in accordance with the present invention results in structures having uniformly polymerized, smooth side walls. The STL fabrication of miniature structures with enhanced dimensional precision and much reduced dimensional variability is enabled by use of an annular laser beam spot employed in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>

The method will be exemplified by the packaging of a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of protective polymeric dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The data is preferably formatted in an STL (for StereoLithography) file, STL being a standardized format employed by a majority of manufacturers of stereolithography equipment. Fortunately, the format has been adopted for use in many solid-modeling CAD programs, so often translation from another internal geometric database format is unnecessary. In an STL file, the boundary surfaces of an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are defined as a mesh of interconnected triangles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (which may comprise a removable reservoir interchangeable with other reservoirs containing different materials) of liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be employed in fabricating the intended object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is hardened by exposure to light in the UV portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. The surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is automatically maintained at an extremely precise, constant magnitude by devices known in the art responsive to output of sensors within apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and preferably under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, referenced above and previously incorporated herein by reference, discloses one suitable level control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A support platform or elevator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown, having an upper surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and moved by platform actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is precisely vertically movable by actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in fine, repeatable increments responsive to control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is located for movement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> downward into and upward out of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or structures placed on the platform may comprise a base upon which objects or structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed by a stereolithographic process in this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for generating a beam of light or laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the UV wavelength range has associated therewith appropriate optics and galvanometers. In one embodiment, the laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is reflected by reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to shape and define laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is directed downwardly toward the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and scanned or traversed in the X-Y plane, that is to say in a horizontal plane, in a selected pattern under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The thin layer of liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is exposed to laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as it is scanned in an X-Y plane is at least partially cured thereby to at least a semisolid state for shape retention and surface smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Data from the STL files resident in the memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is manipulated to build an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> one layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D, etc at a time. The object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed on a base which may comprise the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a pre-existing object such as die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> placed on the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or some other object. Accordingly, the data mathematically representing an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is divided into subsets, each subset representing a slice or layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This is effected by mathematically sectioning the 3-D CAD model into a plurality of horizontal layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc., a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; of such layers representing object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each slice or layer may be from about 0.0001 inch to about 0.0300 inch thick. The preferred range of layer thickness is from about 0.002 inch to about 0.020 inch. A slice or layer with a relatively small layer thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> promotes higher resolution by enabling better reproduction of fine vertical surface features of an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In addition, attenuation of the laser beam by passage through the liquid photopolymer is minimized. On the other hand, an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of layers having greater thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will have fewer layers; thus, it is constructed with fewer scans of the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the overall production rate is typically higher. </paragraph>

The use of such base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is an enlarged view of a portion of the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on which supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are first formed to support semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A packaging object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is then fabricated about and over semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in contact with the exterior surfaces <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Where a &ldquo;recoater&rdquo; blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is employed as described below, the interposition of base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> precludes inadvertent contact of blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with platform surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Before fabrication of an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is initiated with apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the primary STL file for an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the file for base support(s) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (if used) are merged. It should be recognized that, while reference has been made to a single object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, multiple objects or structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the same or different configurations may be concurrently fabricated on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In such an instance, the STL files for the various objects or structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, if any, are merged.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Before initiation of a first support layer for a support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A for an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is commenced, computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> automatically checks and, if necessary, adjusts by means known in the art as referenced above, the surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to maintain same at an appropriate focal length for laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, referenced above and previously incorporated by reference, discloses one suitable level control system. Alternatively, the height of reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be adjusted responsive to a detected surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to cause the focal point of laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be located precisely at the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> if level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is permitted to vary, although this approach is somewhat more complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may then be submerged in liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a depth equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of one layer or slice <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the liquid surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> readjusted as required to accommodate liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> displaced by submergence of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then activated so that laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will scan liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to at least partially cure (e.g., at least partially polymerize) liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at selected locations, defining the boundaries of a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A (of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as the case may be) and filling in solid portions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered by a distance equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of a layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, and the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> scanned to define and fill in the second layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B while simultaneously bonding the second layer to the first. The process is then repeated, layer by layer, until object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If a recoater blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is employed, the process sequence is somewhat different. In this instance, the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is lowered into liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> below surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, then raised thereabove until it is precisely one layer&apos;s thickness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A below blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> then sweeps horizontally over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or (to save time) at least over a portion thereof on which object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are to be fabricated, to remove excess liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and leave a film thereof of the precise, desired thickness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered so that the surface of the film and surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are coplanar and the surface of the material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is still. Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then initiated to scan with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and define the first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. The process is repeated, layer by layer, to define each succeeding layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. and simultaneously bond same to the next lower layer until object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (or supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as the case may be) is completed. A more detailed discussion of this sequence and apparatus for performing same is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, previously incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the above approach to preparing a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for scanning with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by lowering platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to flood material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or over the highest completed layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, then raising platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and horizontally traversing a so-called &ldquo;meniscus&rdquo; blade across the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or just the formed portion of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) one layer thickness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereabove, followed by initiation of laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and scanning of laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to define the next higher layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As yet another alternative to layer preparation of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to merely lower platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a depth equal to that of a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be scanned, and then traverse a combination flood bar and meniscus bar assembly (not shown) horizontally over platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or merely over the location of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) to substantially concurrently flood liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and define a precise layer thickness <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> All of the foregoing methods and apparatus for liquid material flooding and layer thickness control are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Where a horizontal thickness dimension of the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is greater than two parallel passes of the laser beam, each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably built by first defining any internal and external object boundaries of that layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, then hatching solid areas of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between those boundaries with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If a particular part of a particular layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is to form a boundary of a void in the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> above or below that layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, then the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is scanned in a series of closely spaced, parallel vectors so as to develop a continuous surface, or skin, with improved strength and resolution. The time it takes to form each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> depends upon its geometry, surface tension and viscosity of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and laser scanning speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the practice of stereolithographically packaging semiconductor devices and the like, a consistent problem has been the appearance of a &ldquo;log cabin&rdquo; effect on the side walls of the package. This problem is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Due to the geometry and power distribution of the conventional circular laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the lowermost comer regions including exterior lower corner regions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>A and interior lower corner regions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B of each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. do not receive sufficient UV radiation exposure to form a hardened, continuous wall surface. Instead, adjacent layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. are separated by longitudinal crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the external wall surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, resulting in nonuniformity of the protective layer thickness <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a negative aesthetic effect. In addition, as noted previously, the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are contaminant collectors and undesirably reduce wall thickness of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. While interior crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> also are formed on internal wall surfaces <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> adjacent the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, liquid photopolymer trapped in the crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> eventually hardens, which may be accelerated by elevating the temperature of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in an oven. Thus, there is no need for additional STL steps to fill the interior crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> There are several contributing factors to reduced polymerization in the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. First, the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is used typically has a power density which is a maximum in the central portion of the beam, and which falls off rapidly toward the outer edges thereof. Thus, edge portions of the structure being fabricated are deprived of laser energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Secondly, lateral scanning of a round beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> along a given path results in maximum power transfer (density) near the center of the path and much reduced power transfer near the edges of the path. This is true even for a laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a uniform power density throughout its transverse cross section. However, it is more typical to have a laser beam in which the power density is higher in the central portion of the beam, exacerbating the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The remainder of this discussion will be in relation to the exemplary object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> depicted as designed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to have walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with exterior surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, interior surfaces <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and an upper surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. It may be formed as a standalone item or may be formed about another object, as for example about and over a semiconductor die. The object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed by an STL laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> focused to a spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is scanned to produce each layer. In the present invention, laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is modified as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to form an annular laser beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with reduced, or minimal power in a central &ldquo;hole&rdquo; <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and substantially greater power in the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed of a stack of layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. each having a layer thickness or depth identified by the numeral <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in exemplary object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed, by way of illustration only, in layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C, etc. defined in two parallel, mutually adjacent passes of a laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and are depicted as having a thickness <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> equal to two diameters <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of focused beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Of course, it is possible and in many cases desirable (due to enhanced fabrication speed), if a wall thickness equal to only a single diameter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of focused beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is desired, to form the walls of object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through vertically superimposed, single passes of laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown in a stage of construction whereby the uppermost layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>F is being formed by laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as it is scanned or traversed in direction <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> along scan path <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Using a conventional circular laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with its centered power concentration, crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed along the lower corners of the formed layers, resulting in a log cabin effect. Even where the power density of the circular laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is shaped to be uniform throughout the beam, such log cabin effect will still occur because of net exposure time drop-off as distance <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from the beam path centerline <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> increases and the decrease in energy applied by circular laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the lower portion of the layer of liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being cured as the energy is absorbed by the upper portion of the layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. There is no perceptible rounding of the upper edges of layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as even minimal exposure to the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the surface of the liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will initiate polymerization. As shown, exemplary lines of equal net power density are denoted by numerals <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>D, where the power density decreases from <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>D. At line <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>D, the power density is insufficient to effect polymerization. In graph <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the right hand side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the power density <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is shown as a function of distance <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from the upper surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>F. Line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A refers to a vertical line along centerline <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B refers to a vertical line along the wall surface <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The present invention enables enhanced polymerization of each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; and is discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The stereolithography apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a commercially available STL system which is modified by the invention to enable smoothing of vertical side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of STL formed objects or structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example and not by way of limitation, the SLA-250/50HR, SLA-5000 and SLA-7000 stereolithography systems, each offered by 3D Systems, Inc. of Valencia, Calif. are suitable for modification. Liquid photopolymers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> believed to be suitable for use in practicing the present invention include Cibatool SL 5170 and SL 5210 resins for the SLA-250/50HR system and Cibatool SL 5530 resin for the SLA-5000 system, and Cibatool SL 7510 resin for the 7000 system. All of these resins are available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation. By way of example and not limitation, the layer thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be formed, for purposes of the invention, may be on the order of about 0.0001 to about 0.030 inch, and more preferably, from about 0.001 to about 0.020 inch, with a high degree of uniformity over a field on a surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having differing thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used to construct an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, so as to form a structure of a precise, intended total height or to provide different material thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for different portions of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The size of the laser beam &ldquo;spot&rdquo; <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> impinging on the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to cure same may generally be on the order of 0.001 inch to 0.01 inch, using presently available STL equipment. Resolution is preferably about &plusmn;10.0003 inch in the X-Y plane (parallel to surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) over at least a 0.5 inch&times;0.25 inch field from a center point, permitting a high resolution scan effectively across a 1.0 inch&times;0.5 inch area. Of course, it is desirable to have substantially this high a resolution across the entirety of surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be scanned by laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which area may be termed the &ldquo;field of exposure,&rdquo; such area being substantially coextensive with the vision field of a machine vision system employed in the apparatus of the invention as explained in more detail below. As the beam is scanned over a large field of exposure, the angle of incidence of the beam on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be as high as about 5 degrees from the vertical. While this deviation from vertical may result in slightly nonvertical structures, the deviation is less than the acceptable angular deviation in transfer-molding device packages. The longer and more effectively vertical the path of laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the greater the achievable resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings, it should be noted that apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes a camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is in communication with computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and preferably located, as shown, in close proximity to optics and scan controller, i.e., reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located above surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be any one of a number of commercially available cameras, such as capacitive-coupled discharge (CCD) cameras available from a number of vendors. Suitable circuitry as required for adapting the output of camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for use by computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be incorporated in a board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> installed in computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is programmed as known in the art to respond to images generated by camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and processed by board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may together comprise a so-called &ldquo;machine vision system,&rdquo; and specifically a &ldquo;pattern recognition system&rdquo; (PRS), operation of which will be described briefly below for a better understanding of the present invention. Alternately, a self-contained machine vision system available from a commercial vendor of such equipment may be employed. For example, and without limitation, such systems are available from Cognex Corporation of Natick, Mass. For example, the apparatus of the Cognex BGA Inspection Package&trade; or the SMD Placement Guidance Package&trade; may be adapted to the present invention, although it is believed that the MVS-8000&trade; product family and the Checkpoint&reg; product line, the latter employed in combination with Cognex PatMax&trade; software, may be especially suitable for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It is noted that a variety of machine vision systems are in existence, examples of which and their structures and uses are described, without limitation, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,526,646; 4,543,659; 4,736,437; 4,899,921; 5,059,559; 5,113,565; 5,145,099; 5,238,174; 5,463,227; 5,288,698; 5,471,310; 5,506,684; 5,516,023; 5,516,026; and 5,644,245. The disclosure of each of the immediately foregoing references is hereby incorporated by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate practice of the present invention with apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a data file representative of the size, configuration, thickness and surface topography of a pre-existing object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example, a particular type and design of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to be packaged, is placed in the memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the pre-existing object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, i.e., die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, is to be packaged with a lead frame, data representative of the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with an attached and electrically connected lead frame is provided. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, if packaging material in the form of the aforementioned photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to be applied only to an upper surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> (or portions thereof excluding active surface structures) of a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form upper package surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, or to the upper surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and portions or all of the side surfaces <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a large plurality of such dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for packaging. If package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are to be formed, it is desirable that the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprise, or be coated or covered with, a material from which the at least partially cured material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defining the lowermost layers of the package side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be easily released to prevent damage to the packaging. Alternatively, a solvent may be employed to release the package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> after packaging is completed. Such release and solvent materials are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,822 referenced above and previously incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Following mounting of the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is then activated to locate the position and orientation of each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to be packaged by scanning platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and comparing the features of the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with those in the data file residing in memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the locational and orientational data for each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then also being stored in memory. It should be noted that the data file representing the design size, shape and topography for the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be used at this juncture to detect physically defective or damaged dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> prior to packaging and to automatically delete such dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the packaging operation. It should also be noted that data files for more than one type (size, thickness, configuration, surface topography) of die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed in computer memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> programmed to recognize not only die locations and orientations, but which type of die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is at each location so that material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be cured by laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the correct pattern and to the height required to define package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and to provide a package upper surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> at the correct level and of the correct size and shape over each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Continuing with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the drawings, dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may then be submerged partially below the surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a depth the same as, or greater than the thickness of a first layer of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be at least partially cured to a semisolid state to form the lowest layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of a package side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> about each of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and then raised to a depth equal to the layer thickness, the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being allowed to settle. The material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> selected for use in packaging dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be one of the above-referenced resins from Ciba Specialty Chemical Company which exhibits a desirable dielectric constant, is of sufficient (semiconductor grade) purity, and which is of sufficiently similar coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) so that the package structure, i.e., object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> itself are not stressed during thermal cycling in testing and subsequent normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then activated and scanned to direct laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, about the periphery of each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to effect the aforementioned partial cure of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered into reservoir and raised to another side wall layer thickness-equaling depth increment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> activated to add another side wall layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B. This sequence continues, layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, until the package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are built up about dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A final layer or layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be applied over a portion or the entirety of the upper surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, forming an upper package surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> thereon. The layer thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be controlled to differ, depending upon the thickness required to cover the upper surfaces <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the dice. For example, a greater total thickness of material may be required to cover a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having wire bonds protruding upwardly therefrom than if a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is covered before connection to a lead frame. It should also be noted that the total thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over a selected portion of a given die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be altered die by die, again responsive to output of camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> or one or more additional cameras <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, shown in broken lines, detecting the protrusion of unusually high wire bond loops or other features projecting above the active surface of a given die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which should be, but is not, covered by the &ldquo;design&rdquo; or preprogrammed thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed over and at least partially cured on die upper surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In any case, laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is again activated to at least partially cure material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> residing over each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form a package top of one or more layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, wherein the package top is substantially contiguous with package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is controlled as desired to avoid certain surface features on dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, e.g., bond pads which are intended to be exposed for connection to higher-level packaging as by wire bonding, tape automated bonding (TAB) using flex circuits, or the use of projecting conductive connectors in a &ldquo;flip chip&rdquo; configuration. It should also be noted that the package top may be formed within an outer boundary defined by side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extending above upper (active) surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and forming a dam thereabout. In this instance, the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be submerged so that material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enters the area within the dam, raised above surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and then laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> activated and scanned to at least partially cure material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> residing within the dam. Alternatively, a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; may be cured by STL over the upper surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> entrapped thereby will be subsequently cured in a final curing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When the final layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>N is formed to complete the object or structure (die package) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is elevated above surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and excess liquid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is drained from the STL-formed object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be washed to remove all unpolymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the external surfaces. It should be noted that at this stage, the polymer comprising object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is typically in various degrees of polymerization, including liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> trapped in internal crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the uppermost layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>N may comprise a polymerized &ldquo;skin&rdquo; which traps unpolymerized or partially polymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therebelow. Following removal of the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a final curing step polymerizes and consolidates the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, including any liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the internal crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> or otherwise trapped within the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Post-cure of die packages formed according to the present invention may be effected with broad-source UW radiation emanating from, for example, flood lights in a chamber through which dice are moved on a conveyor, or in large batches. Curing in an oven at, for example, 160&deg; C. is another option which effects full curing of liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in interior crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in the formed object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, inadequate polymerization along the outer periphery of the laser beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is avoided by the use of a laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in which a major portion (or substantially all) of the power is located in a ring or outer annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the beam. The &ldquo;hole&rdquo; <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> within the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> preferably has a very low power density, but in fact, any reduction in power density in the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is beneficial. In any case, it is preferred, although not required, that the laser power output in the central hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> be less than about 0.6 of the power output in the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. However, in all cases the power level in central hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> should be less than or equal to the power level in annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For an annular laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a uniform power density in the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the net power density <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> across the diameter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the laser beam spot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as it is scanned may be as shown by numeral <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The beam path centerline <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is the line drawn by the central axis <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the moving laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. By way of comparison, a scanning full round beam will have the power density curve of <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In practice, the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may have a power density curve <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which may be nearly Gaussian. Of course, outer peripheral portions of the laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (typically at lower densities) may be cut off to limit the laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the desired diameter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. This also serves to enhance the power density at the outer periphery <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and provide a sharp separation for precise definition of an object&apos;s wall surfaces <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The diameter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; relative to the spot diameter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be expressed as a ratio RD having any value between about 0.1 and about 0.9. However, from a practical standpoint, the effective power exerted to the liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> scanned by the hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> should be sufficient to at least form a skin of hardened material over liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> trapped within the layer. Thus, a compromise will yield an R of between about 0.3 and 0.8, which is a preferred range. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, R&equals;0.64. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, ratio RLPD, the distribution of laser power density in the annulus portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and scanning speed are all specified or controlled so that in a single pass the wall surfaces to be formed are fully exposed to sufficient polymerizing power to form self-supporting walls exhibiting smooth surfaces, while simultaneously scanned portions in central portions of the scan path <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are sufficiently exposed to form a semihardened skin over underlying liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in each layer. As a result, the output of the STL apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is maximized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the laser beam may be a continuous wave (CW) beam or may be a rapidly repeating, intermittently pulsed beam, for example, having a pulse frequency which may be used effectively to smooth out variations in wall surfaces caused by the scanning motion. The pulse may comprise a waveform variance in power between a maximum and a minimum or comprise pulses having intermittent zero power time segments therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> There are several ways to produce an annular or semiannular laser beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for use in a stereolithography apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one method, for example, a nitrogen ring laser, as known in the art, produces a beam which is somewhat annular with respect to power density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the laser system used to achieve the desired annular spot in an STL apparatus may be configured as follows. The laser system may include an unstable optical resonator whereby power flows outwardly from the optical axis of the resonator. The optical resonator may be a confocal resonator employing one concave mirror and one convex mirror. The convex mirror forms the output coupling device for providing diffraction output coupling around the periphery of the output mirror. The output beam is collimated and focused to an annulus with a central &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of significantly reduced radiation density. The use of such apparatus to form high power annular laser beams, such as for metal cutting and the like, is known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,808, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Other methods for producing an annular laser beam of the desired shape, size, power and wavelength may exist, of which the inventors are currently unaware. Such methods may include optical, opto-mechanical, chemical and other technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Using the particular laser beam configuration of the invention, an object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such as a semiconductor die package may be formed with smooth, uniform thickness side wall surfaces <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in minimal time within apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A log cabin exterior, with attendant problems and deficiencies, is avoided. In this invention, portions of the object or structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which need to be adequately polymerized (i.e. hardened) receive a major portion of the beam power, without necessitating either an increase of the laser&apos;s total output power, or scanning at a reduced speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been disclosed in terms of certain preferred embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize and appreciate that the invention is not so limited. Additions, deletions and modifications to the disclosed embodiments may be effected without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed herein. </paragraph>
