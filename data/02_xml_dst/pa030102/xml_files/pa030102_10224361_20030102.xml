<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A First Embodiment of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a configuration of a multi-layer interconnection in a semiconductor device according to a First Embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment shows multi-layer interconnection formed by laminating five interlayer insulating films, and shows only a multi-layer interconnected device portion by omitting a semiconductor substrate carrying an integrated circuit formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In this drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a first SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-based interlayer insulating film, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a first dielectric film (first insulation film) formed on the upper surface of the first interlayer insulating film, which is formed of a material having an etching selectivity against the first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such as silicon nitride. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are second to fifth interlayer insulating films formed of the same material as the first interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are second to fourth dielectric films (second to fourth insulation films) formed of the same material as the first dielectric film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and formed between the interlayer insulating films, respectively. Numeral <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is a first metal film buried in the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and works as interconnection or conductive lead, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a second metal film similarly buried in the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and configuring one of the electrodes of the capacity element, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a third metal film similarly buried in the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and configuring the other interconnection. Numeral <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is a fourth metal film buried in the area corresponding to the third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is linked to the third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by removing the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between the fourth metal film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to form a thick interconnection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a fifth metal film buried in the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an area not corresponding to any metal film, and configuring another interconnection. Numeral <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is a sixth metal film buried in the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an area corresponding to the first metal film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and is connected to the first metal film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by removing the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between the sixth metal film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the first metal film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to form a plug between the first metal film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the eighth metal film to be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Numeral <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a seventh metal film buried in the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in an area corresponding to the second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and works as the other electrode of the capacity element formed between the seventh metal film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is an eighth metal film buried in the fourth interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in an area corresponding to the sixth metal film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and works as another conductive lead or interconnection, and is linked to the sixth metal film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by removing the third dielectric film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> present between the eighth metal film <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the sixth metal film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, thus configuring a plug. Numeral <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a ninth metal film buried in the fourth interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and works as another interconnection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows various elements provided in an interconnected device portion collectively for the ease of description, it will be needless to say that only required elements are incorporated in an actual interconnected device depending on the circuit configuration of each device. In an interconnected device of circuit configuration requiring a capacity element, the second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the seventh metal film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> configuring the capacity element are formed in required places. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This First Embodiment features that the sixth metal film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> configuring the plug and the fourth metal film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or the fifth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> configuring other interconnections or conductive paths are formed in the same third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The method for manufacturing the interconnected device will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Since The First Embodiment has the above-described configuration, the thickness of the entire interconnected device portion can be decreased in comparison with a conventional configuration having the same number of interconnections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the warp of wafers can be minimized, and erroneous sucking of wafers during wafer processing and defocusing during photoengraving can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The first through fourth dielectric films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be formed partially. Still, the same effect can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Next, a Second Embodiment of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This Second Embodiment features that a thick interconnection bridging across the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed, by the third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the fourth metal film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> connected therebetween as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In other words, an interconnection having a large cross section may be formed with thin horizontal width and thick vertical height. By such a configuration, the area occupied by interconnections can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also in this embodiment, the first through fourth dielectric films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be formed partially where needed. Still, the same effect can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, a Third Embodiment of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This Third Embodiment features that a capacity element is formed by the second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the seventh metal film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> placed therebetween as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The electrodes are formed by metal films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The capacity element of such a configuration has the feature that there is no voltage dependency as compared with a conventional capacity element in which electrodes are form by impurity doped silicon or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, a Fourth Embodiment of the present invention will be described below referring to drawings. FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> show cross sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing an interconnected device portion of a semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment. </paragraph>

Then, a first metal film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are formed in the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through a damascene process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is comprised of a material having an etch selectivity to the second interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, such as silicon nitride, is formed on metal films <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and further the third SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-based film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is deposited on the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a first photoresist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed at an area corresponding to the second metal film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an area corresponding to a fifth metal film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is to be formed in the third interlayer film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is etched using the first photoresist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a mask. The etching in this case is anisotropic etching whose etching rate for the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is seven times or more that for the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the etched area in a 100 &mgr;m&times;100 &mgr;m pattern using the second dielectric film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as an etching stopper. </paragraph>

Thereafter, a metal film is buried in the etched area of the third interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to form the configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Here, the fourth metal film <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> forms a thick interconnection together with the third metal film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing method of this embodiment, a plurality of metal films can be buried in a same interlayer insulating film. This means that plugs, interconnections, electrodes of capacity elements, or the like can be formed in a same one interlayer insulating film. Therefore, an increased number of interconnections can be formed by fewer process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For further reference, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a multi-layer interconnection structure, according to the present invention may be summarized as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect, the method comprises the steps of: forming a first interlayer insulating film on a semiconductor substrate; forming a first dielectric film on the first interlayer insulating film; forming a second interlayer insulating film on the first dielectric film; forming a first conductive lead in said second interlayer insulating film by using a damascene process; forming a second dielectric film on said second interlayer insulating film and first conductive lead; forming a third interlayer insulating film on the second dielectric film; etching a predetermined portion of the third interlayer insulating film by anisotropic etching; etching another predetermined portion of the third interlayer insulating film and the second dielectric film above the first conductive lead by anisotropic etching; and burying a metal film in the etched portions of said third interlayer insulating film to form a second conductive lead and a conductive plug reaching the first conductive lead in the third interlayer insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the method comprises the steps of: forming a first interlayer insulating film on a semiconductor substrate; forming a first dielectric film on the first interlayer insulating film; forming a second interlayer insulating film on the first dielectric film; forming a first conductive lead in said second interlayer insulating film by using a damascene process; forming a second dielectric film on said second interlayer insulating film and first conductive lead; forming a third interlayer insulating film on said second dielectric film; etching a predetermined portion of said third interlayer insulating film and said second dielectric film above the first conductive film by anisotropic etching; and burying a metal film in the etched area of said third interlayer insulating film reaching the first conductive lead to form a thick conductive lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect, the method comprises the steps of: forming a first interlayer insulating film on a semiconductor substrate; forming a first dielectric film on the first interlayer insulating film; forming a second interlayer insulating film on the first dielectric film; forming a first conductive lead in said second interlayer insulating film by using a damascene process; forming a second dielectric film on said second interlayer insulating film and first conductive lead; forming a third interlayer insulating film on the second dielectric film; etching a predetermined portion of the third interlayer insulating film above the first conductive lead by anisotropic etching; and burying a metal film in the etched portion of said third interlayer insulating film to form a second conductive lead in the third interlayer insulating film, thereby to form a capacitor element between the first conducive lead and the second conductive lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The effects and advantages of the present invention as described above may be summarized as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, in a semiconductor device, metal films for interconnections or conductive leads and plugs for connecting the interconnections in a different interlayer insulating films may be formed in one same interlayer insulating film. Therefore, the thickness of the entire interconnection device portion can be made thinner than that of a conventional device having the same number of interconnections. Further, the warp of wafers can be minimized, and erroneous sucking of wafers during wafer processing and defocusing during photoengraving are minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, in a semiconductor device, metal films are formed in specified corresponding locations of adjacent interlayer insulating films and joined together to form a thick metal film. Therefore, a thick interconnection is formed by linking the metal films of the neighboring interlayer insulating films, and the area occupied by interconnections can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, in a semiconductor device, a dielectric film is formed between neighboring interlayer insulating films, and the material for the dielectric film is selected to have etching selectivity against the interlayer insulating films. Metal films are formed in respective interlayer insulating films to sandwich the dielectric film to form a capacity element. Thus, the voltage dependency of the capacity element can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Still in another aspect, in a the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, metal films of different form or different kind are buried in a plurality of interlayer insulating films by a damascene process, so that an increased number of interconnections can be formed in fewer process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may by practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </paragraph>
