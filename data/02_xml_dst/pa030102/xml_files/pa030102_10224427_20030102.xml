<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a thin film used for a semiconductor device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a thin film by which it is possible to prevent the generation of impurities and physical defects in the thin film and an interface of the thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A thin film is typically used for a dielectric film of a semiconductor device, a transparent conductor of a liquid-crystal display, or a protective layer of an electroluminescent thin film display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In particular, a thin film used for a dielectric film of a semiconductor device should have no impurities or physical defects in the dielectric film or in the interface of the dielectric film and the substrate, so as to obtain a high capacitance and a small leakage current. Also, the thin film should have an excellent step coverage and uniformity. Accordingly, a thin film used for the dielectric film of a semiconductor device must be formed in a surface kinetic regime in which reactants containing atoms comprising the thin film are fully moved, and thus the growth rate of the thin film is linearly increased according to the deposition time. To do so, the thin film is typically formed using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. However, when manufacturing a thin film using a general CVD method, the atoms contained in a chemical ligand comprising the reactant remain during fabrication of thin film, which can thereby generate impurities in the thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to solve the problem, deposition methods for activating the surface kinetic region by periodically supplying the reactant to the surface of a substrate have been proposed. For example, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, a cyclic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) method, a digital chemical vapor deposition (DCVD) method, and an advanced chemical vapor deposition (ACVD) method have all been proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional deposition methods mentioned above generate impurities and physical defects in the thin film and the interface of the thin film during the fabrication of the thin film. Accordingly, they can deteriorate the characteristics of the thin film. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a thin film by which it is possible to prevent the generation of impurities and physical defects in the thin film and an interface of the thin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, a method for manufacturing a thin film is performed by loading a substrate into a reaction chamber and uniformly terminating dangling bonds on the surface of the substrate with a specific atom. Then, a first reactant is chemically adsorbed onto the terminated substrate by injecting the first reactant into the reaction chamber. After removing the first reactant physically adsorbed on the terminated substrate, a solid thin film is then formed through chemical exchange or reaction of the chemically adsorbed first reactant and a second reactant by injecting the second reactant into the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As used in this specification, chemical adsorption is a reaction (or combination) between different species, while physical adsorption is a reaction (or combination) between the same species. In general, chemical adsorption has a bonding energy greater than that for physical adsorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Before loading the substrate into the reaction chamber, an impurity layer adsorbed into or formed on the surface of the substrate may be removed. A removal of an intermediate reactant generated during the formation of the solid thin film may be further included after forming a solid thin film. The surface of the substrate is preferably terminated by repeatedly injecting gas including the specific atom such as an oxygen or nitrogen atom at least twice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A combination energy between an atom comprising the substrate and the specific atom is preferably larger than a combination energy between a ligand comprising the first reactant and the atom comprising the substrate. The solid thin film preferably a material selected from the group consisting of a single atomic thin film, a single atomic oxide, a composite oxide, a single atomic nitride, and a composite nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the method for manufacturing the thin film according to the present invention, it is possible to grow the thin film in a state where impurities and physical defects are not generated in the thin film and an interface between the thin film and the substrate.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> describe a method for manufacturing a thin film according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor substrate, e.g., a silicon substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber. Silicon dangling bonds that are not combined with silicon atoms exist on the surface of the silicon substrate loaded in the reaction chamber after a preliminary heating process used for forming a thin film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, oxygen, carbon, or hydrogen atoms combine with the silicon dangling bonds. As a result, the surface of the silicon substrate can be contaminated by impurities. The carbon and hydrogen atoms preferably come from the ambient air or from the CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>used in a thin film fabrication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Impurities such as oxygen, carbon, or hydrogen atoms, existing on the interface of the silicon substrate, then become initial seeds for generating physical defects in the thin film and the interface of the thin film and the substrate when growing the thin film. Therefore, the defect density of the overall thin film can be lowered by reducing the amount of these initial impurities. Accordingly, prior to the formation of the thin film, the surface of the silicon substrate should be put into an optimal condition, in which the thin film may be homogeneously grown on the surface of the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the silicon dangling bonds are saturated by flushing them with oxygen atoms or nitrogen atoms to terminate the dangling bonds with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms, so that the thin film can be homogeneously grown on the surface of the silicon substrate. In other words, when an oxide and nitride film is deposited over the silicon substrate in a subsequent process, the bonds on the top surface of the substrate will be terminated by either oxygen or nitrogen, depending upon what gas is used for flushing the substrate. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substrate is shown to be terminated by oxygen atoms for illustrative purposes only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By use of an oxygen or nitrogen saturation, the carbon or hydrogen atom that had combined with the silicon dangling bonds as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are exchanged for oxygen or nitrogen atoms. As a result, substantially all of the silicon dangling bonds are combined with either an oxygen or nitrogen atom, and so the silicon dangling bonds are uniformly combined with oxygen or nitrogen atoms on the surface of the silicon substrate. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms displace the carbon and hydrogen atoms because a bonding force between an oxygen or nitrogen atom and a silicon atom is stronger than the bonding force between a carbon or hydrogen atom and a silicon atom, as shown in Table 1. In other words, a bonding energy between a silicon atom from the substrate and a specific atom is larger than the bonding energy between the carbon atom that comes from the ligand (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and the atom comprising the substrate.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the surface of the silicon substrate is uniformly terminated by a single atom type, e.g., oxygen atoms, the surface of the silicon substrate becomes homogeneous. Accordingly, this prevents the generation of impurities and physical defects in the thin film and the interface of the thin film during a subsequent process, an allows for the formation of a homogeneous thin film. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms used for termination can be contributed to oxidation and nitrification as the second reactant, e.g., H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O supplied in a subsequent step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> first reactant, for example, trimethylaluminum (TMA) Al(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is supplied to the reaction chamber into which the terminated silicon substrate is loaded. Then, the reaction chamber is purged to remove any physically adsorbed first reactant, i.e., adsorbed reactant with a lower bonding energy. By doing so, only a chemically adsorbed first reactant is left on the silicon substrate, i.e., an adsorbed reactant with a higher bonding energy. Amounts of the remaining chemically-bonded first reactant CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>exist in various forms such as a Si&mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>radicals or a Si&mdash;O&mdash;Al&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a second reactant, for example, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O is then injected into the reaction chamber including the silicon substrate onto which the first reactant is chemically adsorbed. The TMA reacts with the H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O to form Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and CH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Then, the reaction chamber is purged to remove any physically adsorbed second reactant. By doing so, a solid thin film such as Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and an intermediate reactant such as a CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>radical are formed by the chemical exchange or the reaction between the chemically adsorbed first reactant and second reactant. Here, the Si&mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>radical is removed by injecting and purging the second reactant, and the CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is removed by evaporation. Accordingly, a stable surface having a form of Si&mdash;O&mdash;Al&mdash;O is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a dense interface is formed on the silicon substrate without impurities such as carbon and hydrogen atoms and the physical defects that would result from these impurities. Since the aluminum oxide film which continuously grows is deposited with a uniform underlayer, the density of the impurities and defects is lowered. In other words, since the state of an underlayer for every reactant is uniform in a surface reaction process performed by a ligand exchange due to the chemical absorption and the chemical reaction of reactants, the density of the thin film is high and the density of impurities and defects is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Here, a processes of forming a thin film using the method manufacturing the thin film according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> schematically shows an apparatus for manufacturing a thin film used for the thin film manufacturing method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart for describing the thin film manufacturing method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Initially, in this method, after loading the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, e.g., a silicon substrate, into a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the temperature of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is maintained at a temperature of preferably about 120 to 370&deg; C., more preferably about 300&deg; C., using a heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). In order to maintain the temperature of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at about 300&deg; C., the temperature of the heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is preferably maintained at about 350&deg; C. In addition, a further step of removing an impurity layer adsorbed or formed on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> before loading the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be further included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The surface of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is terminated by nitrogen or oxygen atoms as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by flushing nitrogen gas or oxygen gas into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from a gas source <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by selectively operating a valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and using a first gas line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or a second gas line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a maintained processing temperature of about 120 to 370&deg; C. (step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). The surface of the silicon substrate can be more effectively terminated by repeatedly injecting the nitrogen gas or the oxygen gas at least two times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If the surface of the silicon substrate is not terminated by nitrogen or oxygen atoms at a temperature of 120 to 370&deg; C., both the silicon and the CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>radicals of the subsequently supplied first reactant are not decomposed. Accordingly, carbon impurities will exist on the silicon substrate. Hydrogen impurities remain on the silicon substrate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, e.g., Al(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(TMA), is then continuously injected from a first bubbler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for preferably about 1 millisecond to 10 seconds, more preferably, for about 0.3 seconds (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably injected using a bubbling method. In other words, an inert gas, e.g., argon (Ar), of about 200 sccm (standard cubic centimeters) is preferably injected as a carrier gas from the gas source <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into the first bubbler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is preferably maintained at 20 to 22&deg; C. As a result, the first liquid reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is changed into a gas state and the first gas reactant is injected through a first gas line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a shower head <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by selectively operating the valves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the first gas line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, the pressure of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably maintained to be about 1 to 5 Torr. Supplying the first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in this manner, the first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is of about atomic size, is chemically adsorbed into the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In addition to the chemically-adsorbed first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a certain amount of the first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will also be physically adsorbed on the substrate, over the chemically adsorbed first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The physically adsorbed first reactant is then removed, preferably by purging 400 sccm of nitrogen gas from the gas source <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> preferably for about 0.1 to 10 seconds, more preferably for about 0.9 seconds, by selectively operating the valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> leading to the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using the first gas line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or the second gas line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). This purging operation is preferably performed with the processing temperature of about 120 to 370&deg; C. and a processing pressure of about 1 to 5 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A second reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, e.g., deionized water contained in a second bubbler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is then injected into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> containing the substrate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, through the gas line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the shower head <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for about 1 millisecond through 10 seconds, more preferably, for about 0.5 seconds, by selectively operating the valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). This second injection operation is preferably carried out with a processing temperature of about 120 to 370&deg; C. and a processing pressure of about 1 to 5 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the second reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is also injected by a bubbling method similar to that used with the first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Namely, the second liquid reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is changed into a gaseous form by injecting an inert gas, e.g., argon (Ar), into the second bubbler <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The inert gas, which is used as a carrier gas for the gas source <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, is preferably at about 200 sccm and is preferably maintained at a temperature of about 20 to 22&deg; C. The second reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, in gaseous form, is then injected through a third gas line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the shower head <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. At this time, the pressure of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably maintained to be about 1 through 5 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> By injecting the second reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>are formed by the chemical exchange or the reaction between the chemically adsorbed first reactant <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second reactant <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In other words, the combination of Al and CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>forms an Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>radical and an CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>radical by reaction with H2O. The CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>radical is then removed during the subsequent purging process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The physically adsorbed second reactant and any intermediate reactants are then removed by purging the reaction chamber with 400 sccm of nitrogen gas from the gas source <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for about 0.1 to 10 seconds by selectively operating a valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>). This is preferably done with a processing temperature of about 120 to 370&deg; C. and a processing pressure of about 1 to 5 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is then determined whether a thin film has an appropriate thickness (generally about 10 &angst; to 1,000 &angst;) (step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). If the film does not have an appropriate thickness, the process of injecting the first and second reactants (steps 110 to 125) is repeated. When the thin film is determined in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to have an appropriate thickness, the cycle is not repeated and the processing temperature and the processing pressure of the reaction chamber are returned to normal levels without repeating the above process (step <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, the processes of manufacturing the thin film is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An aluminum oxide film Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be formed when the first and second reactants are chosen to be Al(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(TMA) and deionized water H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, respectively.
