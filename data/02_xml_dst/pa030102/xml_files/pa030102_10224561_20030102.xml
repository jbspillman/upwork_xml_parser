<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a flash memory cell and method of manufacturing the same. In particular, the present invention relates to a flash memory cell and method of manufacturing the same in which a circular hole is formed in an insulating film formed on a silicon substrate and a cylindrical floating gate is formed within the hole, thus improving the integration degree of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, the non-volatile memory device finds a variety of application. A lot of study has been made to a mass storage memory that is one of them since it is superior to the magnetic mass storage means such as a hard disk, a floppy disk etc. in view of power consumption, size and operating speed etc. However, a study on the magnetic mass storage means has been developed to a level having a Giga byte memory capacity, while the nonvolatile memory has been developed to a level a 64M, 256M byte memory capacity. Therefore, in order to develop a non-volatile memory device having more memory capacity than the magnetic mass storage means, it is a prerequisite that the size of the chip has to be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The flash memory device that is one of these non-volatile memory devices has the function of electrical program and erase, and the memory cell of the flash memory device may be classified into a stack type and a split type depending on what type of gate electrode they have. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A conventional flash memory cell having the stack-type gate electrode will be explained by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the conventional flash memory cell has a gate electrode in which a tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a floating gate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a dielectric film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a control gate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are stacked on a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which a field oxide film (not shown) is formed, wherein source and drain <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B into which impurities are injected are each formed on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on both side of the gate electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the conventional flash memory cell constructed as above, upon a program, erase or read operation, respective bias voltages are applied to the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control gate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the source and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, respectively. The control gate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> used as a word line and the drain <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B connected to the bit line, are constituent elements necessary to select one of the memory cells. Also, the source <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A is used as a current supply. Therefore, upon all the operations including program, erase and read, the source <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A and the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected to the ground. Due to these operational characteristics, in the conventional flash memory device, the source <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A occupies about 20% of the area in unit cell. Therefore, in order to reduce the size of the device, the area of the source <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A has to be reduced. However, there is limit reduce the area of the source <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A using the current technology. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Here, for easy understanding of the present invention, the characteristic portions of the present invention will be explained by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The flash memory cell according to the present invention includes a single junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed on a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> cylindrically formed on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> wherein a portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> inserted into the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of a cylindrical shape. The floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an annular sidewall extending between a lower annular end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>proximate to the junction area, and an upper annular end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>remote therefrom. The lower annular end and the upper annular end are open in the sense that the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a tubular structure with both ends of the tube being open, the hollow portion of the tubular structure being substantially occupied by the control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 3</cross-reference>. The floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is electrically separated from the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is also electrically separated from the control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by the dielectric film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The flash memory cell constructed as above has the function of program, erase and read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Upon a program operation, a voltage of &minus;6 through &minus;15V is applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As the voltage is applied, electrons emitted from the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> due to the voltage difference between the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are injected into the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus, a selected memory cell is programmed by this F-N tunneling effects. At this time, the voltage level of the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about &minus;3 through &minus;8V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Upon an erase operation, a voltage of &plus;6 through &plus;15V is applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As the voltage is applied, electrons injected into the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> due to the voltage difference between the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are moved to the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Thus, the selected memory cell is erased by this F-N tunneling effects. At this time, the potential of the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about &minus;1 through &plus;0.5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The read operation is performed when a bias voltage relatively higher than the voltage applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is applied to the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. At this time, a deep depletion area is formed in the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the portion overlapped with the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which causes to flow a Band to Band Current. When measuring this phenomenon by use of a general transistor, this can be shown as variations in the drain current ID depending on the Gate Sweep of the Negative, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In other words, upon a read operation, the voltage applied to the junction area <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, i.e. the drain voltage VD is 3V. If the memory cell is programmed, the potential of the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about &minus;8V and at this time the drain current ID is about 100 nA. Also, if the memory cell is erased, the potential of the floating gate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is about 0V and at this time the drain current ID is about 1 pA. Therefore, it has been found that the state of the memory cell can be read by sensing the drain current ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, it forms the circular hole in the insulating film formed on the silicon substrate, forms the floating gate having a cylindrical shape within the hole and forms the control gate within the floating gate. With this method, the source used as a current supply and the silicon substrate may be formed integratedly, and also the process of forming a device separation film can be omitted. Thus, the present invention has the advantages that it can reduce the size of the device by 60% compared to that of the convention device, thus allowing manufacturing an ultra high integration non-volatile memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described and illustrated herein with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<claim-text>forming first and second insulating films on a silicon substrate and patterning the second and first insulating films to form a hole so as to expose a first portion of the silicon substrate; </claim-text>
<claim-text>forming a tunnel oxide film on the silicon substrate exposed within the hole and then forming a floating gate on a side wall of the hole while still leaving part of said first portion of the silicon substrate exposed; </claim-text>
<claim-text>injecting impurities into the silicon substrate exposed within the hole to form a junction area, and then forming a dielectric film on the floating gate; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>depositing polysilicon on the entire upper surface so that the hole can be buried and then patterning the resultant to form a control gate. </claim-text>
