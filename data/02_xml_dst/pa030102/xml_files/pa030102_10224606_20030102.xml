<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an optical storage device, and more particularly to a magneto-optical disk drive having an optical head and a magnetic head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A magneto-optical disk drive is required to become higher in recording density year after year, and various methods have been developed for recording of information in a magneto-optical disk drive. According to an optical modulation method adopted by the ISO standard, a laser beam is modulated by data to be recorded as applying an external magnetic field in a fixed direction, thereby recording information on a magneto-optical recording medium. In this optical modulation method, a recording density of information is limited by the size of a beam spot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In contrast, a magnetic field modulation method such that an external magnetic field is modulated by data to be recorded as directing a laser beam having a fixed intensity is considered to have an advantage in high-density recording over the optical modulation method, because a beam spot can be overlapped. The external magnetic field is modulated at a high speed by data to be recorded, and a contact type or flying type magnetic head is therefore used as the magnetic head. The shape and operation principle of the magnetic head in the magneto-optical disk drive are substantially the same as those of a magnetic head used in a magnetic disk drive or a magnetic tape drive. In the flying type, the magnetic head flies a height of about 10 &mgr;m above the magneto-optical disk being rotated, and records data in the beam spot. It is considered that there is a large chance of use of a magnetic head also in an optical modulation type magneto-optical disk drive with the advance of high-density recording and reproduction in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The following problems are considered in using a magnetic head in a magneto-optical disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a first problem, the magnetic head is difficult to handle as compared with an electromagnet bias used in a conventional optical modulation type magneto-optical disk drive, because the magnetic head flies a height of about 10 &igrave;m above the disk. In particular, it is greatly important to provide means for preventing breakage of the magnetic head due to the contact between the magnetic head and a portable disk or disk cartridge. Conventionally provided is means for lifting the magnetic head or means for retracting the magnetic head outside the disk to prevent the contact between the magnetic head and the disk cartridge in inserting/ejecting the disk cartridge into/from the disk drive. However, there is no special means for preventing breakage of the magnetic head when the disk cartridge is present in the disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A second problem is that the magnetic head is located opposite to the optical head with respect to the disk. In the conventional disk drive, the magnetic head and the optical head are fixed to the same carriage and moved together. Accordingly, a carriage portion for a magnetic head assembly including a load beam must be set longer than a data region of the disk. In the case of retracting the magnetic head outside the disk to prevent breakage of the magnetic head, the carriage must therefore be moved to a considerably deep position in the disk drive, so that an installation space for optical components in the disk drive is reduced. Accordingly, the disk drive as an optical storage device becomes large in size. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an optical storage device having means for preventing breakage of a magnetic head when an optical storage medium is present in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an optical storage device which can prevent a reduction in installation space for optical components due to the movement of a carriage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The optical storage device further includes an unloading mechanism for holding the magnetic head in its lifted condition above the optical storage medium in reproducing data. Preferably, the magnetic head is lifted at a position outside of the optical storage medium or at an innermost circumferential portion of the medium. </paragraph>

When the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is further inserted into the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, the roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is pushed by the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to move in an obliquely extending portion of the guide groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and simultaneously open the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> through the shutter opening member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the direction S against a biasing force of the shutter spring <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. When the roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> reaches a longitudinally extending portion of the guide groove <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> continuing from the obliquely extending portion, the roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> comes to engagement with the notch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thus fully opening the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is defined a gap G between each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> fixed to the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the shutter opening member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so as to prevent interference of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head lifters <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> during insertion of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is further inserted from the condition shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> urges the rollers <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the eject arm <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to reach a fully inserted condition shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At this time, a lock mechanism (not shown) for a spindle motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> located below the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is unlocked to lift the spindle motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and chuck the magneto-optical disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is powered on, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In recording information on the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are energized to move the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the radially outward direction of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby canceling the lifted condition of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> established by the magnetic head lifters <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> flies a given height above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> owing to an air flow generated by the rotation of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thus obtaining a condition that information recording is allowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In recording information, both the semiconductor laser (LD) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are driven simultaneously. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is reflected at right angles by the beam raising mirror <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and then focused onto the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the objective lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At this time, an external magnetic field is applied by the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> magnetically modulated to form a recorded mark on the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In recording information, the coils <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are energized simultaneously to thereby simultaneously move the first carriage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and control the seek operations of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to a target recording track of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In any operational condition other than in information recording, the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is not used, and it is therefore held in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to prevent breakage of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to collision. That is, in inserting/ejecting the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in reproducing information, or during standby, the coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are energized to move the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the radially inward direction of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the engaging member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> rides on the inclined surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and then comes to rest on the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, thereby retaining the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of the magnetic head lifters <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from being damaged by the collision therebetween due to an impact load or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In ejecting the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lowered by a mechanical or electrical mechanism (not shown) as maintaining the lifted condition of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of the magnetic head lifters <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Then, the eject arm <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is pivotally moved in the counterclockwise direction as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> by the biasing force of the torsion coil spring <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, thereby ejecting the magneto-optical disk cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A. At this time, the roller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is returned to its initial position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by the cartridge eject spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Further, the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is closed by the shutter spring <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This preferred embodiment is characterized in one aspect in that the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are driven independently of each other. Furthermore, the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is provided with means for lifting and retaining the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at an innermost circumferential portion thereof. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the stroke S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of movement of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is set longer than the stroke S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of movement of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the inner circumferential side of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

When the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seeks to such an inner circumferential position beyond the movable range of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the engaging member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is gradually lifted by the inclined surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and then retained by the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to thereby hold the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference character L denotes a distance between the rear end of the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when it is moved to the outermost circumferential side (the outer limited position defined by the stopper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) and the front end of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> when the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is moved to the innermost circumferential side (the inner limited position defined by the stopper <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). This distance L can be reduced over the corresponding distance in the conventional configuration where an optical head and a magnetic head are mounted on the same carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, reference numerals <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> denote a space for installing optical components. Since the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are driven independently of each other in this preferred embodiment, the installation space for optical components can be made larger by the hatched area <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>B than that of the conventional disk drive. As a result, the magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A in this preferred embodiment can be reduced in planar size and thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic plan view of a magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, the magnetic head lifter portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is formed at a position deeper than that of the front end of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> fully inserted in the disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B. Accordingly, there is no possibility of collision between the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the magnetic head lifter portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> during insertion of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The other configuration of the second preferred embodiment is similar to that of the first preferred embodiment, so the description thereof will be omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic plan view of a magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, omitted parts are similar to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The third preferred embodiment is similar to the first preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with the exception that a voice coil motor (VCM) for driving a second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; is made compact so as to fall inside the window (opening) <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Substantially the same parts as those of the first preferred embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals with primes (&prime;) added. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with a recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. This recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> defines an opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. A pair of guide rails <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; are fixed to the recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by securing a stopper <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>&prime; and a leaf spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; to the recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> by means of a screw <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime;. The cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed of a magnetic material such as iron, so that a pair of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; are magnetically attached to the opposite side walls of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A pair of top yokes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; are respectively provided aside the pair of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;. Each top yoke <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; is bent at its opposite ends and magnetically attached to the corresponding permanent magnet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;. Each side wall of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> forms a back yoke. Thus, the back yokes <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;, and the top yokes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; constitute a pair of magnetic circuits. A magnetic head assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is fixed to the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime;. The second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; has a pair of coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; at positions corresponding to the pair of magnetic circuits. The magnetic circuits and the coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; constitute a voice coil motor (VCM). By passing a current through the coils <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime;, the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; is moved in the radial direction of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as being guided by the pair of guide rails <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The operation of the third preferred embodiment is similar to that of the first preferred embodiment. That is, when the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seeks to an inner circumferential position beyond the movable range of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the engaging member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is gradually lifted by the inclined surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and then retained by the horizontal surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of each magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to thereby hold the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> According to this preferred embodiment, the drive means (VCM) for the magnetic head assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is configured so as to fall within the window (opening) <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a vertical space H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>) occupied by the VCM for the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> above the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be reduced over a vertical space H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in the first preferred embodiment, thereby realizing a magneto-optical disk drive having a smaller size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic plan view of a magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, omitted parts are similar to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This preferred embodiment is configured by 180&deg; rotating the magnetic head assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and mounting it on the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> That is, the magnetic head assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is mounted on the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is positioned on the outer circumferential side of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the fixed portion of the load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is positioned on the inner circumferential side of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. With this configuration, the magnetic head assembly <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is not projected outside from the outermost circumference of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that a wider space <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>A&prime; for installation of optical components and circuit components can be ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seeks to an inner circumferential position of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> beyond the movable range of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> rides on an edge <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> defining an opening as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference>, and the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is accordingly held in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, this preferred embodiment can eliminate the engaging member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic plan view of a magneto-optical disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E according to a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, omitted parts are similar to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this preferred embodiment, a load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is mounted on the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the longitudinal direction of the load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is perpendicular to the direction of movement of the second carriage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; has a front end portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending beyond the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The front end portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponds to the engaging member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the first preferred embodiment. A magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is fixed to the lower surface of the cartridge holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is formed with a pair of inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at positions corresponding to the inner circumferential position and the outer circumferential position of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inserted in the disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seeks to the inner or outer circumferential position of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> beyond the movable range of the optical head <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the front end portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the load beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; is gradually lifted by one of the inclined surfaces <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the magnetic head lifter <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, so that the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is held in the lifted condition above the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the magnetic head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be held in the lifted condition at any one of the inner circumferential position and the outer circumferential position of the disk <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in this preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, there is shown a timing chart in the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows a timing chart in the prior art for comparison. The operations of the spindle motor and the optical head in the present invention are similar to those in the prior art. That is, the spindle motor is in rotation during data reading, data writing, and idling. The tracking of the optical head is on during data reading and data writing, and is off during idling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the tracking of the magnetic head in the present invention is on only during data writing. Accordingly, during cartridge insertion, cartridge ejection, data reading, idling, and sleeping, the magnetic head is held in the lifted condition above the disk. Further, in the present invention, the loading of the magnetic head is performed always during rotation of the disk, so that there is no possibility of contact of the magnetic head and the disk. This type of loading is referred to as dynamic loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the magnetic head is held in the lifted condition above the disk by mechanical means only during cartridge insertion and cartridge ejection. More specifically, (A) shows a condition where coils for driving the carriage are not energized, but the spindle motor is in rotation to give a positive pressure from the rotating disk to the magnetic head, thereby flying the magnetic head. (B) shows a condition where the rotation of the spindle motor is stopped and the magnetic head comes into contact with the disk surface. (C) shows a condition where the magnetic head is sufficiently lifted above the disk surface by the mechanical means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the above description, the present invention can eliminate the risky conditions (A) and (B) mentioned above in the prior art, thereby improving the reliability of the magneto-optical disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Having thus described specific preferred embodiments of the present invention applied to an optical disk drive having a flying type magnetic head, the present invention is not limited to the above preferred embodiments, but it is applicable also to an optical disk drive having a contact type magnetic head. Further, there is a large chance that an optical disk drive adopting an optical modulation method may include a magnetic head with the advance of high-density recording and reproduction. Accordingly, the present invention is applicable also to such an optical modulation type optical disk drive using a magnetic head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the optical disk drive is provided with means for holding the magnetic head in the lifted condition above the disk surface at a position outside the data region of the disk at all times except when operating the magnetic head. Accordingly, the risk of breakage of the magnetic head when the disk is present in the disk drive can be reduced to thereby improve the reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, the second carriage on which the magnetic head is mounted is located on the cartridge holder. Accordingly, it is not necessary to increase the thickness of the cartridge holder to ensure a space for installation of the drive mechanism for the magnetic head, but the drive mechanism for the magnetic head can be installed on the cartridge holder or in a free space below the cartridge holder, thereby reducing the thickness of the disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Further, the mechanism for moving the optical head and the mechanism for moving the magnetic head are separated from each other. Accordingly, it is not necessary to retract the carriage on which the magnetic head is mounted toward the rear side of the disk drive, so that an installation space for optical components can be sufficiently ensured to thereby allow a size reduction of the disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the details of the above described preferred embodiments. The scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and all changes and modifications as fall within the equivalence of the scope of the claims are therefore to be embraced by the invention. </paragraph>
