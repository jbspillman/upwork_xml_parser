<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to supporting elements within a vehicle. More specifically, the invention relates to a support for a vehicle engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typically, a snowmobile is powered by a two-stroke engine, which can cause large amounts of vibration. In order to decrease the amount of vibration from the engine to the chassis, typically, such engines were supported by an engine mount attached to the bottom of the engine in a way that enabled bolts with position-adjustable dampers to be placed between the engine mount and the chassis. However, such conventional engine mounts required relatively large amounts of space within the chassis for the engine and to provide the space needed to position the adjustable dampers. Also, conventional engine mounts require more space in the chassis at the front and rear of the engine. Further, previous engine mount dampers were designed to work most effectively against movement of the engine in the direction of movement of the vehicle and in the direction of the height of the vehicle, which in some situations is not the preferred direction for accommodating and damping forces such movements generate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need for a new engine mount that can be used in a vehicle, such as a snowmobile, where the chassis has less available space for both the engine and for such an new engine mount. There is also a need for an engine mount that can be more easily assembled and accessed during production and repair activities and that can effectively reduce movement in a direction lateral to the direction of travel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a portion of a vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a snowmobile, is illustrated, including a section of a chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and an engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> coupling the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> both secures the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and damps vibration generated by the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The goal is to have the amount of vibration transferred from the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reduced to acceptable levels. The engine mount can include a base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and damping mounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is described herein with respect to a snowmobile, it should be understood that engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be used with other vehicles where engines are mounted, as well as with non-vehicle equipment having an engine. Also, although engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is described as supporting an engine, the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be used to support other devices other than engines, especially if there exists a need to reduce vibration between the supported part and another part connected thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the snowmobile chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can include a tunnel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The chassis also can include a pyramid-shaped upper support structure or &ldquo;superframe&rdquo; <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> positioned on top of the tunnel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The tunnel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and superframe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are described in more detail in U.S. Patent Application No. <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. The forward portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the chassis can include the engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, into which engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be positioned and supported. The chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can have a longitudinal (X-) axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> oriented to extend in the direction of forward and rearward travel of the snowmobile <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a transverse (Y-) axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> oriented to extend substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and transverse to the direction of forward and rearward travel of the snowmobile <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or apron can be of any appropriate construction and can include an inclined-front wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, an inclined rear wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a floor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending between front and rear walls <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be enclosed on the left side by exterior support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and on the right side by interior support wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Exterior support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can form part of the exterior side of the chassis and can include reinforcing panels for increased strength, if necessary. Interior support wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can extend within engine cradle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and between and rigidly attached to inclined front and rear walls <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. Exterior support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can have front and rear holes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, respectively, extending therethrough. Likewise, interior support wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can have front and rear holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, respectively, extending therethrough. Holes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can receive fasteners, such as bolts <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, that extend through the support walls <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and into the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for attaching the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be any of a variety of engine types. For example, engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be a two-stroke engine, such as those used for powering some snowmobiles or it can be a larger, more powerful engine for other vehicles. The illustrated engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a top <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a bottom <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a front <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a rear <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and a crankshaft <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also have fasteners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extending down from the bottom <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for attachment with the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. For example, fasteners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can be threaded bolts or similar fasteners that protrude from the bottom of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, pass through the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and are fastened to the base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by securing fasteners, such as threaded nuts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Of course, the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be adapted to receive fasteners as a female part rather than as a male part, as illustrated, or other forms of fasteners can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, can be oriented along the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. That is, the crankshaft <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> can be substantially parallel to the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The crankshaft <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> can be coupled to the driven shaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that drives the track <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> beneath the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described in the commonly assigned applications mentioned above, which are incorporated by reference, along with the commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 60/236,739 for IN-LINE FOUR STROKE SNOWMOBILES, filed Oct. 2, 2000, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The connection between crankshaft <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and driven shaft <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can, for example, be made by a driving pulley <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, a transmission, and a driven pulley <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by a belt <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The belt can be oriented substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a middle or body portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, having a top <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a bottom <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, that has four hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provided at the corners of the middle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are cylinders. It should be appreciated, however, that the hollow portions may be formed in other shapes, such as polygonal or combinations of linear and curvilinear sides. The hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed as cylinders as the engine mount is extruded in a preferred embodiment and the cylindrical shape is more easily extruded than, for example, polygonal shapes. It should also be appreciated that hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be formed as a single hollow portion and hollow portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be formed as a single hollow portion. The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides two sets of coaxial hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to eliminate the material between the hollow portions and reduce weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Cylinders <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> have a common axis <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is substantially parallel to the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Cylinders <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can have a common axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that is likewise substantially parallel to the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> but spaced from axis <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and on the opposite side of transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from axis <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be and preferably is a unitary, one-piece integrally formed element made from any appropriate material. For example, base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be formed from aluminum, steel, reinforced plastic material, other manmade materials, other metals, or combinations thereof. Also, base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be formed from a plurality of structural elements that are appropriately connected, such as by welding. The engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can made from various materials and processes including an aluminum extrusion forming a unitary element or welded from multiple parts made from other metals, including, for example, steel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The middle portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be shaped to conform to the bottom design of engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and can take any shape that permits the top surface of base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to adequately attach to the element being supported, such as engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or another element such as an intermediate member between engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment between base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can take a variety of forms, including threaded bolt depending from below the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Bolts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can extend through associated openings <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provided in base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have been sized to permit fasteners <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to extend completely therethrough and be secured by nuts on the bottom side <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of base plate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other fastening techniques, including bolts passing upwardly through base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and into threaded holes in the engine block, could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As would be known to one skilled in the art, hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> could be separated such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) illustrates hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> attached to a separate middle portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and hollow portions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attached to another middle portion <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. It would be appreciated also that hollow portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> could be placed on a separate middle portion than <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as well as having all four hollow portions <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> each individually separated with it own separate base portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 11</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, each damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can include a threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and a resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> positioned therebetween. Although the mounting and connection arrangement of each cylinder <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> does not necessarily have to be identical to the other, base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is described herein as having four substantially identical damping mounts, with one damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to each cylinder <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Consequently, only one will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and an axial extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that are construction as an integral, single element. Of course, socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be formed from multiple elements. Socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be formed from metallic material such as steel, aluminum, reinforced plastic material, other manmade materials, other metals, or combinations thereof. Flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably annular and has a substantial front surface area <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that, in use, faces the adjacent, support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The surface area <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be knurled on the face that contacts the adjacent support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to prohibit rotation when attached. The axial extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be substantially cylindrical with a threaded inner surface <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> capable of being mated with a threaded fastener <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for securing the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> also can be sufficiently long and narrow to extend within shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and an extension <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and they are preferably made as a single element. Of course, shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be formed from multiple elements. Washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be formed of metallic material such as steel, aluminum, reinforced plastic material, other manmade materials, other metals, or combinations thereof. Flange <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is preferably annular and shaped to fit against an end of one cylinder <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and can be substantially parallel to flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Extension <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can be substantially cylindrical with an inner surface <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> that has a larger diameter that the outer diameter of extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The outer surface can have an annular shoulder <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for mating with one of the inner surfaces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of cylinders <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> can have an annular surface and be sized to be press fit within any of cylinders <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The shoulder <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> engages the inner surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in a press fitting relationship to prevent the shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to and moving axially relative to the cylinder (hollow portion) in which the shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is inserted. The shoulder <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may also have a knurled surface to increase the resistance of the shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to rotation and axial movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be formed of rubber or other resilient material capable of appropriately damping vibrations emanating from engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and transmitted via plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can extend between and is preferably attached to flanges <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. However, it is only essential that there be a firm or snug fit between threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The amount of material and the type of material forming member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be selected to achieve desired damping characteristics. For example, the member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can have a main section <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> located between flanges <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, an inner section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, lying adjacent the exterior surface of extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and an outer section <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> lying adjacent the inner surface of extension <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. A gap or hollow space <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is defined between sections <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and can be open to the atmosphere in the direction away from flanges <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is preferably left open to the atmosphere, but could be filled with an resilient material, if doing so satisfied particular damping requirements of the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. This gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> can permit additional, less-damped movement in all directions except along the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. For example, the gap can have a width <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> on each side of extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> corresponding to the desired permitted movement of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This width <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> may be any dimension but can be in the range of approximately 1.80 mm to 3.50 mm, or preferably about 2.10 mm. Thus, such a width <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight> would permit a range of movement of the cylinders <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> relative to the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the direction of the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the snowmobile or in any direction in the X-Z plane. The thickness and structural features of the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will determine how much of the vibrations will be damped. The resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be bonded to both parts and it can be assembled as one part on the assembly line. One range of the hardness of a rubber resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be between 60-80 shore A durometer. An example of the rubber material that can be used within resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is black polyurethane, ASTM D2000 M2BG, G21, EF21, F17, Z1, Z2, Z3 or ASTM D2000 M2AA, 817, A13, B33, F17. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each cylinder <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has two ends where the damping mounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be placed. The damping mounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can then be sandwiched between one of the cylinders exterior end and the exterior chassis wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or the interior support wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A fastener such as a bolt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is then passed through the support wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then screwed into the threaded extension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of its respective damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, the illustrated embodiment will use four bolts <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiment of the invention facilitates the mounting of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during production in that on the assembly line, workers are standing on each side of the snowmobile <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the workers had to attach the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from above the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it would be cumbersome. With the illustrated engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the bolts <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> used to fasten the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are inserted laterally, substantially parallel to the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> making it an easy task to install the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached thereto. The engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be assembled to the bottom of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a sub-assembly production line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Ideally with engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, 100% of the vibrations can be absorbed and at the same time, have a non-adjustable engine mount <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that would keep the pulleys <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in perfect alignment. In other words, in order to achieve the best alignment of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a rigid attachment between the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is desired. One important aspect of the alignment of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is the life of the drive belt <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The life of the drive belt <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be effected by the alignment of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> moves laterally, that is, along the transverse (Y-)axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, or rotates around the height (Z-) axis, then the transmission that can be attached to the engine<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the driven pulley <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which may be fixed the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will become misaligned. Such misalignment may reduce the belt life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To obtain a certain comfort level for the driver and maintain the best alignment between the driving pulley <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the driven pulley <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> must be equipped with dampers that achieve both good vibration damping yet also maintain good alignment. The engine base plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and damping mounts <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> cooperate to ensure that desired amounts of vibration from the engine can be absorbed and at the same time suitably limit the movement of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and maintain the desired amount of alignment of engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The one damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be placed at each end of the cylinders <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that any movement of the engine along the longitudinal (X-) axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the height (Z-) axis, or in the X-Z plane, places the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in a shear force situation. Such longitudinal (X-) axis, Z-axis <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, or X-Z plane movement of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is not as significant a concern since the pulleys <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> will adjust to this change and such movement will not affect the life of the belt <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as movement along the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Any lateral movement along the transverse (Y-) axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or rotation around the Z-axis <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will result in the resilient members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> undergoing compression or tension. The alignment of the pulleys <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is very important in considering the life of the belt <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the life depends mainly on the lateral movement along the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and rotation around the Z-axis <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Also, those movements of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can correspond to the same movement of the transmission and the pulley <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. When the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> experiences such movement, it is advantageous to have resilient members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in compression since compression offers much more support than when the resilient members <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are in a shear situation. In the conventional engine mounts, the rubber was partially in shear when the engine was subjected to a lateral force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> along the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, between flanges <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and thus the damping ability of the member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be determined through testing. An acceptable thickness of resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> between flanges <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be between 8 mm and 12 mm. However, any acceptable thickness range is dependent on amount of vibration to be damped. The resilient material <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be bonded to the socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> wherever it is in contact with the mating parts <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Such bonding enables the resilient material in member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to work in shear as well as in tension. The axis of the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and its elements will be in the lateral (y-axis) direction, parallel to the transverse axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, any movement of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the transverse (Y-) axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> would put the resilient material of the member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in compression or tension on the opposite direction. Any movement in the X-Z plane, upward or downward movement along the height (Z-) axis or forward or rearward movement along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will place the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in shear since it is bonded to the socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is the amount of movement it will allow in the X-Z plane through the use of gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. The movement allowed between the shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by gap <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> can be very small, for example, approximately 2.10 mm. This can provide enough movement to absorb the vibration of the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> itself but not enough to let any outside forces, such as hard bumps from the trail, move the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> more than desired. Vibration from the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could sufficiently be damped with a thickness of the resilient member <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> as determined, as through testing. Any movement between the shoulder washer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of more than the desired amount, for example, 2.20 mm will place those two parts <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in contact and then limit additional movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is the size of the mating surface area that exists between the surface <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the sidewall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With the large flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on the end of the threaded socket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a large contact area is formed between the damping mount <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the side wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the chassis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form a more secure and rigid connection between the parts over a large surface area. For example, the flange <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can have an outermost diameter of approximately 36-38 mm. </paragraph>
