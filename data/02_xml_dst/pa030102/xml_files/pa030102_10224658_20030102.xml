<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A breast pad for absorbing fluid near a nipple is disclosed. The breast pad has an outer layer made from a substantially circular piece of absorbent material with a stitched radial tapering fold such as a dart which is deformable to a substantially concave or conical shape to substantially cover the nipple. The breast pad also has an intermediate layer of absorbing material having a shape which assists the intermediate layer to conform to an inside surface of the substantially concave shape of the outer layer. The intermediate layer is attached to the outer layer in a radial position corresponding to the stitched tapering fold such that the intermediate layer substantially covers the stitched tapering fold. In this way, the intermediate layer provides additional absorbent material near the nipple, and, prevents direct contact of the stitched tapering fold with the nipple. The breast pad also comprises an inner layer made of a hydrophilic material which dries substantially faster than the intermediate layer and draws fluid away from the nipple and towards the intermediate layer and the outer layer. The breast pad may have more than one outer layer to increase the fluid capacity of the breast. To assist in orienting the intermediate layer near the bottom of the nipple, the intermediate layer has a perceptively different color than the outer layer. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to breast pads for absorbing fluid near the nipple of a breast. More particularly, this invention relates to breast pads which have a generally concave or conical shape to substantially cover a nipple. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various types of breast pads have been used in the past to absorb fluid discharged from the nipple. In order to properly absorb the fluid near the nipple, it is generally necessary for the breast pad to have a substantially concave shape in order to fit comfortably and seamlessly around the nipple. Otherwise, if the breast pad does not have a concave shape, when the breast pad is placed over the nipple, the breast pad will create folds. The folds may irritate the nipple and may be visible through the bra and clothing of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The prior art breast pads having a concave shape have been made in substantially two manners. The first manner is by heat treating the breast pad to create the appropriate concave shape or design. However, only certain types of material can be heat-treated so as to maintain the shape after the treatment. Furthermore, the types of materials which can be heat-treated tend not to be as absorbent as other types of material which cannot be heat-treated. In particular, terrycloth and other substantially cotton-based materials, which are very absorbent, cannot be heat-treated well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The second manner for creating a breast pad having a concave shape is by sewing a &ldquo;dart&rdquo; into a substantially round material. The word &ldquo;dart&rdquo; used in this context refers to a stitched tapering fold in a garment. When a dart is sewed in a substantially circular material from the radius to the circumference of the circular material, the breast pad will then obtain a concave or conical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is apparent that a dart can be used to create a breast pad having a concave or conical shape regardless of the material used for the breast pad, and even if the breast pad is made from absorbent material. However, sewing a dart in a circular material will result in a breast pad having a seam along the dart. This seam in the breast pad may irritate the sensitive skin around the nipple. Furthermore, the stitching on the seam may act as a channel through which fluid may flow. Accordingly, while conical breast pads can be made from absorbent material by use of a dart, these breast pads suffer from the disadvantage that the seam from the dart may rub against the nipple and irritate the nipple, and may be visible through the bra and clothing of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further disadvantage of the prior art breast pads is that they can retain moisture near the nipple for extended periods of time. In other words, while the breast pad may work well to absorb fluid near the nipple, the fact that the moist breast pad continues to be in contact with the nipple may irritate the skin around the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a breast pad which has a concave shape made from absorbent materials which cannot necessarily be heat-treated, and yet does not expose the nipple to a seam caused by a dart. Furthermore, there is a need in the art for a breast pad which can keep the nipple substantially dry while still drawing fluid away from the nipple and absorbing fluid discharged from the nipple. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to at least partially overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. Also, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved type of breast pad made of an absorbent material with a dart, but preventing direct contact of the nipple with the dart. Also, it is an object of this invention to provide a breast pad which, while being absorbent, does not expose the nipple to moisture for an extended period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one of its aspects, the present invention resides in a breast pad for absorbing fluid near a nipple, said breast pad comprising: an outer layer having a fastened tapering fold causing the outer layer to be deformable to a concave shape which substantially covers the nipple; an intermediate layer of absorbent material having a shape which assists the intermediate layer to conform to an inside surface of the concave shape of the outer layer; wherein the intermediate layer is attached to the outer layer such that the intermediate layer substantially covers the fastened tapering fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention resides in a breast pad having an inner layer separating the intermediate layer from the nipple, and wherein the inner layer dries substantially faster than the outer layer. To accomplish this, the inner layer comprises a material which is hydrophilic and may be made from a tetra channel fibre. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a still further aspect, the present invention resides in a breast pad for absorbing fluid near a nipple, said breast pad comprising an outer layer of absorbent material having a fastened tapering fold causing the outer layer to be deformable to a concave shape which substantially covers the nipple, said fastened tapering fold forming a seam on an inside surface of the outer layer; an intermediate layer of absorbent material having a shape which assists the intermediate layer to conform to an inside surface of the concave shape of the outer layer; an inner layer for contacting the nipple; wherein the intermediate layer is attached to the outer layer such that the intermediate layer substantially covers the fastened tapering fold to substantially prevent the nipple from rubbing against the seam of the tapering fold through the inner layer; and wherein the inner layer comprises a material which draws fluid from the nipple to be absorbed by the outer layer and intermediate layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one advantage of the present invention is that the breast pad has a concave shape and is made from an absorbent material, such as terrycloth, however the seam from the dart is not in direct contact with the nipple. In this way, the nipple is protected from the dart by the intermediate layer. Furthermore, the intermediate layer has a shape which conforms to the inner surface of the outer layer when the outer layer has a conical shape. In this way, not only does the intermediate layer protect the nipple against the seam of the dart, the intermediate layer will not itself create folds, which folds may irritate the nipple and may be visible through the bra and clothing of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that the intermediate layer and the outer layer can both absorb fluid. In other words, the breast pad will have an intermediate layer, which may be made of an absorbent material, as well as an outer layer which may also be made of an absorbent material. In one embodiment, additional outer layers, could be used to increase absorbency. Preferably, the intermediate layer will absorb most of the moisture so that no leakage occurs through the outer layer to the clothing. To further assist in having the intermediate layer absorb fluid, it is preferred that the intermediate layer be oriented such that it is at the lower end of the breast pad when the breast pad is next to the nipple. In this way, most fluid will flow by gravity to the intermediate layer. To facilitate orienting the intermediate layer, the intermediate layer is preferably of a different colour than the outer layer so that it can be easily oriented at the bottom of the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is that the breast pad may comprise an inner layer made from a hydrophilic material which draws fluid away from the nipple and towards the intermediate layer. In this way, the inner layer performs the dual function of drawing fluid away from the nipple, thereby keeping the nipple dry, and, drawing fluid towards the intermediate layer, thereby preventing leakage from the breast pad. In the embodiment where more than one outer layer is used, the additional outer layer or layers can absorb excess fluid thereby assisting the hydrophilic material to draw fluid away from the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that, unlike other types of breast pads, the breast pad according to the present invention can be reusable. This is the case at least because the breast pad may be made from absorbent material, such as terrycloth, which can be washed and reused. In this way, the breast pad according to the present invention is substantially economical as it can be reused, and, it is environmentally friendly as compared to breast pads which are disposable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further aspects of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and drawings which illustrate the invention and preferred embodiments of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of a material which is preferably absorbent and initially has a substantially circular shape. Preferably, the diameter d of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be between four and six inches (100 and 150 millimeters), and more preferably five inches (125 millimeters). The radius r will therefore be between two and three inches (50 and 75 millimeters) and more preferably two and a half inches (37.5 millimeters). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made in the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is created by removing a sector of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then fastening, such as by stitching the sector to form a stitched tapering fold (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by reference numeral <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). In the embodiment where the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is circular, the stitched tapering fold will extend along the radius r. Preferably, the sector will extend along the circumference for a distance h of preferably one half inch (12.5 millimeters) to one and a half inches (37.5 millimeters) and more preferably one inch (25 millimeters). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Once the dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stitched along the tapering fold, the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have a fastened tapering fold which will be deformable to a substantially concave shape. In particular, in the embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> where the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from a substantially circular shape, the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have a marginally conical shape when the dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sewed. In this way, the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be deformable to a concave or conical shape which will substantially cover the nipple of the breast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of absorbent material according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will have a length <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which preferably is substantially equivalent to the diameter d of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will have a width w which is approximately equivalent to the radius r of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will preferably have centre width cw which is less than the outside width w. This is done in part so that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will have a shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which assists the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to conform to an inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the substantially concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a concave edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> intersecting a convex edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This is preferable in the embodiment where the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from a circular material so that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will conform to the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the conical shape formed by the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In particular, it is preferred that the convex edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closely follow the circumference <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been fastened, such as by sewing. In other words, when the concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is substantially conical, it is preferred that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a substantially crescent shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to conform to the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the conical shape and so that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be attached along the circumference <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once the tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is fastened, such as by stitching, the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be deformable to a substantially concave shape which covers the nipple. At this time, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be attached to the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will substantially cover the tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In other words, the centre width cw should be sufficient to substantially cover or occlude the seam of the fastened or stitched tapering fold caused by sewing or otherwise fastening the dart <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. In this way, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will provide absorbent material intermediate the nipple and the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the location of the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. This will prevent the seam of the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from contacting the nipple or, rubbing against the nipple, through an inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discussed below. Therefore, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will prevent fluid from flowing within channels formed by the seam of the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and will prevent the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from irritating the nipple by rubbing against the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To ensure that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> does not itself fold within the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably has a shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which assists the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to conform to the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forms a seamless seal of absorbent material against the nipple without any folds to irritate the nipple or act as a channel for fluid. Moreover, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> protects the nipple from the stitched tapering fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have any shape which assists the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to conform to an inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the substantially concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows particular dimensions and a crescent shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, it is understood that the invention is not restricted to an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having this particular shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Rather, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have any shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which can substantially cover the stitched tapering fold (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> by reference numeral <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) while conforming to the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the concave outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is also understood that the shape <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is the preferred shape for an outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed from a circular material and has a concave shape which is marginally conical. However, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have other shapes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, including rectangles, triangles, sections of circles, such as sectors and sections of cones. It is also understood that some of these other shapes may be more preferable in different situations, depending on the specific concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a diameter dc which closely corresponds to the diameter d of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after the stitched tapering fold has been made. The inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is designed to be in contact with the nipple and separate the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably is formed from a material which helps to draw fluid away from the nipple and towards the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed of a hydrophilic material to facilitate drawing fluid away from the nipple and towards the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such hydrophilic materials can include materials which have tetra channel fibres that draw fluid away from the nipple. The channels speed moisture along the fibres to the outer surface and the perimeter of the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Preferred examples of hydrophilic materials that have tetra channel fibres include DUPONT COOLMAX (trade mark) performance fabrics. The hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> draws the fluid away from the nipple to be absorbed, and therefore stored, in the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The fluid or moisture can be stored in the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> until the pad is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, to increase the breathability of the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will have a mesh format <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the openings will be in the range of one half to two millimeters in diameter. More preferably, the mesh format <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will have openings of about one millimeter in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Because of the hydrophilic features of the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> dries substantially faster than the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way, the hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> maintains the nipple substantially dry and separates it from the moist intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is relatively thin such that it can conform to the shape of the nipple substantially seamlessly. If any folds are created by the hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, because the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is relatively thin, these folds would be relatively small so as to substantially seamlessly contact the nipple thereby avoiding irritation. The hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> assists in drawing fluid away from the nipple and towards the absorbent intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and one or more outer layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the breast pad comprises the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having been stitched, as shown generally by the dot-dash line marked with reference numeral <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been attached to the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> substantially covers or occludes the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In this way, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will protect the nipple from the seam of the stitched or fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will preferably have the convex edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> attached along the circumference <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to ensure that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is kept in a position which substantially covers the stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the convex edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the concave edge <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will assist the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to conform to the inside surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will not itself create folds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Attached on top of the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will preferably have meshes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as described above. The inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will separate the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and also a part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the nipple. The conical shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> keeps the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> substantially in contact with the nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made from an absorbent material such as terrycloth. More preferably, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made from terrycloth having at least 94% cotton and preferably 100% cotton. Likewise, in order to further increase the absorbency of the breast pad, as well as the capacity for storing moisture, it is preferred that the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also be made from an absorbent material. Preferably, both the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are made from a terrycloth material having at least 94%, and preferably 100%, cotton. More preferably, to ensure that the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has sufficient strength to deform to and maintain the concave shape and has sufficient durability, it is preferred that the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be made from a terrycloth material having at least 18 ounces per linear meter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides a hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is in contact with the nipple and draws moisture and fluid from the nipple towards the absorbent intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably made from a thin material, and may have meshes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that it would not create large folds and substantially seamlessly contact the nipple. While the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be made of thick terrycloth material, thereby forming a relatively large seam along the fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the seam formed by the fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will be substantially covered or occluded by the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the nipple would not become irritated by rubbing against the seam of the fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the relatively thin hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In addition, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a shape such that it can conform against the inside surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also have stitching <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to attach the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. To the extent the stitching <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a seam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, this would be located circumferentially, rather than radially, and at a distance from the centre of the nipple. Radial stitching <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may extend for a short distance to ensure that all the components of the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> have been properly and reliably stitched together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In this way, the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in contact with the nipple <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to maintain the nipple dry. In addition, the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is generally made of thin material so it can substantially seamlessly contact the nipple. The conical shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and to some extent the inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, assist in maintaining the hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in contact with the nipple. To the extent that the thicker outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> protects the nipple from contacting or rubbing against the fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to avoid irritation. Furthermore, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> avoids fluid running down the seam formed by the fastened tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and either pooling at the bottom of the breast pad or flowing out from the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the combination of the hydrophilic inner material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to draw fluid away from the nipple thereby moving moisture away from the nipple to keep it relatively dry, along with the absorbent outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to absorb fluid and keep the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in contact with the nipple, as well as the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to further absorb fluid and protect the nipple from rubbing against the fastened tapering fold keeps the nipple dry and substantially prevents irritation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> absorb and hold the fluid until the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be replaced. In general, the breast will be placed adjacent an interior surface of a cup-like portion of a bra or a bra-like garment. The centre c of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will generally be placed over the woman&apos;s nipple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order to increase absorbency and fluid capacity of the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, additional layers may be used. These additional layers can be placed on the exterior surface of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and be sewn onto the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the stitching <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. These additional outer layers can be similar in construction to the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or alternatively, they may have different construction and have different dimensions as shown by reference numeral <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, both of which are collectively referred to as external outer layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. These external outer layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be used to absorb and hold additional fluid. In the case where different dimensions are used, as shown by additional outer layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, generally the diameter d&prime; and r&prime; will be larger so that it can more easily fit over the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is understood that more than one external outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> could be added, and the dimensions may be of an ever increasing diameter d&prime; or, the same diameter d as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In either case, the external outer layer will provide increased absorbency and fluid capacity. In each case, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and external outer layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, are preferably attached along the circumference <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by stitching <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> such that the hydrophilic inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can draw fluid from the nipple to be absorbed by the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and external outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is apparent that gravity will act on any fluid to cause it to flow downwards. Accordingly, it is preferred that the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> be oriented against the nipple such that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located at the bottom portion of the nipple. In order to assist in orienting the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in this manner, it is preferred that the intermediate layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a colour which is perceptively different from the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way, the portion of the breast pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> where the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached will be immediately discernible. Furthermore, if the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has meshes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the colour of the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be immediately apparent through the meshes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the inner layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is understood that while the present invention has been described and illustrated above with respect to one preferred embodiment having an outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed from a substantially circular material and deformable to a marginally conical shape, any outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having any initial shape that is deformable into a concave shape could be used. Furthermore, it is understood that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not restricted to the particular crescent shape illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Rather, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can have any shape including triangular, rectangular, square, linear, or a section of a circle or cone, such as a sector, can be used so that the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> conforms to the inside surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the concave shape of the outer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It is understood that while the disclosure has been described in terms of a stitched tapering fold <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the invention is not limited to a tapering fold which has been stitched. Rather, the invention includes all embodiments where the tapering fold has been stitched, glued, stapled or otherwise fastened together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that, although various features of the invention have been described with respect to one or another of the embodiments of the invention, the various features and embodiments of the invention may be combined or used in conjunction with other features and embodiments of the invention as described and illustrated herein. </paragraph>
