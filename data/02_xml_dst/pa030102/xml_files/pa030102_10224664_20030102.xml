<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a self-closing slide. Drawers are typically coupled to cabinets using slides. These slides are typically two-member slides or three-member slides. A two-member slide comprises an outer member and an inner member. The inner member is slidably coupled to the outer member and can telescope relative to the outer member. A three-member slide comprises three members, namely, an outer member, an intermediate member, and an inner member. The intermediate member is slidably coupled to the outer member and the inner member is slidably coupled to the intermediate member. Both the intermediate and inner member telescope relative to the outer member. Moreover, the inner member can telescope relative to the intermediate member. Typically the slide outer members are coupled to the cabinet and their inner members are coupled to either side of the drawer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The problem with many drawers is that they tend to open after they are closed. Another problem with drawers is that when they are pushed to close, they sometimes do not close completely because they are not pushed with sufficient force or alternatively they are pushed with more force than necessary causing the drawers to slam against the cabinet and then re-open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To overcome these problems some slides incorporate self-closing mechanisms that use an extension spring coupled to the outer member of the slide. The spring engages a tab or pin welded or otherwise fixed to the inner member of the slide to pull the inner member toward the outer member and close the slide. The problem with these mechanisms is that the spring is in an extended or stretched position until it is engaged by the tab or pin fixed to the inner member. As such, the spring remains stretched until the slide closes. Consequently, if the spring breaks while stretched&mdash;which a common failure mode for extension springs&mdash;it will have a tendency to eject from the mechanism creating a hazardous condition. Moreover, the tabs tend to break off from the inner member with usage due to fatigue causing early failure of the self-closing mechanism. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A self closing slide incorporating a self closing mechanism is provided. The self closing slide comprises at least two slide members. A first member of the self closing slide comprises a slot extending to an end of the first slide member. The self closing mechanism is coupled to a second slide member the self closing slide. The mechanism comprises a housing having a slot guiding an actuator. The actuator is spring coupled to the housing. The actuator can slide along the slot between a first position and a second position. The actuator can remain engaged in the first position with the spring armed. When the first member of the slide approaches a closed position, the actuator is received in the slot formed on the first member, causing the first slide member to be engaged by the actuator. As the first member continues to move toward a closed position it causes the actuator to disengage from the first position whereby the armed spring causes the actuator and the engaged first slide member to slide along the slot to the second position where the slide is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the first slide member is extended relative to the second slide member, it causes the actuator to move from the second position toward the first position. When in the first position, the spring rearms and the actuator gets engaged in the first position, while the first slide member disengages from the actuator.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Self closing slides are provided. Self-closing mechanisms are also provided that attach to slide members of the self closing slides at or proximate the members&apos; rearmost ends. For convenience, the mechanisms are described herein in relation to a three-member slide. However, the mechanisms can be incorporated into two member slides or other slides using multiple sliding members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A typical three member slide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an inner member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> slidably coupled to an intermediate member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is slidably coupled to an outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The outer member is channel shaped in cross section, i.e., it defines a channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, having web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and two legs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extending preferably perpendicularly from opposite ends of the web. A lip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends preferably perpendicularly from each leg such that the two lips extend toward each other. A bearing raceway <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is defined by each lip, its corresponding leg and the web. The intermediate slide member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, also generally channel shaped in cross-section, is slidably coupled within the outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In cross-section, the intermediate member also comprises a web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and two legs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending from opposite ends of the web. Each of the legs has a double curvature such that each leg defines an inner raceway <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an outer raceway <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The intermediate member is slidably coupled within the outer member with their &ldquo;channels&rdquo; facing in the same direction. Ball bearings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are sandwiched between the inner bearing raceways <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the outer member and the outer bearing raceways <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member. The ball bearing are typically coupled to an outer ball bearing retainer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The inner member is also channel shaped in cross-section comprising a web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> having two legs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending from opposite ends of the web. A concavity is formed on the outer surface of each leg defining an outer bearing raceway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The inner member is slidably coupled to the intermediate member with the channel of the inner member facing opposite the channel of the intermediate member. In other words, the legs of the inner member extend from the web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the inner member toward the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member. Ball bearings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are sandwiched between the outer bearing raceways <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the inner member and the inner bearing raceways <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member. The ball bearing are typically coupled to an inner ball bearing retainer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Each slide member is typically formed from a single piece of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment self closing mechanism <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the present invention comprises an elongated housing or body <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having opposing side walls <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and top wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3</cross-reference>). The housing may also have a front wall <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The width <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the top wall, i.e., the spacing between the side walls, is smaller than the width <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the slide inner member web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the inner member can slide over the housing. The housing may also have a base or bottom wall (not shown). The terms, &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; &ldquo;top,&rdquo; bottom,&rdquo; &ldquo;base,&rdquo; &ldquo;upward,&rdquo; &ldquo;downward,&rdquo; &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;front&rdquo; and &ldquo;back&rdquo; are used as relative terms and are not meant to denote the exact location of a member operated by such term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Two, but preferably four legs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>extend transversely from the base portion of the housing sides <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> In a preferred embodiment two legs extend from either side of the housing from proximate the base of the sides. Each leg comprises a first portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending laterally from a side wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the housing. Each of the legs also comprise a second portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending from the first portion inclined at an angle relative to the first portion such that the free-end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the second portion is higher than the first portion. The second portions have a height <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as measured perpendicularly to the first portion that is preferably slightly smaller than an inner height <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the inner bearing raceway of the outer member (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>B). The housing and legs are preferably integrally formed and are preferably made of plastic. In this regard, the legs are flexible allowing for the housing to be &ldquo;snapped-in&rdquo; place on the slide outer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The housing with legs is mounted within the outer slide channel at the rearmost end portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Specifically, the housing with legs is slid or &ldquo;snapped-in&rdquo; within the channel defined by the outer slide such that the free ends <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the leg second portions engage the inner surfaces of lip portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the outer slide. Consequently, the leg second portions which occupy the height <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of almost the entire inner bearing raceway fit tightly within the inner bearing raceways <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the outer member. In an exemplary embodiment, a protrusion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is formed extending from the bottom surface of the first portion of at least one leg but preferably extending from the bottom surfaces of at least two oppositely extending legs, as for example legs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>). Complementary slots <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are formed through the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the outer slide member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that when the legs are urged toward the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the protrusions <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> enter their complementary slots <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> thereby providing a more secure engagement between the housing and the slide outer member (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the housing is attached to the outer slide member, it is in the sliding path of the slide intermediate member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. To accommodate for the length of the outer member occupied by the housing, the intermediate member preferably has a length shorter than outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that when it is in the fully retracted position relative to the outer member, the intermediate member does not extend beyond the outer member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the mechanism is incorporated in a three-member slide, a stop member may extend from the front portion of the housing for stopping the travel of the intermediate member and silence an impact of the intermediate member on the housing. The stop member may be resilient material mounted on the front portion of the housing. In a preferred exemplary embodiment, the stop member is a flexing arm <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> integrally formed with the housing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and extending from one side of the housing transversely to proximate the other side of the housing. When the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the intermediate member strikes the flexing arm <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the arm flexes toward the housing to soften and silence the impact while providing a stop to the rearward travel of the intermediate member. Preferably the stop member is shorter in height than the housing and the upper surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the front portion of the housing is tapered so as to increase in height in a direction toward the rear of the housing as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. In this regard, if the inner slide member were to contact the tapered upper surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> as it slides toward a closed position, it would ramp up and over the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A guide rod also referred to herein for convenience as a &ldquo;guide pin&rdquo; or &ldquo;pin&rdquo; <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is coupled to the rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the housing and extends within the housing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The guide pin in the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and described herein is cylindrical, i.e., it has a circular cross-sectional shape. However, the pin may have other cross-sectional shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The pin is coupled to the rear wall of the housing slightly nearer one of the side walls <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is capable of pivoting relative to the rear wall. Pivoting can be accomplished by providing an opening through the rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a diameter much larger than the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> diameter. An end of the pin protrudes through the rear wall opening and is capped forming a rear cap <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a larger diameter than the opening. In this regard, the capped end is prevented from re-entering the housing and the pin is able to move sideways within the opening and thereby allowing the guide pin to pivot relative to the rear wall. In an alternate embodiment, the guide pin is allowed to exit the housing through a rear wall opening and is then bent such that the bent portion of the pin engages the outer surface <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> of the rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preventing the pin from retracting back into the housing. </paragraph>

The slot longitudinal portion extends from preferably proximate the rear wall of the housing toward the front wall <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slot extends transversely from the forward end of the slot longitudinal portion in a direction crossing the central longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the housing.

The slit is shorter than the slot and it is in communication with the slot at its rearmost end. Consequently, a flexible tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is defined between the slot and the slit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a preferred exemplary embodiment, a second slit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed on the edge of the slot longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> opposite the tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and proximate the rear end of the slot longitudinal portion. The second slit defines a flexible detent <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> which extends into the path of the slot longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The detent may have a protrusion <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> extending into the slot longitudinal portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> extends from an upper surface of the actuator and is fitted within the slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>A). In one exemplary embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>A, the guide member is in the form of a pin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The guide member and actuator are preferably integrally formed. The slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> serves to guide the guide member and thereby the actuator travel along the housing. As the actuator travels along the housing, the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> pivots relative to the housing rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to accommodate the actuator travel. When in the rear end of the slot, the pin and thus the actuator can move laterally against the tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, flexing the tine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As the actuator is moved forward along the slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, it compresses the spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> against the guide pin front cap <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. When at the front end of the slot, the actuator guide follows the curved portion of the slot and into the transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slot as the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is pivoted about the rear wall. When at that position, the spring is compressed providing a force attempting to urge the actuator in a direction toward the rear wall. The force causes the actuator guide member to engage the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defined by the transverse slot portion on the housing top wall and thereby maintain the actuator within the transverse slot portion in an &ldquo;armed&rdquo; state. The transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is of sufficient length to support the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. When the guide member is moved transversely toward the longitudinal portion of the slot, the spring force causes the actuator to move along the slot to rear end of the slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is formed on the rear end of the web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the inner slide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

The first portion of the web slot is aligned to straddle the guide member of the actuator as the inner member is slid over the housing. The web slot first portion has a first longitudinal edge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> positioned furthest from the longitudinal slot on the housing top wall. The web slot than curves in a direction toward the longitudinal slot of the top wall and forms a second inclined slot portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The second slot portion has a first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> inclined to the first edge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the slot first longitudinal portion at an angle preferably less than 90&deg;. A curved edge <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> forms the transition between the first edges of the first and second slot portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first slot portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> opposite the first longitudinal edge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends away from the first longitudinal edge to the rear end of the inner member web. The second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first web slot portion extends transversely to at least a location axially aligned with the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the housing top wall. Preferably, the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> spans a distance sufficient for engaging the actuator guide member when the actuator guide member is located within the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the housing top wall. More preferably, the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> spans transversely to a distance covering the entire width of the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the housing top wall slot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A second edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the web second slot portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> opposite the inclined first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is inclined at an angle to the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first slot portion and extends in a direction similar to the first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the second web slot portion. The point of intersection between second edge of the first slot portion and the second edge of the second slot portion is preferably rounded forming a tip <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As the inner member of the slide is retracted rearward toward a closed position, the guide member of the actuator enters the first portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. As the inner member continues to move rearward, the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> makes contact with the curved edge <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the web slot and then the first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the second slot portion. When that occurs and as the inner member further retracts, the actuator guide member is guided transversely by the first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the web slot second portion along the web slot second portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This causes the actuator guide member and thus the actuator to move transversely along the transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slot on the housing top wall and to the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the top wall slot. When that occurs, the spring &ldquo;unarms&rdquo; and the spring force causes the actuator to travel rearwards along the guide pin and the actuator guide member to travel rearward along the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the housing top wall. As the actuator guide member is moved rearwardly by the spring force, it engages and applies a force on the second edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the second slot portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the web slot causing the inner member to slide rearwardly with the guide member and the slide to self close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As the slide inner member is extended after being closed, the second edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the web slot second portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> applies a force on the actuator guide member causing the guide member to move forward along the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot on the housing top wall and against the spring force compressing the spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. When the actuator guide member reaches the front end of the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the top wall slot its longitudinal motion is stopped as the inner slide member continues to extend. Consequently, the actuator guide member begins to move rearwardly relative to the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and along the second edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the second portion of the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Thus, the actuator guide member is moved transversely relative to the housing and along the transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the top wall slot where it engages the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the housing top wall as a result of the applied spring force. As the inner member is further extended the guide member exits the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and remains &ldquo;armed&rdquo; against the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the actuator is in the rearmost position, e.g. when the slide is in a closed position, the spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which is in the exemplary embodiment is a compression spring, is in its normal extended position offering minimal or no force. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the detent <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> controls any bouncing of the slide and actuator that may occur. If the slide with actuator attempt to re-extend, i.e., &ldquo;bounce&rdquo;, from the closed position, the detent <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> which extends into the path of the slot longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> formed on the housing top wall will engage the actuator guide member and stop the re-extending travel i.e., the bounce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If the actuator guide member inadvertently disengages from the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the housing top wall and moves to the rear end of the housing by the spring force, the self closing mechanism can be re-engaged by the inner slide member. This is accomplished by retracting the inner slide member. As the inner slide member is retracted, the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the inner member web slot first portion engages the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As the inner member is further retracted, the actuator guide member is caused to move transversely along the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causing the guide member to engage and flex the tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the housing and move it transversely. When flexed, the tine provides a force against the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> tending to push the guide member toward the longitudinal slot portion. As the inner slide member continues to retract, the actuator guide member reaches and passes the tip <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the web slot at which point the force generated by the tine causes the actuator guide member to move into the second slot portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Once within the second slot portion <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the actuator guide member is engaged by the inner slide member and extension of the slide member will cause the actuator guide member and the actuator to move into an &ldquo;armed&rdquo; position as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Applicants have discovered that an incline angle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) of 34&deg; between the first edge <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the web slot second portion and the first longitudinal edge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the first longitudinal portion of the web slot to be optimum for the operation of the mechanism when the guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is cylindrical. A shallower angle may provide for smoother operation of the mechanism, but with such angle a longer second slot portion is required for moving the actuator guide member a sufficient transverse distance for disengaging from the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the housing top wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Applicants have also discovered that for optimum operation, the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first web slot portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> should extend at angle <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> preferably of about 35&deg; from an axis <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the inner member web longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> located at the rear end of the web. In addition, applicants have discovered that the second edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the second web slot portion should be inclined at an angle <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of about 95&deg; to the second edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first slot portion. Furthermore, applicants have discovered that the tip <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> between second edge of the first slot portion and the second edge of the second slot portion should be rounded to allow for smooth re-engagement of the actuator guide member if it inadvertently disengages from the slide inner member. An exemplary radius for the tip is about 0.08 inch. Moreover, applicants have discovered that a spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with a spring rate 1.2 lbs. per inch or capable of providing a force of 3 lbs. provides sufficient force for self-closing of a slide coupled to a typical kitchen drawer and cabinet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the tip <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> formed on the web slot is joggled so as to engage the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> along a lower location closer to the upper surface of the housing top wall as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. In this regard, the force applied by the tip <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the actuator guide member is reacted more in shear, and less in moment, tending to move the actuator guide member and actuator. By applying a smaller moment to the actuator guide member, more of the force applied to the actuator guide member is used to move the actuator. Consequently, a lesser force is needed to move the actuator and the motion of the actuator is smoother. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the housing has a length of about 2.465 inches; the longitudinal slot extends to a length of about 1.6 inches along the housing top wall; the inner slide member web has a width of about 0.76 inch at the rear end of the inner member; the second slot portion extends a distance of about 0.694 inch into the inner slide member web as measured from the rear end of the web; the first edge of the first inner slide member web slot portion is located at about 0.698 inch from the outer surface of the furthest leg of the inner slide member; and the rounded tip is located at about 0.519 inch from the outer surface of the furthest leg of the inner slide member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary embodiment, the actuator guide member is an elongated protrusion <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A, 7B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C). With this embodiment, the width <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the transverse portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the slot formed on the top wall of the housing should be wider than the width <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot to accommodate the increased length in the guide member. The longitudinal portion of the slot only has to accommodate the narrower width of the guide member. The increased length of the guide member protrusion provides more surface for engagement by the web slot of the inner member thereby reducing the force required to disengage the actuator guide member from the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the transverse slot <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> formed on the housing top wall. The increased length of the guide member also causes a reduction in the noise as the guide member moves across the web slot. This is due to the fact that the guide member, because of its increased length, will travel a smaller distance from one edge of the web slot before striking an opposite edge of the web slot. A front and rear perspective view of the guide member incorporated in the exemplary embodiment mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</cross-reference>, respectively. This exemplary embodiment actuator comprises a rear wall <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> for penetration by the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> has a diameter greater than the diameter of the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> but smaller than the diameter of the spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The actuator also comprises two side walls <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and no front wall. By coupling the guide pin to the actuator only via the rear wall, the actuator is allowed to pivot laterally relative to the guide pin such that central longitudinal axis of the opening <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is offset relative to the central longitudinal axis of the guide pin. This allows the actuator to have more freedom of movement relative to the guide pin making the movement of the actuator and thus of the mechanism easier. In an alternate embodiment, not shown, the actuator may have a front wall with an opening for the guide pin and no rear wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary embodiment mechanism, an alternate embodiment actuator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> is used. This embodiment guide member comprises an elongated protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is made more flexible by having two flexible longitudinally extending members <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. These members may be formed by forming a slot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> along a plane parallel to the upper surface of the protrusion that spans a portion of the length <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the protrusion and then forming a second slot <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the first slot <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extending to the upper surface <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the protrusion. The members which can flex reduce the impact noise when the actuator guide member is engaged by the web slot <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> of the slide inner member. In another exemplary embodiment, impact noise may be reduced by covering the actuator guide member, or at least the guide member protrusion, with a softer material, e.g., a rubbery material, cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When an elongated protrusion forms the guide member, as for example the guide member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> (or the guide member <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C and 7D</cross-reference>), a web slot <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is formed on the web of the inner slide member having a first portion <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> extending from the rear end of the inner member web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a second generally wider inclined slot portion <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> extending from the first portion. The second inclined portion is wider than the first portion to accommodate the elongated guide member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an alternate exemplary embodiment, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> bump or protrusion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is used in lieu of the detent <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The bump <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is formed on the edge of the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a location opposite the tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and extends within the slot portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. A complementary depression <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is formed on the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. When moving toward a closed position, i.e., rearward, the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is pushed sideways by the bump and in turns bends the tine <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. If the slide member with actuator guide member attempt to &ldquo;bounce,&rdquo; i.e., to re-extend after closing, the bump <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> would engage the complementary depression <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and suppress or stop the bounce, i.e., prevent slide extension. In yet a further alternate exemplary embodiment, a second bump <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is formed on the tine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> opposite the first bump <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The second bump also extends into the longitudinal slot portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. A second depression <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> complementary to the second bump is formed on the actuator guide member <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to accommodate the second bump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In yet another exemplary embodiment, a ramp <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may be formed on the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of transverse portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for aiding in the retention of the guide member in an &ldquo;armed&rdquo; state. The ramp may be defined by a bump <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> extending from the transverse edge <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in another exemplary embodiment, an edge <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the slot <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be slightly curved forming a concavity, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, to avoid squeaking as the actuator guide member moves along the longitudinal slot portion. Squeaking typically occurs when a plastic member slides against another plastic member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a further alternate exemplary embodiment, instead of being coupled to the rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the housing, the guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is coupled to the front wall <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the housing and is capable of pivoting relative to the front wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In an alternate exemplary embodiment self-closing mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the housing or body <highlight><bold>199</bold></highlight> has four legs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, two extending from either side wall of the housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. With this embodiment, the legs have an outer surface complementary to the inner bearing raceways <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the slide outer member for snugly interfacing with the inner bearing raceways of the inner slide member. Preferably, at least two opposite legs have protrusions <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> extending from their lower surface <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>). These protrusions engage corresponding slots <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> formed on the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for securing the housing to the outer member (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The legs are preferably integrally formed with the housing. A groove <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed through each leg to accommodate the legs <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the inner slide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</cross-reference>. In this regard, the inner slide member can slide over the housing. Preferably the groove defines surfaces <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> on the legs to interface with the outer bearing raceways <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the inner slide member. In this regard, the grooves <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> serve as a guide for guiding the inner slide member over the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the self-closing mechanism is incorporated in a three-member slide, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> stop <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may extend from the front end of the mechanism housing. The stop may be in the form of a resilient member attached to the front end of the housing or may be in the form of two arms <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, each arm extending from a side <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the housing toward the center of the housing which can flex as it is contacted by the intermediate member web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, to absorb some of the energy due to impact, silence the impact and stop the movement of the intermediate member. Alternatively, the housing may be formed with a single arm as discussed above extending from the front end of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A guide slot <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is formed in each of the two sidewalls <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the housing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. Each sidewall guide slot is a longitudinal slot extending from proximate the rear wall <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the housing to proximate to front end <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of the housing. Each slot comprises an upper edge <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The upper edge extends from proximate the rear wall of the housing to proximate the front wall of the housing. A notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper edge nearer the front wall of the housing. A first lower edge <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> extends from proximate the rear wall of the housing to a location beyond the notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> where it is stepped down to a second lower edge <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. In other words, the second lower edge is lower than the first lower edge. Consequently, each slot has a narrow portion <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> which extends into a wider portion <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A longitudinal rectangular slot <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is formed on the top wall <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the housing. A guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> extends from the inner surface <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> of the front wall <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the inner surface <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the rear wall <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the housing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>). A spring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> surrounds the pin. In other words, the pin penetrates a spring. A groove <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner surface <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> of the front wall <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the housing extending to the bottom of the front wall. The groove preferably has a flat base <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and a width which is greater than the outer diameter of the spring. A groove <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner surface of the rear wall <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight>. The groove extends from the top toward the bottom of the inner surface of the rear wall <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the groove is confined to an area within the middle of the wall and does not extend to the top or bottom ends of the rear wall. The groove <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> has a width slightly greater than the diameter of the guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The self-closing mechanism also comprises an actuator <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. The actuator comprises a body <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> having a tab <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> extending from either side of the body (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>). The tabs have a thickness that is slightly smaller that the width of slide wall slots narrower sections. An opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is formed longitudinally through the body <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is elongated in cross-section having a width <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> that is narrower than its height <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the width <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than the diameter of the guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> but smaller than the outer surface diameter of the spring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</cross-reference> the opening is stepped from a first smaller width section <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to a second larger width section <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> along the actuator body length. The first section <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> has a width greater than the diameter of the guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> but smaller than the outer surface diameter of the of the spring. The second section <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> has a width greater than the outer surface diameter of the spring. With this embodiment, the first section <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends from the rear end <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> of the body to a location <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> near the front end <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of the actuator body <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. From there the second section <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> extends to the front end <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of the actuator body. Consequently, an annular shoulder <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> is defined between the two sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A channel <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> bounded by a front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> and a rear lip <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is formed transversely across the upper surface of the actuator body <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The front surface <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> of the front lip is tapered toward the channel. The rear surface <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> of the rear lip is preferably also tapered toward the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To assemble the self-closing mechanism, the spring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is inserted over the guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, and the actuator <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is placed over the guide pin from the rear end of the guide pin such that the guide pin penetrates the actuator opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> where opening at the actuator front end <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is wider than the outer surface diameter of the spring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, the spring penetrates a portion of the actuator until it abuts the annular shoulder <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> in the actuator body. The guide pin rear end is fitted within the groove <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> formed on the inner surface of the rear wall and the guide pin forward end is fitted within the groove <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> formed on the inner surface of the front wall. The tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> extending from the sides of the actuator are slidably fitted within the guide slots <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the side walls of the housing. While the housing may have a bottom wall, in the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, the housing does not have a bottom wall. The entire self closing mechanism is then mounted on the rear most end of the slide inner member such that the foot protrusions <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> protrude through corresponding slots <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> on the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the slide outer member as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When the pin is mounted within the housing, the rear end of the pin is elevated in comparison to the front end of the pin. This is caused by the relative positioning of the grooves <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> formed on the inner surfaces of the front and rear walls of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When the guide pin, spring and actuator are mounted within the housing, the spring urges the actuator toward the rear end of the housing. To move the actuator toward the forward end of the housing, a force must be applied on the actuator to move it against the spring force longitudinally forward. Because the pin and spring are inclined, i.e., the rear end of the pin is situated higher than the front end of the guide pin, as the tabs progress beyond the first lower edges <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of the guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and into the second lower edges <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the guide slots which are lower than the first lower edges, the actuator is caused to rotate in a forward direction such that forward ends <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> of the tabs rotate downward toward the second lower edges <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of the guide slots while the rear end <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the tab engages the notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> formed on the upper edge of each of the guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. When in that position, the spring is in a compressed state and it attempting to urge the actuator toward the rear. However, the notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> formed in each of the guide slot upper edges provides a stop to such movement. Moreover, when in the rotated position, the front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the actuator is in a lower position relative to the housing top wall while the actuator rear lip <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is positioned higher relative to the housing top wall when compared to their positions prior to rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The actuator is able to rotate partially relative to the guide pin <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> because of the actuator elongated opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> penetrated by the guide pin. Moreover, some actuator rotation is allowed by the relative available movement of the front and rear ends of the guide pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To interface with a self-closing mechanism, a web slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> is formed proximate the rear end <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the inner slide member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is spaced apart from the rear end <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the web at a distance <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> that is shorter than the width <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> of the channel formed on the upper surface of the actuator (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Consequently, the strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> defined between the web slot and the end of the web has a width <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> that is shorter than the width of the channel <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> formed on the upper surface of the actuator. Furthermore, the web slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> has a width <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> which is slightly greater than the width of the front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the actuator. In this regard, the slide inner member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can engage the actuator by having the strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> positioned within the channel such that the front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> of the actuator penetrates the slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. Once the slide inner member has engaged the actuator, extension of the inner member applies a force against an inner surface <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> of the front lip of the actuator causing the actuator to travel forward against the spring force until the front ends <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> of the tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the actuator moves past the first lower edges <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of the guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, at which point the actuator rotates causing the front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> to withdraw from the web slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and release the inner slide member from the actuator. When that occurs, the actuator tab rear ends <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> remain engaged against the notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> formed on each upper edge <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the inner slide member is retracted moving rearward relative to the outer slide member, the rear end <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the web of the inner slide moves to engage an inner surface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the rear lip <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> of the actuator such that the web strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> is positioned over the actuator channel <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. As the inner member continues to move rearward, it pushes against the inner surface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the rear lip of the actuator, causing the actuator to rotate upward such that the actuator front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> penetrates the web slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, while simultaneously causing the rear end <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of each tab <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> to move downward and disengage from notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> causing the strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> to be straddled within the channel <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> between the front and rear lips of the actuator. When that occurs, the spring force urges the actuator backwards. Because the web strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> is straddled within the actuator channel, the actuator moves the slide rearward to self-close. The rear ends <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the tabs may be rounded to allow for easier disengagement from the notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, thereby requiring less force to disengage the tabs from the notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> If the actuator were to inadvertently disengage from the slide inner member web <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the mechanism provides for reengagement of the actuator by the inner slide member web. In such case, as the inner member is retracted, i.e., moves backward relative to the slide outer member, the end <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the slide inner member web engages the front tapered surface <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> of the actuator front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>. The front lip front tapered surface <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> guides the rear end <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> of the web over the front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> until the web strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> is positioned over the actuator channel at which time the actuator front lip <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> penetrates the web slot <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and the web strip <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> is straddled within the actuator channel between the front and rear lips, thereby re-engaging with the inner slide member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary embodiment, ramp surfaces <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> may be formed extending from the first lower edges <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of the side wall guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> inward, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. These ramp surfaces are co-extensive with the first lower edges. In other words, the ramp surfaces do not extend longitudinally beyond the first lower edges <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of the side wall guide slots <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The ramp surfaces provide support to for the actuator tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. With this embodiment, the actuator tabs do not have to extend transversely to the first lower edges of the sidewall guide slots. They only have to extend to the ramps such that they are sandwiched between the ramp surfaces and the housing top wall. When the front ends <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> of the actuator move forward past the front end of the guide slot first lower edges, they move past the ramp surfaces <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> and are able to rotate forward as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In an alternate exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, the guide pin is eliminated. With this embodiment, the housing is provided a bottom wall <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>). A central longitudinal slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is formed along the bottom wall. A spring <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is fitted within the central longitudinal slot. The slot has a width <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> slightly greater than the outer surface diameter of the spring. An intermediate wall <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> parallel to the bottom wall <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is formed between the top wall <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and bottom wall <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the housing. A central longitudinal guide slot <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is formed along the intermediate wall. The guide slot <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is parallel and axially aligned with the intermediate wall slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is provided with a bottom tab <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> extending from a bottom surface <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> of the actuator proximate the rear of the actuator body(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A, 13B</cross-reference>). The actuator also includes a pair of side tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> extending from opposite sides of the actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A guide slot <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is formed on each sidewall <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the housing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12C</cross-reference>). A notch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is also formed along the upper edge of each guide slot <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Immediately forward of the notches a cutout <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is formed across the intermediate wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Prior to mounting on the slide outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the actuator is fitted within the housing such that the side tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> are slidably fitted within the sidewall guide slots <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the bottom tab is slidably fitted within the intermediate wall slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The tab is moved toward the rear wall of the housing and the spring <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is fitted within the bottom wall slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> between the front wall <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and the actuator bottom tab <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the bottom wall is chosen to be sufficient for providing lateral support to the spring for preventing the spring from moving transversely across the housing. When the housing is mounted on the slide outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the outer member web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will retain the spring within the bottom wall slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When mounted on the slide outer member, the spring urges the bottom tab and thus the actuator toward the housing rear wall <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. When the slide inner member is engaged to the actuator and is retracted relative to the outer member, the actuator is slid forward until it reaches the cutout <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> on the intermediate wall. When the actuator reaches the cutout, the off-center force which is applied by the spring to the actuator bottom tab causes the actuator to rotate forward and the rear ends <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the side tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> to engage their corresponding notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> on the sidewall guide slots <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Forward rotation of the actuator is aided by having the bottom tab <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> extending from proximate the rear portion of the actuator body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When forward rotation of the actuator occurs, the inner slide member releases from the actuator and the force applied by the spring on the actuator bottom tab retains the actuator tabs and thus the actuator engaged to the notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> until it is re-engaged by the inner slide member and released from the notches. The rear ends <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the tabs may be rounded to allow for easier disengagement from the notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, thereby requiring less force to disengage the tabs from the notches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The bottom wall of the housing <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be provided with a pair of actuator slots <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, one on either side of the bottom wall slot <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for accommodating the side tabs <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> of the actuator when the actuator is in a rotated &ldquo;armed&rdquo; position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> With any of the embodiments of the present invention, the self-closing mechanism housing also provides lateral support to the slide inner member as it slides over the housing. Furthermore, any of the aforementioned housing may incorporate any of the legs described herein for mounting on the slide outer member. Moreover, a tab <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be cut from the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the slide outer member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for engaging the front wall <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of the housing for further securing the housing to the slide outer member as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> With any of the aforementioned embodiments, the web portion of the slide web surrounding the legs of the housing may be lanced upwards. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, a portion of the slide web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> immediately behind the housing legs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are raised i.e., lanced forming lances <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. These lances provide further support to the housing and prevent the housing from sliding backward along the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as the slide and actuator close. In yet a further alternate exemplary embodiment, the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is lanced at a location for creating a lance <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> immediately behind the housing front wall <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The lance <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> also provides support for preventing the housing from sliding backwards along the web <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as the slide is closed. In another exemplary embodiment, the portions of the web in front of the legs are also lanced. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>, lances <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed in front of the housing legs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively and opposite lances <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>respectively.

These depressions provide a predefined location for the legs to couple to the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover in any of the aforementioned exemplary embodiments incorporating a guide pin and an actuator, as for example the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 7A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the actuator opening accommodating the guide pin, as for example the opening <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> formed on the wall <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> of the actuator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, is extended to the free end <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the opening extends to the free end <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> of the wall via a slot <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> having a width that is smaller than the diameter of the opening. The width of the slot <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> should also be slightly smaller than the diameter of the guide pin. This allows for the actuator to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; on to the guide pin as for example guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In other words, the guide pin &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; through the slot <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> into the opening <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is defined between two edges <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. These edges taper outward forming tapering edges <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>, respectively, at their intersection with the free end <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> of the wall increasing the width of the slot at the free end <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> of the wall. The tapering edges <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> serve to guide the guide pin to the slot when the actuator is being &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; over the guide pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further with any of the aforementioned embodiments incorporating a guide pin, as for example the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 7A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the spring as for example spring <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is fitted over the guide pin, as for example guide pin <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the guide pin is capped at both ends, e.g., a cap is formed at each end, as for example caps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. One end of the guide pin may be capped prior to fitting the spring. If an actuator, as for example the actuator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is used, the actuator may then be &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; on the guide pin. Alternatively, the pin may be fitted within the actuator prior to capping. The guide pin with spring and actuator may then be &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; onto a wall of the housing, as for example the housing rear wall. To allow for snapping of the pin onto the housing rear wall, the rear wall of the housing, as for example wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, is formed with an opening <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> which extends to the lower end <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> of the rear wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via a slot <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> having a width that is smaller than the diameter of the opening <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the opening <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> is has an elliptical shape whose minor diameter is greater than the guide pin diameter. The elliptical shape allows for the pin slide across the opening as well as pivot about the opening. The slot <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> width is slightly smaller than the diameter of the guide pin so as to allow the pin to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; through the slot and into the opening <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Portion of the edges of the lot <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> extending to the lower end <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> taper outwards forming tapering edges <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, increasing the width of the slot <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> to a dimension greater than the diameter of the guide pin. This increase in slot width provides a guide for guiding the guide pin to the slot <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for being &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the mechanisms of the present invention are used with a three member slide, a longer intermediate slide member may be used by cutting out a portion of the web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, forming a cut-out <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> to accommodate a front portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> of the self-closing mechanism as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This would also allow use of longer ball bearing retainers and allow the slide to hold more weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Any of the self-closing mechanisms of the present invention may be mounted on a slide member such as the outer slide member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a cut-out <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to allow the slide member to couple to a rear bracket (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> With any of the aforementioned embodiments, the spring is preferably compressed when armed. In this regard, failure of the spring when armed would likely not cause the spring to eject from the mechanism as would occur if the spring were stretched during when armed as occurs with self-closing mechanisms using springs. Another advantage of the self-closing mechanism of the present invention is that they modular and can be easily incorporated into existing slides by slightly modifying the slide as for example, by forming a slot on the slide inner member web and by shortening the slide intermediate slide if an intermediate member is used. Moreover, the mechanisms of the present invention do not require external tabs or other members to be connected to the slide to interface with the mechanism, which would be subject to early fatigue failures. </paragraph>
