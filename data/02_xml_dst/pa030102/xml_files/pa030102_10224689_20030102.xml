<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a defibrillation device, and more particularly to a personal wearable pacer/cardioverter/defibrillator which monitors a patient&apos;s condition, detects shockable or paceable arrhythmias, determines consciousness, and, in the case that the patient is determined to be unconscious, administers therapy to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, are electrical malfunctions of the heart, in which regular electrical impulses in the heart are replaced by irregular, rapid impulses. These irregular, rapid impulses can cause the heart to stop normal contractions, thereby interrupting blood flow therethrough. Such an interruption in blood flow can cause organ damage or even death. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Normal heart contractions, and thus normal blood flow, can be restored to a patient through application of electric shock. This procedure, which is called defibrillation, has proven highly effective at treating patients with cardiac arrhythmias, provided that it is administered within minutes of the arrhythmia. In the past, this was not always possible, since defibrillation units were large, and thus not easy to move, and could only be operated by an experienced clinician. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In response to the foregoing drawbacks of defibrillation units, implantable defibrillators were developed. Such defibrillators, however, also have several drawbacks. Specifically, use of a such a defibrillator requires surgery, thereby making their use inconvenient and even undesirable under certain circumstances. Moreover, implantable defibrillators are also costly, both in terms of the device itself and in terms of the cost of the surgery and subsequent treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To address the foregoing drawbacks of implantable defibrillators, portable automatic external defibrillators (hereinafter &ldquo;AEDs&rdquo;) were developed. These defibrillators are typically used by trained emergency medical system personnel. The major shortcoming of these defibrillators is the delay between the onset of ventricular fibrillation and the administering of a first shock. It has been estimated that survival decreases by 10% for each minute that passes after the first minute of ventricular fibrillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Temporary high risk patients who do not reach an ICD have little protection against sudden cardiac arrest (&ldquo;SDA&rdquo;), particularly with the discovery that anti-arrhythmia drugs have been proven to be less effective than a placebo. Accordingly, there exists a need for a defibrillator, preferably a portable, wearable defibrillator, which addresses the foregoing drawbacks of conventional defibrillators. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the foregoing needs. For example, according to one aspect, the present invention is a defibrillator for delivering defibrillation energy to a patient. The defibrillator includes at least one electrode which attaches to the patient for transmitting the defibrillation energy to the patient and for receiving patient information from the patient, and a plurality of capacitors which are switchable so as to alter characteristics of the defibrillation energy. According to the invention, a controller controls switching of the plurality of capacitors in accordance with the patient information received from the at least one electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By monitoring the patient for patient information and switching the plurality of capacitors in accordance with the patient information, the foregoing aspect of the invention makes it possible to deliver, to the patient, defibrillation energy which is appropriate for that patient. As a result, the invention provides increased effectiveness in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a way in which to increase long-term wear of a sensing electrode, such as a traditional defibrillation electrode (i.e., electrodes having a conductive surface area of over 60 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), a low-surface-area electrode (i.e., electrodes having a conductive surface area of roughly 60 to 10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), or segmented electrodes (i.e., electrodes having a conductive surface area of roughly 8 to 10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). Specifically, the invention includes a variety of different techniques for increasing the amount of time that an electrode can be worn by a patient without resulting in substantial skin irritation or damage. For example, according to one embodiment, one or more electrodes are moved on the patient&apos;s body periodically. As another example, therapeutic or prophylactic agents are provided in or on the electrode. Also, the size, configuration, and materials used to construct the electrodes contribute the amount of time that the electrodes can be worn by a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a defibrillator for delivering defibrillation energy to a patient. The defibrillator includes a signal generator for generating the defibrillation energy and a plurality of segmented electrodes each having a conductive area for transmitting the defibrillation energy to the patient. The plurality of segmented electrodes are divided into groups of two or more electrodes, each of the groups of electrodes having at least one line connected to the signal generator. Each of the lines has a length that is sufficient for each group of electrodes to be placed on the patient a predetermined distance away from others of the groups of electrodes. In the invention, the electrodes in at least one of the groups are spatially arranged to have an effective conductive area which is greater than a total combined conductive area of the electrodes in the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect, the invention is a segmented electrode device for use during ventricular fibrillation of a patient. The segmented electrode device includes a plurality of segmented electrodes each having a conductive area for transmitting defibrillation energy to the patient. The plurality of segmented electrodes are divided into groups of two or more electrodes, each of the groups of electrodes having at least one line connected to a signal generator. Each of the lines has a length that is sufficient for each group of electrodes to be placed on the patient a predetermined distance away from others of the groups of electrodes. In the invention, the electrodes in at least one of the groups are spatially arranged to have an effective conductive area which is greater than a total combined conductive area of the electrodes in the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the electrode configurations in the foregoing two aspects of the invention, it is possible to simulate a larger conductive area using segmented electrodes. As a result, these aspects of the invention have an advantage over their conventional counterparts. That is, these aspects of the invention are able to provide defibrillation energy to the patient without using large electrodes. Thus, these aspects of the invention provide reduced skin irritation without a corresponding reduction in efficacy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a defibrillator for delivering defibrillation energy to a patient. The defibrillator includes an external interface, over which patient information is transmitted to an external location, and a patient interface, over which the defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient, and over which the patient information is received. A processor is included in the defibrillator, which analyzes the patient information received over the patient interface and which controls transmission of the defibrillation energy to the patient based on at least a first portion of the patient information. A memory stores at least a second portion of the patient information prior to transmission of the second portion of the patient information over the external interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> By controlling transmission of the defibrillation energy to the patient based on at least a first portion of information received from the patient, the invention is able to tailor the defibrillation energy to the patient&apos;s needs. Moreover, because the invention includes a memory which stores at least a second portion of the patient information, and includes an external interface over which such information may be transmitted, the invention is capable of recording patient information, such as patient electrocardiogram (hereinafter &ldquo;ECG&rdquo;) information or the like for a period of time, and of transmitting that patient information to an external location, such as a central repository, hospital, doctor, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention a defibrillator for delivering defibrillation energy to a patient. The defibrillator includes a processor and a patient interface, over which patient information is received from the patient and over which the defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient. The processor operates in a normal mode and a low-power consumption mode, wherein, during the normal mode, the processor receives the patient information and controls transmission of the defibrillation energy in accordance with the patient information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> By having the processor operate in a low-power consumption mode, the invention reduces the amount of power consumed by the defibrillator. As a result, a power supply will last longer in the defibrillator of the present invention than in its conventional counterparts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a defibrillation system which includes a defibrillator for delivering defibrillation energy to a patient and a base station connected to the defibrillator. The defibrillator includes a plurality of electrodes connected to the patient for transmitting defibrillation energy to the patient and for receiving patient information from the patient, and a memory which stores the patient information and defibrillation information, the defibrillation information relating to operation of the defibrillator. The defibrillator also includes a base station interface, over which the patient information and the defibrillation information are transmitted, and over which external information is received, and a controller for controlling when the defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient based on the patient information and at least part of the external information. The base station includes a defibrillator interface which mates to the base station interface of the defibrillator and over which (i) the defibrillation information and the patient information is received from the memory of the defibrillator, and (ii) the external information is transmitted to the defibrillator. The base station also includes an external interface, over which the defibrillation information and the patient information is transmitted to an external location. and over which the external information is received from the external location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the foregoing arrangement, it is possible to transmit patient and defibrillation information from a defibrillator to a base station and from the base station to an external location, such as a central repository, doctor, hospital, etc. Moreover, the foregoing arrangement makes it possible to transmit external information from the base station to the defibrillator. This external information can be used, e.g., to reprogram the defibrillator, to alert a patient to a possible condition in the patient or the defibrillator, etc. In particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, a memory on the defibrillator containing patient and defibrillation information is removable, and can be transferred to the base station or to an external location for downloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a defibrillation system which includes a defibrillator for delivering predetermined defibrillation energy to a patient, an indicator which indicates operational defects in the defibrillator, and a base station which is interfaced to the defibrillator. The base station performs diagnostics on the defibrillator in order to detect operational defects in the defibrillator, and transmits results of the diagnostics to the defibrillator. The indicator provides an indication of such operational defects in the defibrillator when the base station detects operational defects in the defibrillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By alerting the patient to operational defects in the defibrillator while the defibrillator is still in the base station, this aspect of the invention is able to reduce the chances of malfunction following a cardiac arrhythmia. As a result, this aspect of the invention increases the patient&apos;s chances of surviving an arrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a method of treating a patient for ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or other treatable rhythm using a pacer/converter/defibrillator in accordance with the present invention (hereinafter referred to solely as a &ldquo;defibrillator&rdquo;). The method includes monitoring the patient for a predetermined condition via one or more electrodes on the defibrillator, sending a message to the patient in response to the predetermined condition, activating the defibrillator so that the defibrillator delivers defibrillation energy to the patient, and storing at least one of the results of the monitoring, sending and activating steps in a memory on the defibrillator. The method also includes downloading information stored in the memory of the defibrillator to a base station having an external interface, and transmitting the information downloaded from the memory of the base station to an external location via the external interface of the base station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> By sending a message to the patient in response to the predetermined condition, by processing the patient&apos;s response, and by other consciousness detection methods, the present invention is able to reduce the chances of defibrillation energy being delivered to the patient while the patient is still conscious. Moreover, the foregoing aspect of the invention is able to store at least some information relating to the arrhythmia and the patient&apos;s response thereto, and to download that information to a base station, from whence the information may be transmitted to an external location for analysis or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this regard, according to another aspect, the present invention is a base station for use with a defibrillator. The base station includes a defibrillator interface over which information is exchanged with the defibrillator, an external interface over which information is exchanged with an external entity, and a controller. The controller (i) receives patient information and defibrillation information from the defibrillator, (ii) transmits the patient information and defibrillation information to the external entity, (iii) receives defibrillator programming information from the external entity, (iv) programs the defibrillator in accordance with the defibrillator programming information, (v) performs diagnostics on the defibrillator, and (vi) transmits results of the diagnostics to at least one of the defibrillator and the external entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, the base station of the present invention may both act as an interface between a defibrillator and an external entity and provide a patient with a means to ensure proper operation of the defibrillator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect, the present invention is a method for reprogramming a defibrillator based on a central database of information relating to patients that use a type of defibrillator. The method includes collecting, in the central database, information relating to a plurality of patients that use the type of defibrillator, analyzing the information stored in the central database so as to test an algorithm for detecting irregular heart activity, and correcting the algorithm for detecting irregular heart activity based on a result of the analyzing process. The method also includes transmitting a corrected algorithm to a plurality of base stations corresponding to the plurality of patients, and reprogramming a defibrillator in each of the base stations using the corrected algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By providing a way in which to test algorithms for detecting irregular heart activity, a way in which to correct such algorithms, and a way in which to reprogram a defibrillator with a corrected algorithm, the present invention is able to improve its performance over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the invention features a long-term cardiac monitoring and defibrillation system that is wearable by a patient. The system includes at least two electrode arrays electrically connected to a portable defibrillator. The electrode arrays are spatially separated and adhered to portions of the patient&apos;s skin in the thoracic window area for an extended period of time, such that electrical activity of the heart can be monitored and effective defibrillation and/or pacing impulses can be delivered to the patient&apos;s heart. The electrode arrays comprise plural electrodes which are capable of sensing the patient&apos;s heart condition by detecting the electrical activity of the heart, and of delivering defibrillation or pacing impulses to the patient&apos;s heart when required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the cardiac monitoring and defibrillation system of the invention comprises features which enhances the long-term wearability of the system. These features include use of a low-current defibrillation waveform and electrodes having a composition and/or geometric design adapted to minimize the area of the electrodes. In this regard, it has been determined that use of a lower current than that typically used for defibrillation can provided effective defibrillation, particularly when coupled with electrode arrays having electrode surface areas which are significantly smaller than the surface area of conventional defibrillation electrodes. The use of reduced area electrodes minimizes irritation to the skin. These features also permit higher impedance materials to be used in the electrodes, which is also less irritating to the patient&apos;s skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the electrode array comprises multiple spatially separated electrodes separated by non-conductive material, passive material or free space. The use of multiple smaller electrodes minimizes the electrode area in contact with the skin needed to deliver an effective defibrillation impulse to the heart, thereby reducing the area of skin in contact with electrode materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention features a long term cardiac monitoring and defibrillation system and method that ameliorates, reduces or prevents irritation of the patient&apos;s skin caused by delivery of defibrillation impulses and/or by the constant contact of the electrodes with the skin. According to this aspect, skin that becomes irritated from contact with the electrodes is permitted to recover by periodically detaching the electrode arrays and moving or rotating them by a predetermined amount, and re-affixing either the same or new electrode arrays to different portions of the skin within the patient&apos;s thoracic window area. This moving or rotating allows substantially different sections of the patient&apos;s skin to be in contact with the electrodes so that portions of the skin previously in contact with the electrodes are allowed to recover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The electrode arrays of the present invention preferably are designed for long term patient wearability. To this end, the electrode arrays include a therapeutic or prophylactic material which ameliorates, reduces or prevents irritation to the patient&apos;s skin in contact with the electrode arrays. Therapeutic or prophylactic materials may include, for example, wound healing agents, moisturizers, emollients, protective agents or antibacterial agents. Each electrode array comprises electrically conductive areas (electrodes) and electrically non-conductive areas (passive areas). The electrodes are capable of sensing the electrical activity of the heart, delivering electrical impulses (cardio and defibrillation) to the heart, as well as tactile stimulation and pacing signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The electrode arrays preferably include an adhesive portion for adhering the array directly to the skin. However, external means for retaining the electrode arrays in electrical proximity to the skin may be used, such as a vest or a band. Long term wearability of the electrode arrays may be enhanced by selecting materials for use in the electrode array which minimize irritation to the skin in contact with the array. Such materials may include, for example, adhesives and backing materials having a high moisture vapor transmission rate and conductive materials for use in the electrodes having low salt (ionic) concentrations or comprised of silicone or other adhesive materials that are conductive by means of additives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, long term wear can be enhanced and skin irritation reduced by including in the system means for monitoring, and adjusting as necessary, the environment at the interface between the electrode array and the skin. Such means may include, for example, means for monitoring and adjusting the &lcub;PH at the skin-electrode interface in order to maintain a neutral non-irritating interface; and means for controlling the ion flow at the interface between the electrodes and the skin. In the latter embodiment, ion flow would be reduced to a minimum except for the short time during which a defibrillating shock is being delivered, at which time the ion flow would temporarily increase to provide a conductive path for the defibrillation impulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This brief summary has been provided so that the nature of the invention may be understood quickly. A more complete understanding of the invention can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof in connection with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a defibrillation system for use in treating patients who have suffered from cardiac arrhythmias. A representative embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. As shown in these figures, defibrillation system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is comprised of base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and wearable defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A brief overview of the operation of each of these components is provided below, followed by detailed descriptions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of interfacing either to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or to electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. To this end, both electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> include physical connector identifiers at their respective interfaces to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By reading these connector identifiers, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to determine both the type of interfaced device (i.e., a base station or electrode harness) and the identity of a particular interfaced device (i.e., one electrode harness as opposed to another), and then to react accordingly </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes one or more sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which interface to patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and which are used both to monitor the patient and to transmit defibrillation energy to the patient. In this regard, although defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be utilized with non-segmented electrodes having a low surface area or with traditional defibrillation electrodes, sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprise segmented electrodes since these require the most description. Defibrillation energy, which can comprise an electric signal having a bi-phasic waveform, a mono-phasic waveform, or a truncated exponential waveform, is generated by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the event that predetermined conditions have been detected in the patient. These predetermined conditions include whether the patient has suffered a cardiac arrhythmia, whether the patient is conscious, as well as other conditions, such as patient impedance, that are monitored by sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also capable of providing pacing impulses and tactile stimulation signals to the patient via electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The tactile stimulation signals alert the patient to abnormal cardiac activity in the patient, whereas the pacing impulses stimulate contractions of the patient&apos;s heart. While electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is being worn by the patient, data may be transmitted directly from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to personal computer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> via non-contact interface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interfaced to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is able to perform diagnostics on the defibrillator, to reprogram the defibrillator, and to retrieve data stored in the defibrillator. Such data can include an operational history of the defibrillator, information concerning the patient&apos;s cardiac activity, and the like. All or some of this retrieved data may be transmitted, via personal computer interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for display and/or processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Data retrieved by base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be transmitted to central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> via external data link <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> preferably stores this data, together with patient and defibrillation information corresponding to a plurality of other patients, all of whom use the same type of defibrillator. A personal computer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is in communication with central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This personal computer may be used to analyze the patient and defibrillation information received from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in view of corresponding information from the plurality of other patients, and, if desired, to provide the results of this analysis back to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a link to patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> comprises test equipment which simulates bodily functions and characteristics of a patient, including cardiac activity and thoracic impedance. During testing, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in much the same way that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors a patient and, in a case that predetermined conditions have been detected in patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, transmits defibrillation energy to patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. To aid in the testing process, patient simulator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> also simulates patient responses to the defibrillation energy provided by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and provides response information back to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This response information may be transmitted to, and analyzed by, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then provided to any one or more of central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Electrode Harness </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a close-up view of electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is preferably disposable and, in preferred embodiments of the invention, can be worn for approximately 2 to 7 days or longer for a cumulative period of 1 week to 12 months. To this end, electrode harness may include a means for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to determine how long electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has been connected thereto. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes an identification resistor (not shown) as its physical connector identifier. Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> measures the resistance across this resistor and then starts a countdown, after which defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> notifies the patient that it is time to change the electrode harness. In this regard, each electrode harness may include a different, unique resistance associated therewith. Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may measure this resistance by passing a current therethrough and, in this manner, determine the identity of an interfaced electrode harness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, non-electrically conductive padding <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, electrical leads (or &ldquo;lines&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprise the defibrillator&apos;s interface to the patient. Specifically, sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> attach to the patient so as to monitor the patient, transmit tactile stimulation energy, and to transmit defibrillation energy to the patient under appropriate circumstances. Each electrode may comprise a single layer of conductive material. In preferred embodiments of the invention, however, each electrode is multi-layered as shown, for example, in the cross-sectional view of electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes three layers, namely top cover assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, conductor/wire assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and skin interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Skin interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contacts directly with the patient&apos;s skin and comprises a layer of material, such as a hydrogel, that is capable of transmitting defibrillation energy to the patient without causing substantial irritation or harm to the skin. For larger patients, or hypoallergenic patients, conductive screens or meshes can be used in addition to or in place of hydrogel. These screens or meshes may be used in combination with a cream, such as a hydrating cream or a skin healing cream. Such creams also may be applied to the patient&apos;s skin before attaching the electrodes thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Skin interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contacts to conductor/wire assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which can be either substantially coextensive with, or smaller than, skin interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Conductor/wire assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes conductive layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>wire connection <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>wire <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and sealing layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Conductive layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>preferably comprises a silver/silver chloride polymer base ink silk-screened onto a layer of Tyvek (used as an insulator and as a carrier) which is die-cut and folded. A wire with a welded washer is then attached to conductive layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by means of a washer (tin plated nickel) and eyelet (a hollow rivet that is crimped in order to hold the assembly together). Insulating tape is then wrapped around this connection in order to reduce corrosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the silver/silver chloride formulation, conductor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may comprise conductive metal such as tin, silver, gold, copper, salts or oxides of these conductive metals, carbon, a substrate which has been coated with a conductive compound (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene), an ink silkscreened on a carrier, metallized cloth, solid metal or carbon grid, foil, plate, etc. Conductor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably has a thickness which is sufficient to transmit at least ten successive defibrillation energy signals having peak amplitudes of 23 amperes for a duration of 10.75 msec each. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Top cover assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes foam insulating layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and wearable adhesive layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which can comprise an adhesive material fixed to a backing, such as tape or the like, is disposed adjacent to conductor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and/or skin interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is used to attach electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the patient&apos;s skin. In preferred embodiments of the invention, adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may also be temperature sensitive, meaning that adhesion thereof increases or decreases in response to temperature variations. Adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is preferably non-conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> should also be adapted for long-term wear. To this end, an adhesive having a high moisture vapor transmission rate (&ldquo;MVTR&rdquo;) of approximately 300 to 1500 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/day is suitable for use with the invention. By virtue of this feature of the invention, the adhesive is made breathable, meaning that it permits air to be transmitted therethrough to the patient&apos;s skin. This increases the amount of time an electrode may be worn without causing substantial harm to the patient&apos;s skin. Adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> should also be sufficient to adhere to the patient&apos;s body in the face of normal movements or muscle contractions and in the face of normal water exposure such as might occur during bathing or sweating. However, adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> should not be so strong as to cause substantial discomfort during removal of an electrode. To this end, adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> preferably has a peel strength of 500 g/cm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are applicator <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and release liner assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Applicator <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> includes two layers&mdash;a bottom layer having cut-outs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a top layer having an adhesive <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Cut-outs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>limit the amount of adhesive that contacts the top side of the electrode. Release liner assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes cut-out <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on upper layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(closest to the hydrogel) which causes only a portion of urethane bottom layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to come into contact with upper layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>This configuration of release liner assembly <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, particularly cut-out <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>allows bottom layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to be removed first from an electrode, followed by upper-layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>without causing any separation of the electrode from the applicator assembly. Moreover, cut-outs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on applicator <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>facilitate removal of applicator <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from top cover assembly <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> without causing harm to the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> An alternative electrode configuration to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> show additional alternative electrode configurations. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a finger-patterned electrode <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprising a conductive adhesive polymer layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a carbon sheet <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and a medical adhesive carrier <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, covering and extending beyond the edges of the polymer layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the carbon sheet <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, a metal sheet or a metal fabric may replace carbon sheet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</cross-reference> show a rectangular electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprising metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, pressure pad backing <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and medical adhesive carrier <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, covering and extending beyond the edges of the metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the pressure pad backing <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The front surface of metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> comes in contact with patient&apos;s skin <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> and pressure pad backing <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> contacts the back surface of metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and keeps metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in close contact with skin <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. In this regard, a pressure pad is a unit which can be deformed by pressure applied in the direction perpendicular to the skin. By maintaining a thickness that is less than a free dimension, pressure in the pad is assured. Medical adhesive carrier <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> contacts pressure pad backing <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, a metal fabric replaces metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In another embodiment, a metal fabric replaces metal foil sheet <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the electrode in which the adhesive surface is covered with a pull-tab covering to allow the patient to place the electrode on the skin and then pull the tab to expose the adhesive surface and maintain the electrode in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A conductive portion of each sensing electrode, which in this case are segmented electrodes, preferably has a surface area that is roughly 8 to 10 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>; although other dimensions may be used. The present invention, however, takes advantage of &ldquo;spreading resistance&rdquo; in the patient&apos;s bodily tissue so as to permit this reduction in the surface area of the conductive portion each electrode. Spreading resistance is a property of human tissue which causes defibrillation energy (or any other electric signal for that matter) applied to the patient&apos;s skin to spread outward over the skin and downward and outward through the patient&apos;s tissue. In the context of the present invention, once current from the defibrillation energy is applied from an electrode to the patient&apos;s skin, the current diffuses beyond the electrode and continues to diffuse as the current moves into the underlying tissue. As a result of this diffusion, the density of the current decreases with increasing distance from the perimeter of the electrode. The present invention compensates for this by placing sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in a geometric pattern such that the interaction between diffusing current from each sensing electrode results in an accumulation of spreading current in areas between sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The result is that an effective area is created in which current densities in the path between groups of sensing electrodes (e.g., sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) are similar to that of a large electrode having a perimeter equal to an outer perimeter of all of the sensing electrodes in the group. A similar effect may be achieved through random placement of the electrodes on the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Thus, by spatially arranging the sensing electrodes to take advantage of human tissue&apos;s spreading resistance, the present invention is able to create a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; conductive surface using relatively small electrodes. The virtual conductive surface can be significantly larger than a combined conducive area of the individual sensing electrodes. This also contributes to a lower impedance for a combined surface area of the sensing electrodes than would be the case for a continuous electrode having a similar surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Each of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be shaped so that the conductive portion thereof has a perimeter which is greater than a circumference corresponding to a radius of the electrode. That is, since charge tends to migrate to the perimeter of an electrode, the present invention attempts to maximize the perimeter of each electrode, particularly conductive surfaces thereof, thereby increasing the amplitude of the defibrillation energy that the electrode can handle without causing substantial burns to the patient. Examples of electrodes with such a perimeter include star-shaped electrodes, square electrodes, swirled-shaped electrodes, etc. It is, however, noted that conventional circular electrodes may be used in conjunction with the present invention as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To increase operational efficiency of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> should be placed within a &ldquo;thoracic window&rdquo; on the patient&apos;s body. A thoracic window is defined as an area of the patient&apos;s body which is suitable for placing electrodes so as to optimize delivery of defibrillation energy to the patient&apos;s heart, and is described in an article by Geddes et al. the American Heart Journal, volume 94, page 67 (1977), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application as if set forth herein in full. In this regard, there are two currently defined thoracic windows on a patient. These comprise the anterior-posterior thoracic window and the apex-sternum thoracic window. In the apex-sternum thoracic window, electrodes are typically placed underneath the patient&apos;s left rib cage and over the patients right shoulder area. In the anterior-posterior thoracic window, electrodes are typically placed on a patient&apos;s lower left back and left front. Preferably, the sensing electrodes are placeable over the thoracic window either randomly or in a geometric pattern which is sufficient to cover a large enough area of the patient&apos;s myocardium to cause adequate defibrillation upon application of defibrillation energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be attached or placed in contact with the skin by various methods. Proper defibrillation requires that the electrodes be in close contact with the patient&apos;s skin, in addition to being placed in an appropriate location within the patient&apos;s thoracic window area. Preferably, the electrode are attached to the patient&apos;s skin using an adhesive thereon, as described in more detail below. However, other attachment means are possible. For example, a thoracic wrap made out of cotton or spandex can be used to assure proper placement of the electrodes and good contact between the electrodes an the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure proper current accumulation in areas between the sensing electrodes, each sensing electrode in a group (e.g., the group of electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) should be placed within a predetermined distance of other sensing electrodes in the group. In preferred embodiments of the invention, each sensing electrode in each group of electrodes is separated from other sensing electrodes in that same group by between 0.5 and 3 times an effective diameter of each electrode, where the effective diameter corresponds to the farthest distance between two points on the electrode. To ensure proper separation among the sensing electrodes, electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes non-electrically conductive pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (i.e., the passive areas), on which groups of sensing electrodes can be mounted in predetermined geometric configurations. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(i.e., the active areas) are mounted on pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a triangular configuration, while sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are mounted on pad <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a rectangular configuration. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows only two geometric arrangements for sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the invention is not limited to these. Rather, any geometric arrangement may be utilized, including, but not limited to, a checkerboard pattern, swirl patterns, interlocking patterns, star patterns, crescent patterns, E-shaped patterns, F-shaped patterns, L-shaped patterns, X-shaped patterns, H-shaped patterns, O-shaped patterns, C-shaped patterns, etc. Of course, the electrodes may be arranged in a random manner as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Preferably, pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are flexible so as to facilitate placement of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on contours of the patient&apos;s body. It is noted, however, that pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> need not be flexible. Rather, an adhesive tape can be used in place of pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, in addition to pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As still another alternative, pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be used selectively in electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, meaning that pads can be used to mount some of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and not others. In fact, this is the case in the representative embodiment of the invention depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. That is, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, segmented electrodes is not mounted on a pad, but rather &ldquo;floats&rdquo;, meaning that it can be mounted anywhere on a patient&apos;s body, constrained, of course, by the length of its electrical lead <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As described below, electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>does not provide the defibrillation energy to the patient, but rather is used only to monitor the patient&apos;s ECG. However, to provide greater flexibility in electrode placement, in alternative embodiments of the invention, all electrodes may float in the same manner as sensing electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h. </italic></highlight>In the case that all or some electrodes float, the invention may include an applicator tray, such as tray <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, having cups <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which arrange the electrodes in geometric pattens so as to ensure accurate placement within the patient&apos;s thoracic window. That is, the applicator tray ensures that the electrodes will be spatially arranged in the manner described above so as to take advantage of human tissue&apos;s spreading effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As noted above, electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may include a hydrogel or other conductive material on a surface thereof which comes into contact with the patient&apos;s skin, i.e., on the skin interface of the electrode. The hydrogel is electrically conductive, thereby permitting transmission of the defibrillation energy to the patient, but has a relatively low ion concentration that is low enough so as to not to cause substantial skin irritation. In preferred embodiments, the conductivity of the hydrogel is variable based, e.g., on temperature, etc. In addition, the hydrogel preferably has a relatively high MVTR, thereby making the hydrogel breathable. As was the case above with respect to adhesive <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, this reduces skin irritation caused by wearing the electrodes, and thus increases the amount of time that the electrodes can be worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Hydrogels or other conductive materials used with conventional ECG electrodes may be used in the present invention, since the deleterious effects of such materials will be countered by the present invention for reasons described both above and below. In addition, conductive materials which meet the above qualifications include electrolytes, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), or lithium chloride (LiCl). Currently preferred hydrogel materials include hydrophilic polymers, such as karaya gum, gum acacia, locust bean gum, polysaccharide gum, modified polysaccharide, or polyacrylamide. A hydrating agent, such as water or polyhydric alcohol (e.g., glycerine, propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol, etc.) may also be included in the conductive material. In these cases, water is typically present at a concentration from about 1% to 60% by weight, whereas polyhydric alcohol is typically present at a concentration from about 10% to 50% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the electrode interface to the skin may include, instead of or in addition to a hydrogel, a mesh, screen, or other porous material. These elements are conductive and, due to their porous nature, allow air to pass therethrough to the patient&apos;s skin. As was the case with the hydrogel described above, this feature of the invention provides for prolonged wearability of the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The hydrogel on each sensing electrode may also include a therapeutic or prophylactic agent which reduces skin irritation caused by the electrode, and/or which promotes healing of wounds or skin irritation that may be caused by the sensing electrodes. Such an agent may be applied directly to each electrode, or capsules which release the agent in response to the defibrillation energy may be applied to the electrode. A therapeutic or prophylactic agent may also be included on each of pads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order to promote skin health. Agents which render the patient&apos;s skin porous, such as keratolytic agents (e.g., salicylic acid) or rubefacient (e.g., methyl salicylate) may be included on each electrode or pad so as to facilitate transmission of the therapeutic or prophylactic agent into the skin and/or to permit use of low water content hydrogels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Examples of therapeutic or prophylactic agents that may be used with the present invention include moisturizers, emollients, bactericides, mold inhibitors, stabilizers or buffers to maintain a neutral PH and to reduce corrosion and skin sensitivity, gelation inhibitors (e.g., Mg(OAc)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), healing agents, hormonal agents (e.g., hydrocortisone (steroids)), protective agents, etc. Examples of acceptable bactericides and mold inhibitors include antibactierals, antiseptics, antifungals, boric acid, bacitracin, acriflavine, formaldehyde, gentian violet, mercuric sulfide, mercurochrome, neomycin, and iodine. Examples of acceptable stabilizers include oligo or polybasic organic acids and their salts (including chelating agents), polyethers, tartaric acid, citric acid, and n-alkyl sulfonate, where n is from 8 to 16 carbon atoms. Examples of acceptable healing agents include allantoin, peruvian balsam, vitamin A, and vitamin B. Examples of acceptable protective agents include benzoin, charcoal, talc, zinc oxide, and aloe vera. These therapeutic agents may be used both prior to use or after use to promote healing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The amount of therapeutic or prophylactic material used corresponds to an amount effective to reduce irritation, or to promote recovery of irritated skin. The therapeutic or prophylactic agent may be in any form useful to achieve the intended purpose, including liquid solutions, creams, gels, solids, granules, powders or any other form, including microcapsules. As noted above, the therapeutic or prophylactic agent may be included as part of the electrode, e.g., incorporated in the conductive areas of the electrode, or incorporated in a passive area of the electrode array. Alternatively, the electrode array may comprise three areas: electrode areas, passive areas and areas containing the therapeutic or prophylactic material. In addition, the therapeutic or prophylactic material may be applied to the skin prior to attaching the electrodes (pre-treatment), or after the electrodes have been removed (post-treatment). In another embodiment, skin irritation may be reduced by including in the electrode array means for monitoring, controlling and/or correcting the skin environment in contact with the electrode array. For example, it is possible to monitor the electrode-to-skin PH, and adjust the PH accordingly. Along these lines, the electrodes may comprise a multi-layered matrix for controlling ion flow between the skin and the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments of the invention, rather than using the sensing electrode configuration described above, i.e., segmented electrodes, non-segmented electrodes having conductive portions of less than 60 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and, in some cases, even to less than 30 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>may be utilized. In this regard, traditionally, it was necessary for conductive portions of defibrillation electrodes to have a surface area of 60 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 80 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in order to deliver a sufficient defibrillation energy to the patient. The present invention, however, takes advantage of the &ldquo;spreading resistance&rdquo; effect described above so as to permit reduction in the surface area of each electrode. Of course, the features described herein with respect to sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may also be used in conjunction with the non-segmented electrodes described herein. These features include, but are not limited to, using hydrogels having low ion concentrations, therapeutic and prophylactic agents, and/or high MVTRs, effecting electrode movement relative to the patient so as to reduce the deleterious effects of electrode-to-skin contact, etc., utilizing an adhesive designed for long-term wear, etc. As well, the following monitoring and energy-transmitting functions described with respect to segmented electrodes may also be used in conjunction with the non-segmented electrodes described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments of the invention, traditional non-segmented defibrillation electrodes, i.e., electrodes having a surface area of 60 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 80 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, may be used in conjunction with all aspects of the invention described herein, particularly those aspects of the invention that provide for long term (i.e., greater than two days) wearability of the electrodes. In this regard, these aspects include, but are not limited to, using the electrodes in conjunction with hydrogels having low ion concentrations, therapeutic and prophylactic agents, and/or high MVTRs, effecting electrode movement relative to the patient so as to reduce the deleterious effects of electrode-to-skin contact, etc., utilizing an adhesive designed for long-term wear, etc. As well, the following monitoring and energy-transmitting functions described with respect to sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may also be used in conjunction with the traditional non-segmented electrodes described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It is noted that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be used with any type of commercially-available subcutaneous electrode as well. It is still further noted that the invention may include combinations of two or more of the foregoing types of electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, each group of electrodes and/or single electrode has at least one electrical lead mechanically connected between its lead interface and power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The leads can be standard cables comprising electrically conductive wires sheathed in a flexible, protective material, e.g., a flexible plastic material. The wires used in the leads preferably are able to carry repeated defibrillation impulses of at least 20 A for a 20 millisecond duration, and preferably have adequate insulation qualities satisfying a high potential test for about 1750 V. In addition, the cables preferably are flexible, durable, soft and comfortable while having sturdy insulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> An exploded view of power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes base <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, top <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and, sandwiched therebetween, batteries <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also comprised of connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which includes the physical connector identifier for electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and which interfaces power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and electrical leads <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To this end, connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes socket <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> which receives the electrical leads via holes <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. Socket <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> fits within top <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> such that pin <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> on top <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> contacts with hole <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> on socket <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Socket <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is shielded so as to protect signals being transmitted therethrough from batteries <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. This shielding is tied to the &ldquo;floating&rdquo; ground in the battery and also to shields from the leads to the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, each electrical lead is non-removably connected to connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, meaning that each lead is hard-wired to connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or is otherwise connected to connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a way in which removal of the electrical leads from connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will damage either one or both of these components. It is noted, however, that alternative embodiments of the invention are possible, in which each lead is removably connected to connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises the primary power cell for wearable defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To this end, batteries <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> comprise non-rechargeable lithium batteries (e.g., DL123A, size 2/3 A) which are capable of providing 2 to 7 days of normal operation of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including delivering at least six defibrillation energy (i.e., shocks) having peak currents of 23 A to the patient. In this regard, the working voltage of power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably 3.3 to 6.6 V, with the maximum output being 6.6 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made water-resistant by sealing power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within a silicone membrane (not shown) or the like. In this regard, power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be made water-resistant by a number of other means as well. For example, it is possible to use a variety of other insulating materials in place of silicone. By sealing power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this manner, it is possible to reduce the risk of unintended electric shock during activities, such as showering or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Each electrical lead on electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a length that is sufficient for each corresponding electrode or group of electrodes to be placed on the patient at a predetermined distance away from others of the electrodes or groups of electrodes. As noted above, by spatially arranging defibrillator (as opposed to solely ECG) electrodes in this manner, the invention ensures proper accumulation of current in areas between the sensing electrodes. The present invention provides an additional advantage in this regard in that groups of electrodes arranged in geometric patterns on the patient are movable relative to the patient in a manner which ensures that the geometric patterns are substantially retained, but are at different orientations relative to the patient. For example, it is possible to rotate pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on a patient such that pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is still within the patient&apos;s thoracic window (e.g., either the apex-sternum thoracic window, the anterior-posterior thoracic window, or some combination thereof), but such that sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>do not contact the patient&apos;s skin at the same location. Random rotation or movement may also be used to accomplish the same result. For example, in a case that electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> all float, random motion may be the best way in which to achieve the desired result. Moreover, in accordance with the invention, and particularly with non-segmented electrodes, it is possible merely to shift each electrode from a first position to a second position, such that portions of the first and second positions overlap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> By providing for the foregoing rotation and/or movement, together with the therapeutic and prophylactic agents described above, the present invention reduces skin damage which may occur due to prolonged use of wearable defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. To achieve optimum reduction in skin damage, each sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, group of sensing electrodes, or individual non-sensing electrodes should be rotated in the above manner roughly once every 12 hours to 7 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In operation, sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are capable of transmitting electrical signals from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a patient. These electrical signals include, but are not necessarily limited to, defibrillation energy, tactile stimulation signals, pacing signals, and AC and DC signals used to measure a patient&apos;s skin and thoracic impedance. The same information used to measure the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance may also be used to determine the patient&apos;s respiration and pulse rates. The defibrillation energy preferably has a bi-phasic waveform with two phases. These phases may have substantially equal durations or, alternatively, may have different durations, e.g., the first phase may be roughly 6 msec and the second phase may be roughly 4 msec. An example of a bi-phasic waveform having substantially equal durations is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> (described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the waveform of the defibrillation energy may also be mono-phasic, i.e., the waveform may comprise just the first one of the two phases shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, or may comprise a truncated exponential waveform. Monophasic waveforms typically require greater current, generally on the order of 15% to 20% greater, in order to achieve substantially the same effect as bi-phasic waveforms. Regarding the pacing impulses, these preferably comprise waveforms having a low peak current of roughly 150 mA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are also capable of transmitting patient information from the patient to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This patient information includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the patient&apos;s skin and thoracic impedance, artifact noise in the patient&apos;s body (caused, e.g., by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, agonal breathing, seizures, patient handling, and ambulatory or vehicular motion), sensory stimulation signals from the patient, and the patient&apos;s ECG, including any cardiovascular signals evidencing abnormal heart activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In this regard, electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> preferably includes two independent differential channels, namely &ldquo;ECG 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;ECG 2&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for measuring the patient&apos;s ECG. In this regard, groups of electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>comprising ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> both provide the defibrillation energy to the patient and monitor the patient&apos;s ECG, whereas electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>comprising ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is used solely for monitoring the patient&apos;s ECG. ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serves as the primary monitoring channel for ECG analysis, whereas ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> serves as a backup for use in a case that ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not operating or is not operating properly (e.g., if ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is relatively noisy). Alternatively, ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be used as a means of verifying the validity of an ECG obtained via ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, by comparing ECGs obtained from ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> an ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is possible to confirm the validity of the patient&apos;s ECG. It is also possible to confirm whether the electrodes are properly attached to the patient based on this comparison. As still another alternative, it is possible to &ldquo;average&rdquo; ECGs from ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in order to obtain an averaged ECG for the patient, or to increase ECG resolution by using inputs from both ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The use to which defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> puts the ECG signal, as well as the other signals obtained via an electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is provided in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> For example, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides several ways to measure the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance based on information received from sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the patient&apos;s impedance is determined directly by applying an AC or DC signal through an electrode, sampling data obtained from the electrode in response to the AC or DC signal, and analyzing the sampled data. More specifically, in preferred embodiments of the invention, this method of measuring the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance entails sampling such data from an electrode within <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> seconds of defibrillator power-on and then every 10 seconds for a 160 msec period at a sample rate of 4 msec or to continuously sample the impedance signal. Filtering is then performed on the sampled data so as to reduce the bandwidth of the sampled data to less than 10 Hz. The sampled data is then analyzed so as to provide a noise magnitude estimate for the signal and a frequency content of the signal. Subsequent processing is then performed to obtain a measurement of the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance by averaging all of the data samples in each 160 msec period. This averaging and filtering is performed in order to reduce the effects of artifact noise associated with CPR, muscle tremors, and agonal breathing. Of course, this processing occurs in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and not in electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing method, the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance is also calculated by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> each time the defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient. Specifically, the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance may be determined before, during and after transmission of defibrillation energy, based on patient information received from the electrodes in response to the defibrillation energy. </paragraph>

A description of these features of the invention is provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably small enough to make the defibrillator portable, and thus wearable, yet large enough to house the circuitry included within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can comprise a belt, or the like, which a patient can wear around his or her waist, chest, etc. However, in preferred embodiments of the invention, housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a rectangular casing that is roughly 6 inches in length, by 4 inches in width, by 2 inches in depth, or preferably 5.2 inches by 3.2 inches by 1.5 inches. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is comprised of base <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and top <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The preferred weight of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is approximately 1.5 pounds or preferably 1.0 pound or lighter. In this regard, the invention is able to achieve its small size by using high-energy capacitors (e.g., 500 &mgr;F, 400 &mgr;F, etc.) to store and deliver defibrillation energy, as described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and communications link <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> comprise external interfaces on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed on housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to permit connection of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to mating connector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and to permit connection of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to corresponding mating connector <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> on base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). To this end, connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably includes two high-speed data pins (not shown), which permits base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to interface to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a same point that electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> interfaces to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By virtue of this arrangement, information can be transmitted between defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and either base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or a patient. Communications link <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> comprises a non-contact interface to personal computer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), over which information may be transmitted between defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and personal computer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) while defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is being worn by the patient or, if desired, at other times as well. Examples of such a non-contact interface include an infrared (hereinafter &ldquo;IR&rdquo;) link or a radio frequency (hereinafter &ldquo;RF&rdquo;) link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises a liquid crystal display (hereinafter &ldquo;LCD&rdquo;) or the like (in preferred embodiments, a Standish 162SLC 2&times;16 dot matrix display), having two lines for displaying information, including text and errors, to a patient or to a clinician operating defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This information can include, but is not limited to, information concerning the patient&apos;s heart activity, such as the patient&apos;s ECG or the like; messages upon detection of abnormal activity in the patient&apos;s heart; statements indicating that the patient has been wearing electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for greater than a recommended period of time; instructions for the use of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; prompts for using defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; errors that have occurred in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; messages transmitted to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from an external location via base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or personal computer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>; an indication that one or more of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> have become detached from the patient; and an indication that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> cannot differentiate between artifact noise in a patient&apos;s body and a cardiac arrhythmia. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the information is displayed for about 15 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In addition to the LCD, one or more visual indicators, such as light emitting diode (hereinafter &ldquo;LED&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, may be provided on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to indicate different operational states thereof. For example, in preferred embodiments of the invention, LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> blinks when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating normally, is off when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is without power (including when power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has failed), and is continuously illuminated during power-up error detection diagnostics performed by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprises a speaker (in preferred embodiments, an MG Electronics MCS298 speaker) or the like, which provides verbal messages corresponding to information displayed on visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. These messages may be output in a variety of different languages on both visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In preferred embodiments of the invention, auditory indicator <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> echos visual display <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and has a volume that is adjustable at least up to 60 or 70 decibels. Auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may also be configured to provide additional sounds, such as tones, buzzing, beeping, etc. to indicate error conditions within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Examples of such error conditions include, but are not limited to, a low or drained power supply, improper attachment of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the patient, detachment of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from the patient, and inoperability of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, another auditory indicator, such as annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, may also be included on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is preferably separate from auditory indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and produces a buzzing or other unique sound to indicate error conditions within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, particularly a low or drained power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> User interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> comprises a response button, whereby a patient or clinician can provide an input to wearable defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> simply by pressing the button. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the response button is comprised silicone <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>button <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>paddle <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and foil <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The response button cancels any upcoming defibrillation operation, meaning that, when pressed, the response button terminates a current defibrillation and, in some embodiments of the invention, disarms defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the response button is relatively large, making it easily accessible to the patient, particularly through clothing and the like. In addition, in preferred embodiments of the invention, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> confirms when the response button has been pressed by issuing both audio and visual messages. In operation, the response button is pushed in response to, e.g., a &ldquo;PLEASE RESPOND&rdquo; verbal message so as to confirm patient consciousness or lack thereof. In preferred embodiments of the invention, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a cardiac event recording button which may or may not be separate from the response button, and which is pushed when the patient wants to record occurrence of a cardiac event. It is noted that these two functions are combined during a potential rescue situation; i.e., the patient will want to respond to the defibrillator&apos;s response requests at the same time, possibly recording the occurrence of a cardiac event. Combining these functions into a single button helps train the patient to habitually push the same button whenever there are requests from the defibrillator or cardiac events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a system functional block diagram of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Briefly, the hardware and software functional blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> monitor and analyze patient information (e.g., the patient&apos;s ECG) received from electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to determine if a cardiac rhythm is life threatening and requires defibrillation, and also permits communication to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and personal computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In addition, these blocks within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determine the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance based on information received from the patient via electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and adjust the defibrillation energy accordingly. Alternatively, a predetermined thoracic impedance value may be stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. That predetermined thoracic impedance value may then be retrieved and used to adjust the defibrillation signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Descriptions of these features of the invention were provided above and, therefore, will not be repeated here. It is worth noting, however, that annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> receives power from backup battery <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which is rechargeable, and which is independent of the primary source of power (i.e., power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Backup battery <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provides power to annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the event that power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fails, thereby giving annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> the ability to warn the patient in such an event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, accessory communications block <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, real time clock (hereinafter &ldquo;RTC&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, RTC/RAM backup battery <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, which may or may not be separate from backup battery <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and signal generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In the representative embodiment of the invention described herein, signal generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> comprises processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, charger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and charge control block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In this regard, although the present invention includes the forgoing blocks in signal generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, any combination of hardware and/or software which effects the same function as these features can be employed in the practice of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> RTC <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> maintains the current date and time, receiving power from rechargeable RTC/RAM backup battery <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is powered-off. In preferred embodiments of the invention, RTC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is a Dallas 1306 serial RTC, which is able to maintain the correct time and date for up to 30 days without connection to power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. RTC/RAM backup battery <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> also provides power to a memory (e.g., a RAM (not shown)). Accessory communications block <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> performs any filtering and protocol conversion necessary to enable transmission of data between defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and/or personal computer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> comprises analog signal conditioning hardware which filters and digitizes ECG signals, thoracic impedance measurements, and electrode-to-skin impedance measurements received via electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and which transmits the resulting data to processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also receives information from an accelerometer, described below, relating to the patient&apos;s motion, and provides this information to processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> stores both the operational history of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and information relating to the patient. More specifically, data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> stores abnormal heart activity of the patient; the patient&apos;s ECG before, during and after application of defibrillation energy; an indication that the patient has been trained for use with defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; analyzed ECG conditions; ECG markings, including defibrillation synch, external pace pulse, high slew rate, and saturation; patient thoracic and electrode-to-skin impedance measurements over time; voice, tone, and buzzer prompts; displayed messages; information concerning patient interaction with the defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (e.g., if and when the patient has pressed the response button); transmitted defibrillation waveform measurements, including current and voltage versus time; execution time measurements of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in determining if defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operated as expected; detected operational errors of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (including a type of error, persistence of the error, whether defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was in the operational mode when the error occurred, whether defibrillation had begun when the error occurred, and whether a cardiac arrhythmia had been detected when the error occurred); calibration data for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the serial number of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; a harness identification ID of an electrode harness interfaced to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; cold and warm start information for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; artifact noise in the patient; data from an accelerometer relating to motion of the patient; documentation regarding the defibrillator; instructions on how to use the defibrillator; and patient parameters. These patient parameters include, but are not limited to, the patient&apos;s ID number which is a unique assigned identifier for each patient (range of 1 to 9,999; default&equals;0); the patient&apos;s name; the language used for voice and corresponding text messages; a minimum audio level to which a patient responds; minimum tactile stimulation signal to which a patient responds; maximum tactile stimulation signal for a patient; pacing bradycardia rate&mdash;heartbeat rate below which bradycardia will be declared and pace rescue initiated; pace current level&mdash;current level needed to ensure pace rescue; a ventricular tachycardia rate at which defibrillation energy is to be delivered to the patient (range of 150 to 180 beats per minute (hereinafter &ldquo;bpm&rdquo;)); the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance range, meaning, the impedance range during which defibrillation energy may be transmitted to the patient (range of 15 to 200 ohms); a time and a date at which the defibrillator was issued to the patient; a name of a clinic at an external location (e.g., central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a hospital, a doctor&apos;s office, etc.); a name of a clinician at the external location; and an electrode-to-skin impedance range which is used to determine whether the electrodes are not attached, or are improperly attached, to the patient. Also stored with the patient parameters is a checksum which is used to determine their validity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In summary, data logging memory block essentially stores any information provided to, or transmitted from, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over a predetermined span of time, such as two days. This data is preferably stored in a log format and includes time data specifying a time at which each event occurred. In addition, embedded in the data are validation and synchronization mechanisms for use in detecting areas of corrupted or missing data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has a capacity (e.g., 24 megabytes or 48 megabytes) which is sufficient to record the foregoing information over a 48 hour period of continuous use of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In embodiments of the invention where only a portion of the foregoing information is stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, there may be a corresponding decrease in the size of data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> or a corresponding increase in the available period of use for the device. On the other hand, to achieve a reduction in the required amount of memory space without sacrificing data stored therein, it is possible to compress the data, preferably at a 4-to-1 compression ratio, and then to store the compressed data in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. It is noted that the invention is not limited to compressing the data at a 4-to-1 ratio, and that any compression ratio may be used. Any of a number of well-known compression algorithms, particularly those relating to biological signal compression, may be employed to effect the necessary compression. Compression techniques that result in lossless compression, however, are preferred. In particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is removable, and can be transferred to the base station or to an external location at which point data stored therein may be downloaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Signal generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> generates, based on patient impedance data provided from patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, defibrillation energy which preferably has a bi-phasic waveform may have two phases with substantially identical durations, different durations, or a first phase with a longer duration than a second phase, and having relatively low peak amplitudes over a patient impedance range. A mono-phasic waveform or a truncated exponential waveform having similar characteristics may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a representative example of defibrillation energy generated by signal generator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, waveform <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has two phases <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, each of which has substantially the same durations <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> (i.e., t<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&equals;&tilde;5.4 seconds) and a peak amplitude of less than 23 amperes (i.e. I<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&equals;&tilde;20A). Specifically, the bi-phasic waveform has a 5.37 msec (&plus;/&minus;5%) initial &ldquo;positive&rdquo; phase, followed by a 100 to 300 &mgr;sec zero-potential plateau (i.e., t<highlight><subscript>switch</subscript></highlight>&equals;&tilde;180 &mgr;sec), followed by another 5.37 msec (&plus;/&minus;5%) &ldquo;negative&rdquo; phase. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the amplitude at the end of the pulse is 60 to 80% of its initial value. Of course, the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> merely representative, and waveforms having different values can also be generated by the present invention. In fact, in preferred embodiments of the invention, the duration of each phase of a bi-phasic waveform may be between 4.5 and 6.4 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The waveform corresponding to the defibrillation energy preferably also has a substantially consistent tilt, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In preferred embodiments, the tilt of the defibrillation energy is between 53% and 79%. The present invention provides a way in which to alter this tilt using capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. In this regard, capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> store energy which is discharged to the patient via discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the form of the foregoing defibrillation energy. This energy is discharged as a waveform having the foregoing characteristics. The tilt of the waveform (i.e., the rate of the waveform&apos;s exponential decay) is determined by the &ldquo;RC&rdquo; time constant &tgr; of the circuit used to generate the waveform. In this regard, that circuit&apos;s time constant &tgr; may be altered by switching capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, as described below, so as to alter the overall, combined capacitance value of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Thus, by switching capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in this manner, it is possible to vary the tilt of the waveform and the achieve a low-current waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> To ensure safe operation, the energy for defibrillation energy is discharged by capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> only in the case that a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia is detected in the patient (as determined by comparing the patient&apos;s ECG to pre-stored patient parameters), the patient is deemed to be unconscious (as determined, e.g., by the patient&apos;s response, or lack thereof, to messages provided by auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. and annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>), and the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance is within a predetermined range. In preferred embodiments of the invention, this range is between 15 ohms and 200 ohms. The process of determining whether and when to transmit defibrillation energy to a patient is described in more detail below. One (or more) of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is also used to provide the above-noted tactile stimulation signal to the patient. The tactile stimulation signal may be used to alert the patient of the occurrence of a cardiac event, and may vary based on the patient and based on which time it is administered to the patient in response to a message from the defibrillator. That same capacitor may also be used to deliver a pacing signal to the patient&apos;s heart in order to stimulate normal contractions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The invention preferably includes 5 capacitors having capacitances of 500 &mgr;F (350 V) each; although capacitors having other capacitances may be used as well. The capacitors are switchable into the &ldquo;221&rdquo; configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in which there are two sets of parallel capacitors in series with a single capacitor; the &ldquo;2111&rdquo; configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in which there is one set of parallel capacitors in series with three single capacitors; and the &ldquo;11111&rdquo; configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in which there are five single capacitors in series. In general, the higher the impedance of the patient, the lower the peak current that is required for the defibrillation energy (a lower tilt is also required at higher impedances). Consequently, the higher the impedance of the patient, the lower the capacitance that is required to generate the defibrillation energy. For example, for a patient whose impedance is relatively high (e.g., 120 ohms), the 11111 capacitor configuration may be used to generate defibrillation energy having a maximum peak current of 15 A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In this regard, the lower the impedance of the patient, the higher the capacitance that is required to generate the defibrillation energy. Thus, for patients whose impedance is relatively low (e.g., 40 ohms), the 221 capacitor configuration may be used to generate defibrillation energy having a maximum peak current of 21 A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Table 1, shown below, provides values for I<highlight><subscript>max&plus;</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>avrg&plus;</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>final</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>max&plus;</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>switch</subscript></highlight>, and t<highlight><subscript>max&minus;</subscript></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) for defibrillation energy for patients having impedances of 40, 60, 80 and 120 ohms. These values are merely representative of a particular case, and other values, of course, may be substituted therefor. In this regard, as noted above, the duration of each phase is roughly between 4.5-6.5 msec, and the peak current is roughly between 12 and 25 A.

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In addition to using capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to control the waveform of the defibrillation energy in the foregoing manner, the invention may also include a resistor, placed in series with the capacitors. Due to the resistor&apos;s effect on the circuit&apos;s time constant, the resistor has the effect of &ldquo;smoothing&rdquo;, i.e., decreasing the tilt of, the waveform of the defibrillation energy. In this regard, generally speaking, an increase in the resistance of the resistor decreases the tilt of the waveform. As an alternative to the foregoing configuration, the invention may include a single capacitor and one or more switchable resistors to achieve the effect of varying the circuit&apos;s time constant and thereby varying the waveform of the defibrillation energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As noted above, discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> control delivery of the defibrillation energy from capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to the patient. Discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are controlled by defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which, in turn, is controlled by processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in use, or is not required to provide an output signal, processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> commands defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to open discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, thereby providing protection from unwanted electric signals. On the other hand, when processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> determines that defibrillation energy is to be transmitted to the patient, processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> immediately commands defibrillation block control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to close discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, thereby providing the energy to the patient. In this regard, as noted above, one of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is also able to transmit tactile stimulation and pacing signals to the patient. In a case that a tactile stimulation or a pacing signal, as opposed to the defibrillation energy, is to be transmitted, processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> issues a command to defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which, in response, may switch one of discharge protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> so as to output a signal from only one of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, defibrillator control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> also monitors discharge/protection switches <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and provides the results thereof to processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Charger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> controls charging of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> from power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the input of which is labeled <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Specifically, charger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises hardware which transfers energy from power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Charger control block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> controls charger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in response to commands received from processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> charge to a level commanded by processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this regard, processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may issue commands to charge capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to one of a plurality of different levels depending on a determined type of arrhythmia, e.g., ventricular fibrillation versus ventricular tachycardia. Thus, if a ventricular fibrillation is detected, then a signal having a higher amplitude is output, whereas if a ventricular tachycardia is detected, then a &ldquo;cardio&rdquo; or lower amplitude defibrillation signal is output. Processing block may also issue commands to charge processing block <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> based on a type of signal to be transmitted, e.g., defibrillation energy, a pacing impulse, or a tactile stimulation signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can comprise a microprocessor, controller, or the like, as described below, which includes an internal program memory (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). This memory is used to store software modules comprised of process steps that are executable by processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Specifically, process steps in these modules are executable to control operation of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based on input received from a patient or, alternatively, from base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). These software modules comprise input/output (hereinafter &ldquo;I/O&rdquo;) module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, including communications submodule <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> therein, data recording module <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, diagnostics module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, defibrillation control module <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, user interface protocols <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, and master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> I/O module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a BIOS module which controls the transfer of data between software modules running within processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and hardware components within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. I/O module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also controls communications between processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. To this end, the invention includes user interface protocols <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, between master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and I/O module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. User interface protocols <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> comprise command sequences for controlling transmission of various prompts, such as tones, verbal messages, or the like, to the user via auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in response to detected events, such as a cardiac arrhythmias or the like. Similarly, user interface protocols <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> include command sequences for controlling receipt of signals input by the user via user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (i.e., the response button). Communications submodule <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> controls communications between processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and an interfaced device, such as electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, via accessory communications block <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> also executes a low-level, run time executive (hereinafter &ldquo;RTE&rdquo;) module (not shown), which supports communication between the various software tasks running in processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> comprises process steps which monitor the patient for a predetermined condition based on information provided through electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. ECG analysis module analyzes the patient&apos;s ECG and impedance data provided from sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (via patient measurements circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>), together with other information provided from the patient, including artifact noise and patient motion, in order to determine whether, when, and what types of arrhythmias are present in the patient&apos;s ECG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> More specifically, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> performs any necessary signal processing on the patient&apos;s ECG and thoracic impedance data in order to remove any extraneous data such as may be present due to noise in the patient&apos;s body, including artifact noise or noise caused by patient motion. Assuming that ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is able to remove extraneous noise from the patient&apos;s ECG and impedance data, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> compares the patient&apos;s ECG and thoracic impedance data to the patient parameters stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (e.g., the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance range and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia rates at which defibrillation, pacing or cardio (described below) signals should be administered) in order to determine whether an arrhythmia has occurred. In the case that ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> determines that an arrhythmia has occurred, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> analyzes the patient&apos;s ECG and the patient parameters in order to determine the type of arrhythmia, i.e., whether the arrhythmia comprises ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, bradycardia, or indioventricular rhythms, and whether defibrillation energy should be transmitted to the patient in response to the arrhythmia. Specifically, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> determines if the patient&apos;s rhythm is normal, meaning that the patient has a normal heartbeat, in which case no intervention is required; bradycardia, meaning that the measured heartbeat is less than 5 bpm; ventricular fibrillation which comprises uncoordinated rapid contractions of the heart which replace normal synchronous pumping action, specifically in the heart&apos;s lower chambers; ventricular tachycardia which comprise a threatening heart condition associated with a very rapid heart rate (&gt;150 bpm) but minimum pumping action; marginal ventricular tachycardia (between 120 and 150 bpm&mdash;referred to as &ldquo;walking VTs&rdquo;); noise; and non-determinate signals, which are described below. The invention may use one or more well-known analysis algorithms to make these determinations. However, in preferred embodiments of the invention, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> performs the algorithm shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The algorithm shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> essentially includes three stages, ECG input and prefiltering stage <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, arrhythmia risk assessment stage <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, and therapy decision algorithm stage <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. ECG input and prefiltering stage <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes preconditioning filter step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, during which baseline stabilizer processing, noise filtering, bandpass filtering, and auto-gain control are performed on the patient&apos;s input ECG data. In preferred embodiments, at least some of these functions are performed in hardware in patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (e.g., ECG filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and ECG amplifier <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> described below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Following preconditioning filter step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the ECG data is then transmitted to both rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and fault detection step <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> detects peaks in the patient&apos;s ECG, a beat morphology of the patient&apos;s heart, and a rhythm interval of the patient&apos;s heart. Fault detection step <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> determines a noise level estimate for noise in the patient&apos;s ECG, the electrode quality, meaning connection of electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the patient, and the patient&apos;s ECG signal amplitude. Results from steps <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are provided to preliminary decision matrix <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> which makes a preliminary determination, based on the information provided from steps <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and based on stored patient parameters, whether the patient&apos;s ECG comprises a benign rhythm, a complex rhythm, or a rhythm that constitutes a risk of arrhythmia. This preliminary determination is then provided to periodic arrhythmia review step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Periodic arrhythmia review step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> samples the input ECG data for fixed time intervals (e.g., 10 to 20 seconds), or at variable time intervals for arrhythmias which are preliminarily determined to be complex. This data, along with the preliminary determination made in preliminary decision matrix <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, is then passed along to arrhythmia risk assessment stage <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, specifically to rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> performs segment morphology analysis on data received from periodic arrhythmia review step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and also performs a temporal analysis of the results of the segment morphology analysis. Processing then proceeds to decision matrix <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which either confirms or refutes the preliminary decision made in preliminary decision matrix <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> based on the processed data and stored patient parameters. Specifically, decision matrix <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> either confirms or refutes that the patient&apos;s ECG comprises a benign rhythm, an arrhythmia, or a complex rhythm. Processing then proceeds to therapy decision algorithm stage <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, specifically to rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> processes the patient&apos;s ECG data by performing thereon, a Fourier analysis, a power spectral analysis, spectral analysis extraction, and a multi-variate temporal analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The processed ECG data output from rhythm analysis step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is then provided to noise analysis step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Noise analysis step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> performs adaptive noise discrimination on the processed ECG data, and then performs noise identification and classification so as to characterize noise in the data. For example, the noise may comprise artifact nose, noise from an internal pacemaker, etc. Thereafter, processing proceeds to decision matrix <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. Decision matrix <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> either confirms that the patients ECG is a benign rhythm, in which case decision matrix <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> merely permits continued monitoring of the patient&apos;s ECG, or declares that there is an arrhythmia. The results of decision matrix <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> are then output to therapy decision step <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>, which determines whether to provide defibrillation energy to the patient based on the results of decision matrix <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, together with patient physiologic measurements provided by step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. These physiologic measurements include consciousness detection, hemodynamic assessment, and stimulus response tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the foregoing, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is able to differentiate &ldquo;treatable rhythms&rdquo;, meaning ECG and physiologic analysis results which warrant application of therapy, from &ldquo;non-treatable rhythms&rdquo;, meaning ECG and physiologic analysis results which do not warrant application of therapy. Non-treatable rhythms include normal sinus rhythms, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (with or without bundle branch block), atrial flutter, second and third degree heart block, ventricular ectopy, premature ventricular contractions, and pacing (see below). ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is also capable of recognizing spontaneous organized cardiac rhythms that frequently follow defibrillation, and are associated with the presence of pulse and blood pressure. These rhythms are also classified as non-treatable. Treatable rhythms include ventricular fibrillation (coarse), and high rate ventricular tachycardia that are hemodynamically compromised and result in patient unconsciousness. For ventricular fibrillation, the peak-to-peak amplitude should be greater than 150 &mgr;V for the rhythm to be considered treatable, and for a ventricular tachycardia the patient&apos;s rate must exceed the corresponding patient parameter, namely the patient parameter corresponding to the ventricular tachycardia rate at which defibrillation energy (or a cardio signal (i.e. a low-energy defibrillation signal)) is to be delivered to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> When identifying treatable versus non-treatable rhythms, the foregoing process errs on the side of caution, meaning that it is more likely that the ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> will identify a non-treatable rhythm as treatable, than identify a treatable rhythm as non-treatable. This feature is built into the system as a safety measure, so that the likelihood of misidentifying a life-threatening arrhythmia is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is also able to identify other rhythms. These include non-determinative rhythms and pace rhythms. Pace rhythms correspond to heart rates that are sustained below 30 bpm and which result in patient unconsciousness. These rhythms are treated with a pacing signal, as opposed to a full defibrillation/cardio signal. Non-determinate rhythms comprise rhythms which require additional analysis to make a definitive decision as to whether defibrillation is required in response thereto. Such rhythms may be the result of extraneous artifact noise in the patient&apos;s body caused, e.g., by muscle contractions resulting from movement. In the event that ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is unable to differentiate between extraneous noise and the patient&apos;s ECG, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> notifies master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which, in turn, outputs a message to visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and/or auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is able to determine, based on electrode-to-skin impedance data received from electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the electrode-to-skin impedance range stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, whether and which electrode in electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has become detached from the patient. To this end, patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> preferably monitors separate, identifiable terminals which permits ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to identify inputs from particular electrodes in electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the case that one or more of these electrodes has become detached from the patient, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> passes such information along to master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is also able to determine whether electrodes are attached to the patient&apos;s skin based on thoracic impedance measurements. That is, if the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance is determined to be above a predetermined value, such as 200 ohms, ECG module ascertains that the electrodes are no longer attached to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> also determines the patient&apos;s heart rate and &ldquo;R-wave synchronization trigger&rdquo; based on received ECG information. In this regard, R-waves are present in the patient&apos;s ECG, both intrinsically and, in some cases, due to an internal or external pacemaker. Transmission of defibrillation signal (in this case a cardio signal) to the patient must be synchronized with an R-wave in order to avoid triggering ventricular fibrillation during a vulnerable period of the patient&apos;s ventricles. This vulnerable period occurs during repolarization of the ventricles, and usually begins 30 to 40 msec before the apex of a T-wave in the patient&apos;s ECG, and ends near the apex of the T-wave. If ventricular ischemia is present, the vulnerable period starts approximately at the same time, but may persist for as long as 120 msec after the end of the T-wave. In all cases, however, the onset of the vulnerable period follows the peak of the R-wave by an amount of time that depends on the patient&apos;s heart rate and on the patient&apos;s ECG. The onset ranges from approximately 220 msec at a heart rate of 60 bpm to 120 msec and to as low as 100 msec at a heart rate of 150 bpm. The R-wave synchronization trigger determined by ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is used by master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, described below, to synchronize the defibrillation energy so that the defibrillation energy is not applied during these vulnerable periods. Specifically, defibrillation energy is synchronized so that it is delivered within 60 msec of the patient&apos;s R-wave peak, if one is present. If no R-wave is detected within a 500 msec monitoring window, then the defibrillation energy is transmitted at the end of this window. In determining the R-wave synchronization trigger, ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> disregards stand-alone pacemaker pulses, meaning that only the heart&apos;s reaction to these pulses is factored into determination of the R-wave synchronization trigger, and not the pacemaker pulses themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> integrates patient information from ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, patient responsiveness from user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and outputs to auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow diagram which provides an overview of this aspect of master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>&apos;s operation, including some operational aspects of ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> of the flow diagram, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> receives analysis results from ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, which indicate whether the patient has suffered an arrhythmia, the type of arrhythmia that the patient has suffered, and whether the arrhythmia is life threatening. Master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also receives information concerning the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance. As described below, this information is used to determine the amplitude of the defibrillation energy to be transmitted by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> After step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> receives the ECG analysis results and impedance information, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, which determines whether the analysis results indicate that the patient has suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia. In a case that step S<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> determines that the patient has not suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>. Step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> issues commands to output a message, such as &ldquo;SEE A DOCTOR&rdquo;, to the patient, in the form of audio and visual signals via audio indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, respectively. Thereafter, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case that step S<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> determines that the patient has suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. Step S<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> determines whether other pre-conditions have been met before defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient. Specifically, step S<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> determines whether the patient&apos;s thoracic impedance is within a predetermined range, preferably between 15 and 200 ohms, and whether the patient&apos;s ECG has been confirmed by, e.g., both ECG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and ECG <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> above taking into account artifact noise in the patient&apos;s body. In a case that step S<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> determines that these pre-conditions have been met, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>; otherwise processing proceeds to steps S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> and back to step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight> determines whether the patient is conscious. More specifically, in step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> outputs a message (e.g., a query) such as &ldquo;ARE YOU THERE&rdquo;. This message is output both visually and audibly. After the message is output, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> waits a predetermined period of time for a response signal. This response signal may be input by the patient via user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, specifically, by pressing the response button. In a case that master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> detects the response signal within the predetermined period of time, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> ascertains that the patient is conscious. Since defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not administer defibrillation energy to conscious patients, in this case, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will not cause defibrillation energy to be transmitted to the patient. Instead, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>, in which master control module simply issues instructions to the patient, which can vary depending upon the severity of the arrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Thus, by pressing the response button, transmission of defibrillation energy to the patient is averted. In this regard, transmission of the defibrillation energy can also be averted upon detection of certain errors in the defibrillator, disconnection of electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and removal of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, in a case that master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> does not detect a response signal within the predetermined period of time, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> issues another audio or visual message (e.g., a louder message). After this second message has been transmitted to the patient, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> again waits for a response from the patient. In a case that the patient does not respond to this second message within a predetermined period of time, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> issues a third message to the patient. This message can be a still louder message or can include a tactile stimulation signal which is transmitted via an electrode on the patient. If the patient does not yet respond, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> issues a fourth and final message together with a tactile stimulation signal. In this regard, it is noted that the format of these four messages can vary. For example, verbal messages need not be louder, the tactile stimulation signal can increase in intensity with each message or may be applied at each message, etc. Moreover, there need not be four messages. Rather, there can be more or less messages, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the event that the patient responds to none of the foregoing messages, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> ascertains that the patient is unconscious. In this case, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, in which case master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> immediately thereafter issues a command to defibrillation control module <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> instructing that the defibrillation energy be transmitted to the patient. That is, in preferred embodiments of the invention, as soon as the patient is determined to be unconscious, master control module causes defibrillation energy to be transmitted to the patient immediately, without waiting for further input from the patient, a clinician, or other party. Included with the command to transmit the defibrillation energy is data defining the amplitude and duration of phases in the defibrillation energy. Master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> determines this information based on the measured thoracic impedance of the patient (see, e.g., Table 1 above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, the defibrillator trains patients with periodical tests in use of the response button via a response test training protocol. Clinicians introducing the defibrillator to new patients are able to initiate execution fo the protocol from an attached clinician station (not shown). The same protocols that are be used to periodically test (and train) patients whenever the electrodes are replaced. The protocol is based on first two alert levels (described below) and an imminent response protocol (i.e., when the patient must response to a message from the defibrillator) so that the patient learns and becomes familiar with the first part of the imminent response protocol. The patient learns what the voice message prompt sounds like at Level 1, and learn what the Level 2 combined voice and tactile simulation signal sounds and feels like. The repetition of the Level 2 prompts is to ensure that the patient was given more than enough time to response. The response/test training protocol serves to develop a habitual reaction in the patient to the push response button in response to voice and tactile stimulation signal prompts during a potential rescue situation; regularly expose the patient to the &ldquo;PLEASE RESPOND&rdquo; voice menage prompt at Level 1, Level 2 with tactile stimulation signal if they do not respond to the first prompt; indirectly show the patient that before electrical therapy will be applied to them, they will be exposed to a series of voice and tactile stimulation signals to confirm that the patient is unconscious each time the test is performed, establish that the defibrillator is generating the voice and tactile stimulation prompts and that the patient can hear/feel them, can respond, and the defibrillator is registering the response; each time, record how fast the patient is responding to the prompts; and each time, determine that patient interface is working and, otherwise, declare the defibrillator unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, in a case that a patient is determined to be unconscious, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may also cause a message, such as &ldquo;STAND BACK&rdquo;, to be output prior to defibrillation so as to advise bystanders of an upcoming defibrillation. In this regard, other messages may be provided to bystanders as well. For example, it is possible to output a message such as &ldquo;CALL FOR HELP&rdquo; in the event that a patient wearing the defibrillator is unconscious. Such a message may even be output after defibrillation energy is administered to the patient. In this regard, any number of different types of messages may be included in the invention, which may be output at any time during the defibrillation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In addition to applying defibrillation energy to the patient, master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also determines when it is time to provide a pacing signal to the patient, and applies that signal accordingly. This process is similar to the above process for applying defibrillation energy. That is, in a case that master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> determines that a patient&apos;s heart rate is below 30 bpm and the patient is unconscious, a pacing signal may be applied via the electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Defibrillation control module <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> controls defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and charge control block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in accordance with the command received from master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so that defibrillation energy which is appropriate for the patient can be generated and transmitted to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Regarding the remaining software modules executing within processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, diagnostics module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> performs diagnostics on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relating to the operation and safety thereof prior to transmitting defibrillation energy to the patient. These diagnostics include diagnostics that are performed at power-on of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to determine if there are operational defects therein. In a case that diagnostics module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> detects operational defects as a result of these diagnostics, this information is stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and is transmitted back to master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which alerts the patient. Such information also may be transmitted to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or to personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Data recording module <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> controls transmission of data between defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and computers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This data can include as noted above, abnormal heart activity of the patient; the patient&apos;s ECG before, during and after application of defibrillation energy; analyzed ECG conditions; ECG markings, including defibrillation synch, external pace pulse, high slew rate, and saturation; patient thoracic and electrode-to-skin impedance measurements over time; voice, tone, and buzzer prompts; displayed messages; information concerning patient interaction with the defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; transmitted defibrillation waveform measurements, including current and voltage versus time; execution time measurements of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in determining if defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operated as expected; detected operational errors of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; calibration data for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the serial number of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; a harness identification ID of an electrode harness interfaced to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; cold and warm start information for defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; artifact noise in the patient; data from an accelerometer relating to motion of the patient; and patient parameters. Data recording module <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> also controls storage of the foregoing data in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The hardware components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> include processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, which is comprised of ECG amplifier <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, flash memories <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, program ROM <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, static RAM (hereinafter &ldquo;SRAM&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, backup battery <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, voice chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, LCD circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, processor field programmable gate array (hereinafter &ldquo;FPGA&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, voice driver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, output circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, power supply monitor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, address and data bus <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, crystal oscillator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and RTC <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Also included within defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, transformer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, output circuitry <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, ECG filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, and accelerometer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> perform the functions of processing block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; flash memories <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> perform the functions of data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>; control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs the functions of defibrillation control block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, charge control block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and charger <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, ECG filters <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, accelerometer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and ECG amplifiers <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> perform the functions of patient measurements block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; and control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, together with a serial interface (not shown) and a non contact interface (not shown), perform the functions of accessory communications block <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Remaining hardware components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> that perform the functions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are self-evident </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The hardware components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are all tied to an internal, &ldquo;floating&rdquo; ground during operation of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This means that there are no connections to an external ground when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interfaced to a patient (although there may be external ground connections when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interfaced to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The use of floating grounds during operation of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is important from the patient&apos;s perspective, since it reduces the chances of unwanted electric shock to the patient. This floating ground may be on power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which was described above. A detailed description of power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is therefore omitted here for the sake of brevity. Suffice it to say that power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides power to all components on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Accelerometer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> measures a patient&apos;s motion and provides this information to processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> via control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> analyzes the information received from accelerometer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, stores information relating to patient motion, and uses this information in its calculations of artifact noise noted above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> receives signals from each of sensing electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, negative and positive inputs from power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a connector ID from an interfaced device. Input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> also controls output of defibrillation, tactile stimulation and pacing signals to a patient. To this end, included within input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are a plurality of switches, one corresponding to each input/output. These switches open and close in response to instructions from processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> so as to ensure that signals, such as the defibrillation energy, are not inadvertently transmitted to a patient. Input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> also includes shielding and the like on its input/output signal lines so as to reduce the chances of damage to defibrillation circuitry during application of defibrillation energy to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Signals received from input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are transmitted to ECG filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. ECG filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> comprises plurality of bandpass filters used to filter signals received from electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. These filtered signals are transmitted to ECG amplifier <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. ECG amplifier <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes amplifying circuitry for amplifying the filtered signals received from ECG filter <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, and an analog-to-digital converter for converting the amplified signals from analog form into digital form. These digital signals are then transmitted to processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> via processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> receives clocking signals from crystal oscillator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which preferably provides signals up to 40 MHz. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can comprise a microprocessor, microcontroller, or the like, and is used to execute the software modules-described above so as to control operation of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Examples of microprocessors which have been identified as suitable for use with the present invention include the Intel <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> processor family, Intel 386EX (386EXTB), TMS320F206, Motorola 68332, the TI &ldquo;2&times;3&rdquo; family DSP Processor, Amtel 8051 or equivalent, Hitachi 8/500 series, Mitsubishi M37700, and Motorola 68HC16, to name a few. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> also controls the application of power to other components in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, particularly those on processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and is able to cause these components to be powered-up and powered-down for predetermined time intervals. This feature of the invention reduces the amount of power consumed by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As another power saving feature, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is capable of operating in different modes, during which processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> consumes different amounts of power. Specifically, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is operable in a normal mode, during which processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> samples data from electrodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and controls defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the manner described herein. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is also operable in a low-power mode. In some embodiments of the invention, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be turned off completely. In preferred embodiments, however, most processing in processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> ceases, but some elementary routines remain running. During the low-power mode, all internal registers in processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> retain their data, thereby making it possible for processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to resume normal operation upon re-entering the normal mode. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> enters the low-power mode periodically, e.g., at intervals of 1 to 2 ms, for predetermined periods of time, e.g., 20 ms. Alternatively, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can operate in the low-power and normal modes at equal intervals, such as every 4 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, the length of time that processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> operates in the low-power mode is variable based on information received from the patient or, alternatively, based on information received from central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. For example, if processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines based, e.g., on the patient&apos;s ECG and previous history, that the patient is at a relatively low risk for a cardiac arrhythmia, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can lengthen the period of the low-power mode. Likewise, if processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines, based on similar information, that the patient is at a high risk for an arrhythmia, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> can shorten, or even eliminate, the low-power mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the low power mode is that the amount of power consumed therein may be varied. For example, in a case that processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines that benign rhythms have occurred for a relatively long time, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may enter a &ldquo;deep&rdquo; low power mode, in which processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is off, or in which only the most elementary of routines remain running. On the other hand, in a case that processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines that a treatable rhythm occurred recently, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may enter a &ldquo;light&rdquo; low power mode, in which less power is consumed than when the processor operates in the normal mode, but in which more than just elementary routines remain running in the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> To enter the low-power mode, in preferred embodiments of the invention, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> simply executes an &ldquo;IDLE&rdquo; instruction, during which most internal processing in processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is disabled. In response to this IDLE instruction, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> stops its internal clock and may execute only low-level routines so as to perform minimal tasks, such as determining when it is time to re-enter the normal mode. To this end, in the low-power mode, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, via control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (described below), monitors signals received from RTC <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and, based on these signals, determines when it is time to re-enter the normal mode. In a case that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a button or the like (not shown) on its user interface for placing processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in the normal mode manually, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> also monitors such a button during the low-power mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Flash memories <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> comprise removable EPROMs or the like. Program ROM <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> stores the software modules described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> which are executed by processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Static RAM <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> comprises a memory out of which those software modules may be executed. As described above, SRAM <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is backed-up by backup battery <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. In this regard, backup battery <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> contains a rechargeable lithium coin cell battery which is sufficient to back up both RTC <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and SRAM <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Battery backup <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> may also be used to supply power to power annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a second backup battery (not shown) may be used for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> monitors processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in order to determine if either processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> or control FPGA has lost program control. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> outputs a square wave signal called WATCHDOG_OUT in a case that control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are communicating properly. Reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> monitors this signal for variations therein. In a case that this signal is interrupted, or has an unexpected waveform, reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> ascertains that there has been a system malfunction. As another example, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is programmed to generate a signal called CONTROL_PLD_FAULT in a case that control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has failed. Reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> monitors for this signal as well in order to ascertain if there has been a failure in control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the event that either processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> or control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has failed, a system reset will be attempted by reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If the problem persists, reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will instruct output circuit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to output an alarm, e.g., a &ldquo;tone&rdquo; or a &ldquo;buzzing&rdquo; via annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In this regard, in the event of a system error which causes a reset to be asserted, an alarm will not be sounded immediately. That is, if the system successfully recovers after one reset, no alarm will be sounded. This design allows the system to rebound from a temporary fault without alerting the user unnecessarily. If, however, a persistent fault condition exists which reasserts itself for at least 200 msec per second, the alarm is sounded for 5 to 10 seconds. If the system subsequently recovers, the alarm will cease to sound at the conclusion of this 5 to 10 second period; otherwise, the alarm will continue as long as the system reset signal is asserted for 200 msec or more per second, stopping only when the backup battery for annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has been drained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The system will also reset itself if power output by power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> drops below a predetermined level or goes above a predetermined level. To determine if power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has gone below or above these predetermined levels, power supply monitor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> monitors power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In preferred embodiments of the invention, power supply monitor comprises plural comparators with associated circuitry for making these determinations. In a case that power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is low, or is outputting greater than a predetermined amount of power, this information is transmitted to reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In response, reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> causes annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to output an alarm via output circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In a case that power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has failed, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> shuts down defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> just after reset/watchdog circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has caused annunciator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to output the alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> also includes control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which comprise glue logic for controlling inputs to, and outputs from, processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains memory page registers, glue logic, and processor internal clock stopping/starting circuitry. This clock stopping/starting circuitry stops an internal clock of processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for predetermined periods of time, such as 4 msec, during processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>&apos;s low-power modes. Processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> also controls outputs to LED <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and visual indicator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). In this regard, interfaced to processor FPGA <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is voice chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, e.g., an ISD33000 series Chip Voice Record/Playback device which can store up to 60 seconds of prerecorded voice messages. Voice driver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is also required to drive auditory indicator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. An example of such a driver is a TI TPA4861D (SOIC-8). Defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes LCD controller/driver <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which, in preferred embodiments of the invention, is an OKI MSM6555B or MISM6665 chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> contains a defibrillator state machine and various registers for controlling operations of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Among these registers are capacitor configuration registers (not shown). By writing into these registers, capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> can be programmed to enable different capacitor configurations, i.e., the 221, 2111 or 11111 configurations shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. More specifically, control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes CAP_SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, CAP_SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CHRGELCB and CHARGE registers. Writing a &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the CHARGE register enables capacitor charging, whereas writing a &ldquo;0&rdquo; into the CHARGE register disables charging. Writing a &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the CHRGELCB register switches all capacitors into a parallel configuration for charging, whereas writing a &ldquo;0&rdquo; into the CHRGELCB register charges only one of capacitors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and allows that one of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to be placed into a series configuration for transmitting a tactile stimulation or pacing signal. Writing a &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the CAP_SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> register switches two of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> into a series configuration, whereas writing a &ldquo;0&rdquo; into CAP_SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> register switches the two of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> into a parallel configuration. Writing a &ldquo;1&rdquo; into the CAP_SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> register switches two others of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> into a series configuration, whereas writing a &ldquo;0&rdquo; into CAP_SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> register switches the two others of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> into a parallel configuration. Thus, values in CAP_SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CAP_SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> control the configuration of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> during a defibrillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of other registers as well, including a defibrillator control register. Bits are written to the defibrillator control register to set defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide either defibrillation energy, a tactile stimulation signal, or a pacing signal. Control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also has a number of other functions, including monitoring the charge in capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and adjusting the charge based on signals (e.g., patient impedance) received from an interfaced device such as electrode harness <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, monitoring inputs from user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, e.g., the response button, and providing output via a serial interface (not shown) to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and via a non-contact interface (not shown) to personal computer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As noted above, outputs from control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, namely CAPSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CAPSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, control switching of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> from the 11111 configuration into the 2111 and 221 configurations. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a detailed circuit diagram of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> (and of transformer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). In preferred embodiments of the invention, the circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> fits on a circuit board having a surface area of roughly 2 inches<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or less. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are charged by power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via transformer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. CAPSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls switching of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>via transistor switch <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, whereas CAPSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> controls switching of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>via transistor switch <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As noted above, this switching controls the overall, combined capacitance of <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>which affects the amplitude and the tilt of a waveform output therefrom. Additional signal conditioning and output circuitry is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> but, since this particular circuitry is not essential to the invention, a detailed description thereof has been omitted for the sake of brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> It is worth noting, however, that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> also shows circuitry <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which is used to output tactile stimulation and pacing signals from capacitor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, PACEP and TENSP, which are output by control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, control application of the pacing and tactile stimulation and signals, respectively, from capacitor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>That is, charge from capacitor <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>namely CAP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;<highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, is applied to circuitry <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and processed for output as the pacing or tactile stimulation signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> also shows the CHARGELCB signal, which was described above, and ISNSCB and IDSNSCB signals. The ISNSCB signal comprises a current sense signal which is used to determine the charge of capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, whereas the IDSNSCB signal is used to determine the defibrillation energy current. This information is passed back to processor board <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, which processes this information and responds in the manner described above. For example, in the event that processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines that capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> are charged excessively for a particular patient such that over-current or even over-time defibrillation could occur, defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be shut down or temporarily disabled so that capacitors <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> can be discharged without harm to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, output circuitry <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes signal conditioning circuitry as well as control circuitry which ensures that defibrillation energy will not be output inadvertently. In this regard, the invention also includes other safety features which limit transmission of the defibrillation control signal. For example, prior to delivery of the defibrillation energy, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> monitors and demonstrates that state control clocks controlling the defibrillation energy are operational, and also tests the hardware components in order to detect any single point failures therein. These tests include testing switches in input circuitry <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, through which the defibrillation energy is transmitted. These switches are tested, one at a time, to demonstrate that each switch is capable of holding off a full magnitude of the defibrillation energy. At each step of this switch test, a voltage across each transistor (i.e., switch) is monitored to record a test voltage and to record a transistor gate drive time constant in addition to combined opto isolator and transistor turn-off times. These voltages are then used to measure patient voltage during application of the defibrillation energy. Upper transistor switches, through which the defibrillation energy is transmitted, are tested first, followed by lower transistor switches. Each transistor switch is monitored and tested to demonstrate that the defibrillation energy would be terminated independently of hardware control timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In addition, as noted above, two pre-conditions must be met before defibrillation energy is transmitted the patient, namely, (i) the patient has experienced a treatable rhythm and (ii) the patient is unconscious. When these two conditions occur, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> arms the defibrillation controller, e.g., control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Specifically, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> provides the following sequence of control signals to initiate arming of the defibrillation controller. First, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> tests its own internal safety signal (&ldquo;PD_SAFE&rdquo;) to demonstrate its ability to override any hardware defibrillation control signals. Processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> then confirms that defibrillation energy can be detected properly by activating test signals and reading current feedback signals based on these test signals. Master control module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, executing within processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, sets a &ldquo;defibrillator arm request status&rdquo; bit in memory for use and checking by an executive control module (not shown). This executive control module monitors operation of the software and updates a watchdog timer in processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> (which outputs the WATCHDOG_OUT signal noted above) when the software is confirmed to function properly. The executive control module then sets an arm request signal in the defibrillation controller and calls a watchdog update subroutine which transitions the signal output from the watchdog timer. This causes a watchdog timer update and transitions the &ldquo;armed request&rdquo; status to the &ldquo;armed&rdquo; status in the defibrillation controller. The PD_SAFE signal is then put in the active state to allow the activation of hardware control signals for defibrillation therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Next, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> provides a final synchronized trigger signal to the defibrillation controller for delivery of the defibrillation energy. This synchronized trigger signal will be accepted only after the &ldquo;armed&rdquo; status has been established. The defibrillation controller will clear the armed status if the synchronization trigger signal is not provided within a 500 msec time period, thereby providing a limited acceptable period for defibrillation therapy. In a case that the defibrillation energy is transmitted to the patient, following transmission thereof, processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> determines if the defibrillation energy was transmitted properly. In this regard, defibrillation energy dosage errors of over-current are protected by the reset/watchdog circuit described above, but, if such an event does inadvertently occur, a fault condition is retained in a hardware fault register. Similarly, under-dosages of the defibrillation energy are also detected and stored. In addition to being stored, these and other defibrillator operational errors may be transmitted to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Diagnostics module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> also performs a plurality of diagnostics on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to test defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&apos;s hardware. These diagnostics include cold start diagnostics, which are executed when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> powers-up normally, warm start diagnostics which are executed when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> experiences transient reset or power loss, runtime diagnostics which are continuing, periodic tests performed in the background of normal operating conditions, and specific conditions diagnostics which are tests that are performed prior to, or when certain operations are performed, such as transmission of defibrillation energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Cold start diagnostics include RAM test, ROM test, D/A and A/D converter tests, FPGA tests, RTC and ECG sampling rate tests, LCD tests, voice circuitry tests, backup battery voltage tests, primary power supply voltage tests, internal voltage tests, old electrode harness test (i.e., whether the electrode harness has been changed after transmission of defibrillation energy), safety tests so as to verify that safety controls are operational, watchdog timer tests, shutdown tests, and patient parameters validation. Warm start diagnostics include operational state data tests (protected RAM validation) and patient parameters validation. Runtime diagnostics include watchdog timer active tests so as to confirm that a clock signal is active, software clock to real time clock comparison tests, software execution times checks, system voltage tests so as to test if the system is within voltage specifications, A/D runtime reference voltage tests, backup battery voltage tests, primary power supply voltage tests, internal voltage tests, old electrode harness test, operational state data integrity test, operational temperature tests, lead off tests, stuck keys test, safety tests including electrode harness time limit tests, defibrillation capacitor voltage tests, defibrillation output circuitry tests, output voltage tests, patient parameter validation, and impedance measurements. Specific conditions diagnostics include tests which are performed prior to transmission of defibrillation energy to the patient. These tests include cross checking processor tests whereby control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> checks processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for correct performance of a command sequence, and processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> checks control FPGA <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for correct progression of states during set-up and transmission of defibrillation energy. Other tests include a watchdog timer test which resets the system in a case that processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> fails to respond periodically, electrodes-off tests in which processor <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> confirms that electrodes are attached to the patient, operational therapy state data integrity tests, pre-therapy dosage tests whereby energy to be transmitted as defibrillation energy is compared with two impedance measurements prior to transmission, stuck ECG relay contacts tests (prior to defibrillation), H-bridge therapy tests, and delivered defibrillation current limiting tests. </paragraph>

Communication between the defibrillator and the base station may be via an RF, IR, or direct electrical connection. In addition, communication/testing may be effected by direct contact between the sensing electrodes and the base station. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> External interface comprises a link to an external location, such as central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or a personal computer, over which patient and defibrillation information is transmitted to the external source, and over which the external information is received from the external source. External interface can comprise a modem link, a network connection, or the like, over which data may be transmitted to and from base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At this point, it is noted that all information stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> above can be transmitted over defibrillator interface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and external interface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> comprises a microprocessor or the like, which is capable of executing stored program instructions so as to control operation of base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Any type of processor may be employed, such as those described above with respect to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Program instructions that can be executed by controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> are stored in program memory <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Program memory <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an EPROM, or the like, which can be reprogrammed with newly-received information or routines by controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Patient parameters <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> correspond to the patient parameters described above and, as noted, can be reprogrammed based on information, such as instructions, provided from an external source. Control module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is executed so as to control transfer of information between defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Diagnostics module <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> comprises a module which performs various safety diagnostics on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is interfaced to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. By way of example, control module <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be executed to retrieve information relating to operational errors of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Diagnostics module <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may then use this information to target-test components and/or software on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that may be responsible for these errors. Alternatively, diagnostics module <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may perform a complete safety diagnostic check on all aspects of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> each time defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mated to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In this regard, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is capable of performing diagnostics comprising an audio test to confirm that messages and tones output by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are clearly audible; measurement tests to confirm that all measurements in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> needed to perform a defibrillation procedure are as expected; ECG analysis tests so as to confirm that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to detect and differentiate various cardiac arrhythmias; defibrillation waveform tests so as to confirm that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can generate and output a waveform appropriate for a patient having a particular impedance; patient leakage current tests so as to confirm that leakage current in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not above an acceptable level; over-dosage defibrillation tests so as to confirm that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will automatically terminate an over-current defibrillation (e.g., I<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&gE;30 A) and an over-time defibrillation (e.g., t<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&gE;20 msec); under-dosage defibrillation tests so as to determine if defibrillator is providing an under-current defibrillation (e.g., I<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>is less than a required current for a patient&apos;s impedance measurement by more than 20%) or an under-time defibrillation (e.g., t<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>is less than a required duration for a patient&apos;s impedance measurement by more than 20%); power consumption tests so to confirm that defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> meets with the power requirements set forth in Table 2 below; and button switch tests to confirm that each button on user interface <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is operating properly.

<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Diagnostics module <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may also be executed to check proper transmission of patient parameters or other programming information from base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, in operation, base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives new patient parameters over external interface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> from central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and transmits these patient parameters over defibrillator interface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Diagnostics module <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may then be executed to issue a request for the patient parameters stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> over defibrillator interface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, to receive the patient parameters therefrom over defibrillator interface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and to compare the patient parameters, including a checksum, to the same patient parameters, which are stored in program memory <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, so as to verify valid receipt of the patient parameters by defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, the results of the foregoing diagnostics may be transmitted back to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to warn the user of the defects via, e.g., an LCD or a speaker. In addition, the results of such diagnostics may also be transmitted to an external location via external interface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for analysis or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also includes RAM <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, out of which controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> executes program instructions stored in program memory <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, which stores information received from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and from an external source. Non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can comprise an NVRAM, battery backed-up RAM, EPROM, or the like, and has a storage capacity which is the same as or greater than that of data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This is preferable, since non-volatile memory <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> should be capable of storing any information downloaded to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including all or part of the information described above that is stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, i.e., abnormal heart activity of the patient, the patient&apos;s ECG before, during and after application of defibrillation energy, etc. In this regard, upon connection of defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to defibrillator interface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, in preferred embodiments of the invention, controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> requests defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to upload data stored in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and, if the data has been uploaded successfully, controller <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> requests defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to reset all recorded data in data logging memory block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and also to clear patient parameters stored therein to their default settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> As noted above, it is possible to reprogram defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with information received from the external location. In fact, it is even possible to use information received from defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to affect such reprogramming. More specifically, information relating to patients using the same type of defibrillator, i.e., defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&apos;s type, is stored in central repository <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This information can be analyzed in order to test algorithms used in defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. One such algorithm that may be tested is an algorithm used by ECG analysis module <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> above to detect irregular heart activity. Once this algorithm is tested based on analysis results from plural defibrillators, it is possible to pinpoint errors in the algorithm, and to correct these errors. Thereafter, the corrected algorithm can be transmitted back to base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as well as to a plurality of other base stations. In this regard, central repository may identify base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as corresponding to defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based on defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&apos;s ID number. Base station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can then reprogram defibrillator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the corrected algorithm. As a result the invention provides a means by which to improve its performance based on information collected thereby. </paragraph>
