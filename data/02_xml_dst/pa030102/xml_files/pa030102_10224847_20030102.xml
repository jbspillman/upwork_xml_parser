<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to the field of improved microlens molds and microlens. More particularly, the invention concerns a method of making a precision mold suitable for forming high quality, micro-sized optical articles, such as a microlens or microlens array. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Rotationally symmetric optical surfaces in molds for injection molding or compression molding are typically made either by grinding or diamond turning. While these techniques work well for larger surfaces, they are not suited for making high quality optical surfaces in small sizes or arrays. Other techniques are available for making small scale single lenses and arrays but they are limited as to fill factor, optical accuracy and/or the height or sag of the lens geometry that can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Grinding relies on an orbital motion of the grinding surfaces to make a precision optical surface without scratches. However, the orbital motion and the grinding surfaces become impractical when making optical surfaces below a few millimeters in size. Grinding multiple surfaces for an array can only be done one surface at a time with multiple pieces that are then fit together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Diamond turning can be used to make optical surfaces down to 2 millimeters in size but the setup is difficult. Precise location of multiple optical surfaces is not possible due to multiple setups. The need for multiple setups also increases the machining time for an array so that diamond turning becomes cost prohibitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another technique that is suitable for making microlenses under 2 millimeters is polymer reflow. Polymer reflow is done by depositing drops of polymer onto a surface and then heating the polymer to allow it to melt and reflow into a spherical shape under the influence of surface tension effects. In order to obtain a truly spherical optical surface, reflow lenses must be separated from one another so that they contact the underlying surface in a round pattern. To maintain round pattern of each lens at the surface, the lenses must be separated from one another which substantially limits the fill factor in an array. U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,455, titled, &ldquo;Method Of Manufacturing Lens Array,&rdquo; by Aoyama, et al., Jul. 16, 1996, describes a two step approach for making reflow lens array with a high fill factor. Using this technique, a second series of lenses is deposited in the gaps between the first set of lenses. While this technique can provide a near 100% fill factor, the second set of lenses does not have round contact with the underlying surface so that the optical surface formed is not truly spherical. Also, reflow techniques in general are limited to less than 100 microns sag due to gravity effects. Aspheric surfaces cannot be produced using polymer reflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Grayscale lithography is also useable for making microlenses under 2 millimeters. Grayscale lithography can be used to make nearly any shape and high fill factors can be produced in lens arrays. However, reactive ion beam etching and other etching techniques that are used in gray scale lithography are limited as to the depth that can be accurately produced with an optical surface, typically the sag is limited to under 30 micron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> High sag lenses are typically associated with high magnification or high power refractive lenses that are used for imaging. High power refractive lenses have tight curvature and steep sides to maximize the included angle and associated light gathering or light spreading which implies a high sag. In the case of image forming, refractive lenses are preferred to preserve the wave front of the image. In other cases such as illumination where the wave front does not have to be preserved, Fresnel or diffractive lenses where the optical curve is cut into segmented rings, can be used to reduce the overall sag of the lens. In the case of microlenses, high power diffractive lenses are not feasible due to the steepness and narrow spacing of the ring segments at the edge that would be required to make a low sag, high power microlens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,519,539, titled, &ldquo;Microlens Array With Microlenses Having Modified Polygon Perimeters,&rdquo; by Hoopman et al., May 21, 1996 and 5,300,263, titled, &ldquo;Method Of Making A Microlens Array And Mold,&rdquo; by Hoopman et al., Apr. 5, 1994, describe a method for making lens arrays that involves casting a polymer into a series of small receptacles so that surface tension forms the polymer surfaces into nearly spherical shapes. A correction is done on the shape of the receptacles to make the surfaces more closely spherical but this results in football-shaped intersections so that optical quality and the effective fill factor are limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need persists in the art for a method of making a precision microlens mold suitable for forming high quality, micro-sized optical articles, such as a microlens or a microlens array. </paragraph>
</section>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably mounted for movement relative to fixed forming element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> forms a single microlens mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed above. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, however, apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted for three-dimensional movement for forming a microlens mold array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Flexibly moveable substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is operably connected to control member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that governs the movements of substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The control member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in this case preferably has the ability of precision controlled movement of substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the directions X-Y-Z as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Precision air bearing lathes with precision X-Y-Z table movement are available from Precitech, Inc., located in Keene, N.H. The X-Y-Z table movement of control member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is used to produce the flexible movements of substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> relative to forming element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A tool holder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> fixedly attached to rotating control member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, such as the ones described above, having diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (as described above) is positioned for milling microlens array mold <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By having a movable substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an array of microlens mold cavities can be formed in substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Movable substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is first positioned to mill one of a plurality of microlens mold cavities <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the microlens array mold <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. After forming the one of a plurality of microlens mold cavities <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>forming element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is removed from the mold cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and then the substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is moved laterally (X-Y) by control member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to another position for forming another microlens mold cavity <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>This procedure is repeated until the desired number of microlens mold cavities in the microlens array mold <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed in substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, by repeating these steps, apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a movable substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can produce a high quality microlens array mold <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, such as those illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any rotationally symmetric optical surface, such as a microlens surface, can be produced in the manner described. Spherical surfaces are produced using a half radius diamond with a circular segment diamond. Aspheres can be produced by using a diamond with an aspheric cutting edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Moreover, some rotationally non-symmetric lens surfaces, such as anamorphic surfaces, can be made using a modified version of the technique described. In this case, the diamond tooling is moved laterally during the cutting action to create an elongated version of the spherical or aspheric surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Skilled artisans will appreciate that in order to obtain a high quality lens surface, it is important to follow some basic machining concepts. To minimize the center defect in the lens surface produced, it is important to center the diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The quality of microlens mold <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is best achieved if the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (respectively) is centered to better than 5 microns relative to the axis of rotation (not shown) of the tool holder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in rotating control member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>). Also, the tool holder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> must be balanced to eliminate vibration to minimize chatter. Solid platform <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> helps to promote stability of apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> during operation. Further, the right combination of diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> rotational speed, feed, i.e., the rate that diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> penetrates substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and lubrication must be used to obtain the cleanest cut. Moreover, according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, forming element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, shown with diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (similar to those described), must be produced in such a manner that a sufficient clearance <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided on the back side <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to avoid drag marks on substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Drag marks (not shown) typically result from interference of the backside <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> with the substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during the formation of microlens mold <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By using the method of the invention, spherical microlens molds have been made down to 30 microns in diameter with irregularity of better than 0.50 wave (0.25 micron). Further, microlens mold arrays have been made up to 80&times;80 microlenses with a 250 micron pitch in an orthogonal layout and a near 100% fill factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it should be appreciated that the repeated milling process of the invention (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is well suited for making accurate microlens arrays. Since the process for making each microlens in the array is unconnected to the other lenses in the array, a nearly 100% fill factor can be obtained in the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, aspheric lens surfaces can also be produced using this technique. In this case, an aspheric diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is all that is required to make rotationally symmetric aspheric lens surfaces. Anamorphic lens surfaces can be made as well using a modified version of this technique. In this case, the same or similar diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is moved laterally during the cutting operation to produce an elongated lens surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The precision molds <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) made with the methods and apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the invention, can be used to manufacture large numbers of optical articles, such as microlenses. Generally, injection molding and compression molding are the preferred molding methods for forming the typically glass or plastic microlenses. In some cases casting is the preferred method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</cross-reference>, the apparatus used for injection molding or compression molding of plastic microlenses using the microlens molds mounted into a mold base is illustrated. Apparatus for molding a two-sided microlens array <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is composed of two large blocks or mold bases <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> each having an active molding face <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Mold bases <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are comprised typically of steel or other metal. Alignment members arranged on molding faces <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> include guide pins <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, tapered locating bushings <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and corresponding apertures (not shown) for receiving guide pins <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and tapered locating bushings <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The microlens molds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the mold cavities <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> were made according to the methods and apparatus of the invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in operation, the apparatus <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> comprises mold bases <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which are installed into one of two platens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of a hydraulic, pneumatic or electrically driven press <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. One side of the apparatus <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is connected to one platen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the press <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the other side is connected to the other platen <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. When the press closes, the guide pins <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> help to align the two sides of the mold base <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. At the final closing, the tapered locating bushings <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> align the two sides of the mold base <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the microlens molds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with each other. In the case of molding a two-sided microlens array, it is very important that the microlens surfaces on the opposing sides are aligned with each other. To aid with the alignment of the opposing microlens surfaces in each of the sides of the mold base <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the microlens molds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are typically made on square substrates <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) so that they cannot rotate in the mold base <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the case of injection molding, after the press and mold base have been closed, molten plastic is injected under pressure into the mold cavity. After the plastic has cooled in the mold to the point that it has solidified, the press and mold base are opened and the molded microlens array is removed from the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the case of compression molding, prior to the press closing, a hot plastic preform is inserted into the heated mold cavity. The press and mold base is then closed which compresses the plastic preform and forms the plastic to the shape of the mold cavity and microlens array mold. The mold and plastic is then cooled, the press and mold base is opened and the molded microlens array is removed from the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In an alternate case in which a one-sided microlens array or single microlens is being injection or compression molded, the opposing side from the microlens mold is typically a plano surface and then, since side-to-side and rotational alignment is not an issue, the microlens mold may be made onto a round substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the microlens array mold <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) with a square substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as is typically used to prevent rotation of the microlens array mold surface <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in the mold base <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of apparatus <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The microlens array mold surface <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the depth of the mold cavity <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and the thickness of the molded microlens array article are determined precisely by adjusting the overall height of the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the height of the larger round substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In cases where casting is the preferred method of production, the material is simply poured into the mold cavity and allowed to solidify by chemical reaction rather than cooling. After the part has solidified, the part is removed from the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is our experience that microlens molds made according to the invention have been used to injection mold microlens surfaces in which the sag is not limited, as indicated below. Further, near hemispheric lenses can be produced with very steep sidewalls. Also, it is our experience that optical surfaces can be machined directly into mold materials such as nickel, copper, aluminum, brass, nickel plating, or silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Since apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a forming element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (respectively) is quite accurate, it is our experience that lens surfaces can be produced in sizes down to 10 micron or less in diameter and 2 micron sag. Lenses up to 25 mm in diameter are also possible with sags of over 12.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The following are several exemplary examples of microlenses made with the method and apparatus of the invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A microlens array mold with 80&times;80 microlenses was made in aluminum. The half radius diamond tool was obtained from ST&amp;F Precision Technologies and Tools, located in Arden, N.C. The microlens surfaces were 0.250 mm across positioned in a square intersection array. The microlenses surfaces were spherical in curvature with a radius of 0.500 mm and a sag of 33 micron. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, centering of the diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the control member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> was done using an iterative process where a test cut was examined under the microscope and adjustments of the location of diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> were made based on the size of the center defect. Rotational speed of diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> used was about 1000 rpm. Cutting fluid was purified mineral oil. The result of this process was a center defect of the machined mold of 2 micron and surface irregularity of 1 Wave (0.5 micron). Parts were subsequently injection molded, using the machined mold surface, to produce polymethylmethacrylate microlens arrays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Similar to Example 1 with the exception that a hardened nickel-plated substrate was used for the machined mold surface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A microlens array mold with 13&times;13 microlenses surfaces was made in a hardened nickel-plated substrate. The microlens surfaces were 1.30 mm across positioned in a square intersection array. The half radius diamond tool was obtained from ST&amp;F Precision Technologies and Tools, located in Arden, N.C. The microlens surfaces were spherical in curvature with a radius of 3.20 mm and a sag of 213 micron. Centering and the machining process were the same as described in Example 1. The result was a center defect of 1.5 micron with a surface irregularity of 0.30 Wave (0.15 micron). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A series of single microlens surfaces was made in a 715 nickel alloy substrate. The microlens surfaces all were made with a 0.500 mm radius diamond tool. Diameters varied from 0.062 mm to 0.568 mm. The machining process was similar to that described in Example 1. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A larger microlens array of 63.5&times;88.9 mm was made with 21,760 microlenses in total in a 125&times;175 square intersection array. A diamond half radius tool with a 0.5008 mm radius was used, obtained from Chardon Tool, Inc., located in Chardon, Ohio. The array was made with a 0.50932 pitch and a 0.16609 sag. The substrate was nickel-plated steel. The machining process was similar to that described in Example 1. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is also within the contemplation of the invention that by machining matched optical surfaces for a mold, two-sided microlens arrays can be molded in large numbers. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, two matched microlens array surfaces were made in hardened nickel-plated substrates. The half radius diamond tool or diamond cutting member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) was obtained from Contour Fine Tooling, Inc., located in Marlborough, N.H. The microlens surfaces were made with a 1.475 mm radius and a 0.750 mm pitch in a square intersection pattern, the sag was 99 micron. The machining process was similar to that described in Example 1. A center defect of 2 micron and an irregularity of 0.3 Wave (0.15 micron) were achieved in the machined surface. In this case, the two matched microlens array surfaces were mounted in a mold base so that they were opposed. To align the microlens surfaces on each side, the microlens surfaces were machined into square substrates prior to mounting into a mold base thereby inhibiting rotational misalignment. Taper lock bushings were then used to prevent lateral misalignment. Following this process, two-sided microlens arrays were injection molded from polymethylmethacrylate. The molded microlenses on the two-sided array were aligned with each other within 30 micron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. However, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications can be effected by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention.
