<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a cutting and clamping mechanism, and more particularly to a cutting and clamping mechanism for use in obstetrics for severing and clamping an umbilical cord. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cutting assemblies are well known in the art. For example, reference may be made to the following U.S. patent documents: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,631,858; 4,716,886; 4,938,215; 5,046,252; 5,190,556; 5,584,840; 5,667,516; 5,676,672; 5,913,862; 5,937,523; 5,968,054; and 5,997,548. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The severance of an umbilical cord occurs shortly after birth. The umbilical cord functions to provide a fetus with oxygen and nutrients during the gestation period. Once a child has been born, the umbilical cord needs to be severed. In the regard, an obstetrician, or other practitioner tends to this task by first clamping the cord to reduce blood flow and then severs the cord, thus freeing the fetus from the mother. At the moment before the umbilical cord is severed, it is engorged with blood under pressure from both the mother and the fetus and thus, when severed blood and amniotic fluid escape and flow onto the gloved hands of the obstetrician. Such fluids on the gloved hands of the obstetrician become very slippery and thereby increased risk of an accident, such as the possibility of the obstetrician dropping the infant as the infant is moved away from the mother. Moreover, with the increased risk of blood borne infections from viral agents such as HIV, hepatitis and other diseases such as AIDS, it would be highly desirable to have a new and improved cutting apparatus and method that eliminates or at least greatly reduces such risks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof there is illustrated a disposable medical knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which is constructed in accordance with the present invention. The knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is designed specifically for clamping and severing an umbilical cord with one simple motion with a consistent predetermined amount of hand pressure force of between about ten pounds of pressure and about twelve pounds of pressure which insures precise cutting as will be explained hereinafter in greater detail. The size of the disposable knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is specifically designed to fit any size of umbilical cord and to be easily held in one hand to affect a novel method of clamping and cutting in a single motion operation. More specifically this specification will describe a medical knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is designed to sever the umbilical cord by clamping the umbilical cord on both the fetal and the maternal side and simultaneously cutting the cord. The knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as will be explained hereinafter in greater details has two independent clamps that are spaced apart from one another and that separate after severing the cord. In this regard one clamp remains on fetal side of the umbilical cord and one clamp remains on the maternal side of the umbilical cord there by trapping blood in each segment. This technique results in a reduced loss of blood during the cutting process. Moreover cord blood entrapped in both segments of the cord can be harvested for further diagnostic procedures. The knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also employs a plurality of shear pins that requires the user to apply a specific amount of force to server the cord thus creating a uniform cut. One of the clamps, and more specifically the maternal clamp has a quick release mechanism that enables the rapid harvesting of blood. The closely parallel dual clamps reduce the amount of blood entrapped at the point of severance of the cord that further reduces fluid loss and exposure. The knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is designed to be the correct size to enable the user to produce the cut using one hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Considering now the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> generally comprises an inner clamp blade assembly indicated generally at <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an outer clamp assembly indicated generally at <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> pivotally connects the inner clamp blade assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so they may be squeezed together with one hand to affect the novel method of clamping and cutting in a single motion operation. A stop shear pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed in the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> holds the distal ends of the inner clamp blade assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> a sufficient distance apart to define an umbilical cord receiving space indicated generally at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The umbilical cord receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is sufficiently large to receive any size umbilical cord. As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail, when the stop shear pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is severed, the inner clamp blade assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are free to pivot together in a locking configuration for umbilical cord clamping and simultaneous cutting purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the inner clamp blade assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes a lockable slideable blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having a cutting blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a no-skid concave finger grip or saddle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The finger grip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enable a user of the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to comfortably and easily grip the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in one hand with the fingers of the user resting on the saddle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the thumb of the user extending across the under surface of the outer clamping assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The finger grip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also functions as a stop to limit the travel of the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as it slides from within the inner blade clamp assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and into a blade receiving space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that is disposed within the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As will be explained hereinafter in greater detail a pair of shear pins that includes an inner shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an outer shear pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> not only help secure together the component parts of the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> respectively, but also function to insure a clean severance of the cord with a blade shearing force of between about ten pounds of pressure and about twelve pounds of pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes a pair of inner clamping members and more specifically an inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The inner clamping members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> each has a generally plano-concave structure at about their respective distal end portions with serrated gripping surfaces indicated generally at <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> respectively. The serrated gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> help grip and secure an umbilical cord as it is clamped between the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> includes a pair of outer clamping members and more specifically an outer neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an outer maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The outer clamping members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are generally plano-concave in structure at about their respective distal end portions and have serrated gripping surfaces generally indicated at <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> respectively for cooperating with the gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the inner clamping members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to insure that an umbilical cord clamped between the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is tightly gripped for an immediate cutting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Considering now the method of using the medical knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for clamping and severing an umbilical cord, a user (not shown) grasp the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between the thumb and the remaining fingers of the hand of the user. In this regard, the fingers are disposed on the finger saddle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the inner blade clamp assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the thumb disposed on the under surface of the outer clamp assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The user next, moves the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into contact with the umbilical cord so that the umbilical cord is received within the umbilical cord receiving space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. With the umbilical cord disposed within the space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the user squeezes the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a sufficient amount of pressure to break the stop shear pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> thereby allowing the distal end portions of the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to firmly clamp the umbilical cord. In this regard, as the user continues to squeeze the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the relative pressure exerted on the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> causes the blade shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to break under a pressure of between about ten pounds and about twelve pounds of pressure. Upon the breaking of the blade shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> slides out from the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and into the blade receiving space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> passes through and severs the umbilical cord. The travel of the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is halted in a locked position when the undersurface of the finger saddle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the top portions of the inner clamping members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively. In this locked position, the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> remains attached to the inner clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer clamping member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which pair of inner and outer clamping members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> now define a neonatal clamp arrangement indicated generally at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The remaining components of the medical knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, including the inner clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the outer clamping member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> define a maternal clamp arrangement indicated generally at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art, that once the shear pins <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have been broken, the two independent clamp arrangements <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are separated from one another allowing the infant segment of the umbilical cord to be moved toward the infant and the maternal segment of the umbilical cord to be moved toward the mother. In this regard, should the user desire to harvest a blood sample from the maternal clamp side of the umbilical cord, the user can depress a quick release button <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> forming part of the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> causing the pair of inner and outer clamp members on the maternal side of the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to separate and thus temporarily releasing the umbilical cord on the maternal side for rapid blood harvesting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Considering now the disposable knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> generally comprises the pair of independent clamp arrangements that includes the neonatal clamp arrangement indicated generally at <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the maternal clamp arrangement indicated generally at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The neonatal clamp arrangement <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as noted before, includes the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, pivotally connects the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the outer neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In a similar manner, the maternal clamp arrangement <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the outer maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> also pivotally connects the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the outer maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Considering now the pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> generally includes a pair of pin caps, which includes a right side pin cap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a left side pin cap <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The right side pin cap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the left side pin cap <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are each dimensioned to fit within a pivot pin aperture, such as the pivot pin aperture <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, that is disposed at about the proximate end portion each of the various components of the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which includes the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the inner neonatal clamping segment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the outer neonatal clamping segment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the inner maternal clamping segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the outer maternal clamping segment <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the right side pin cap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is further dimensioned to hold in an assembled condition the neonatal clamping arrangement <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which when separated from the maternal clamping arrangement <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, has the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> attached thereto. In a similar manner the cap pin <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to hold in an assembled condition the maternal clamping arrangement <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. From the foregoing, it should be understood by those skilled in the art, that once the shear pins <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have been severed, the neonatal clamping arrangement <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the maternal clamping arrangement <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from one another allowing the clamped segments of the infant side of the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be moved with the infant and the clamped segments of the maternal side of the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be moved with the mother. This is an important feature of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lockable blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is held in place between them by the pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the blade shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes through a blade aperture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> disposed in the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, locking the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in place between the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An inner neonatal clamping aperture <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an inner maternal clamping aperture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to receive in a friction tight fit, the shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sufficiently long to extend through the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cooperates with a pivot pin cap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> forming part of the pivot pin assembly <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, to hold the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> firmly between the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will be held securely between the inner members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> until a sufficient amount of pressure force is applied to the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to allow it to shear the shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a pressure force of between about 10 pounds of pressure and about 12 pounds of pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate locking the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> between the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, as well as the clamping members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> each include a locking arrangement indicated generally at <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As each of the locking arrangements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are substantially similar only a single locking arrangement <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will be described hereinafter in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The locking arrangement <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> generally includes a pair of spaced apart circular splines, such as a spline <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The spline <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a series of uniformly spaced ridges and valleys that are dimensioned so that the ridges and valleys interlock with a like set of spaced apart ridges and valleys that are disposed on the opposing face portion of the spline <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Due to the interlocking arrangement between the ridges and valleys of the splines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the components carrying the respective splines interlock and pivotally rotate together as the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is moved into the blade receiving space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Considering now the blade shear pins <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as the stop pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each of the pins <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are composed of an inert plastic material that breaks under a shear force of between about ten pounds of pressure and about twelve pounds of pressure. The exertion of this force occurs when the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is moved pivotally in unison with the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a sufficient distance to break the stop shear pin <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> thereby allowing the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to come together in a clamping like manner. As the inner assembly <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the outer assembly <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> come towards one another to clamp the umbilical cord disposed within the umbilical cord space <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, further pressure on the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> causes the blade shear pin <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to snap allowing the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to pass through the umbilical cord. The blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> continues its travel into the blade receiving space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> where the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> breaks or shears the other blade shear pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The motion of blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is halted when the underside of the finger grip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> engages the tops of the inner neonatal clamping member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner maternal clamping member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Considering now the blade assembly <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in greater detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the blade assembly generally includes the blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the finger grip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a circular base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. On each face portion of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> there is disposed a spline, such as the spline <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the spline <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the forms part of the locking arrangement <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as noted before. A pivot pin aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at the geometric center of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The splines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are spaced from the geometric center of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a radial arrangement that terminates at outer periphery of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is integrally connected to an outer segment portion of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and extends outwardly therefrom in a parallel plane forming a wall like structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The base or bottom portion of the wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed into a sharp triangularly shaped cutting edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that extends the entire length of the wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> terminating at the outer periphery of the base member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the length of the wall is chosen to be sufficient long to be able to cut any size umbilical cord in a clean precise manner. The wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a thickness dimension that enables the blade wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to easily slide between the two inner clamping components <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when assembled. As will be explained hereinafter, a front edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the wall is in a smooth plano-convex configuration that corresponds in its radial dimension to a front wall portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the inner clamping components <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively. In this manner, the front walls of the inner clamping components as well as the front edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the blade wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> present smooth non cutting surfaces allowing the knife assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to be easily handled without the danger of cutting the user, mother or infant in an accidental manner. </paragraph>
