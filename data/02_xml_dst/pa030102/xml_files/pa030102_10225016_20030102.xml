<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a process for treating a liquid. It also relates to a process for recovering citric acid. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for treating a liquid, which process comprises: (a) subjecting a liquid containing solution, citric acid as well as a less desirable component having a similar molecular weight to citric acid, to nanofiltration in a filtration step; and (b) obtaining, from the filtration step, a permeate in which the ratio of the concentration of the citric acid to that of the less desirable component is greater than the ratio of the concentration of the citric acid to that of the less desirable component in the solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In other words, there is a greater degree of rejection of the less desirable component than of the citric acid in the filtration step. The nanofiltration will normally involve contacting the liquid with a nanofiltration membrane. Nanofiltration will naturally also separate the citric acid from any component with a molecular weight which is significantly greater than that of citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The molecular weight or relative molecular mass of the less desirable component may be within 20% of that of citric acid. For example, the molecular weight of the less desirable component may be within 10%, and even within about 7%, of that of citric acid. In other words, the molecular weight of the second component may range from 0.8MW-1.2MW, e.g., 0.9MW-1.1MW, or even about 0.93MW&mdash;about 1.07MW, where MW is the molecular weight of the citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Applicant believes that the process will have particular, but not necessarily exclusive, application in the treatment of fermentation broth to separate citric acid present therein as a fermentation product from residual glucose and/or fructose, thereby recovering the citric acid. It has been found that, with the process of the invention, the citric acid can be separated from residual glucose and/or fructose as well as other impurities such as medium and higher molecular weight by-products such as peptide and polysaccharides, produced by fermentation microorganisms, and which can be undesirable. In other words, the process has specific application in the recovery of citric acid from a fermentation broth, particularly from a clarified citric acid fermentation broth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The clarified citric acid fermentation broth can typically be that obtained by fermenting a carbohydrate feedstock to produce citric acid-rich fermentation broth and waste solids, and separating the broth from the solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Citric acid has a similar molecular mass to glucose and fructose and can preferentially be separated from glucose and/or fructose in the process according to the invention, as a result of its greater permeability through the nanofiltration membrane as compared to that of glucose and/or fructose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The filtration step may be carried out at a concentration of the citric acid in the broth of 5%-30% by mass, preferably 10%-20% by mass, and the nanofiltration may be carried out at a temperature of 10&deg; C.-100&deg; C., preferably 20&deg; C.-50&deg; C. The pressure drop across the nanofiltration membrane will depend on the nature of the membrane and one the nature of the citric acid and the less desirable component to be separated and can be established by routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The clarified citric acid fermentation broth may, before the filtration step, be subjected to cation exchange to remove cations, such as potassium and magnesium ions, therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The process may include further treating the citric acid solution from the filtration step to purify it and/or to obtain a more concentrated citric acid fraction, or solid citric acid or a derivative of citric acid, such as sodium citrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, the citric acid solution from the filtration step may be purified by anion exchange, e.g., to remove traces of anionic impurities, and/or by contacting it with activated carbon to remove traces of organic matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The purified citric acid solution may then be concentrated. This may include treating the solution to obtain solid pure citric acid and residual mother liquor. The concentration may include subjecting the solution to at least one evaporation and crystallization sequence. In particular, the concentration may include passing the solution sequentially through an evaporator; a first crystallizer; a first centrifuge; optionally a dissolution tank, a second crystallizer and a second centrifuge; and producing mother liquor in the first centrifuge and, when present, in the second centrifuge. A portion of the mother liquor from the second centrifuge, when present, may then be recycled to the first crystallizer, while the mother liquor from the fist centrifuge is withdrawn. The contacting of the citric acid solution with the activated carbon hereinbefore referred to may instead, or additionally, be effected after the purified citric acid solution has been concentrated at least partially, e.g., after it has passed through the evaporator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The process may also include: (i) recycling a portion of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge to upstream of the evaporator; and/or (ii) withdrawing at least a portion of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge as a liquid product; and/or (iii) drying and/or granulating at least a portion of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge to obtain a solid citric acid/carbohydrate product; and/or (iv) treating at least a portion of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge, in a recovery step, to recover citric acid for recycle, or citrate salts as product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the process includes treating at least a portion of the mother liquid from the first centrifuge in a recovery step to recover citric acid, this citric acid may be recycled to upstream and/or downstream of the nanofiltration step. The treatment in the recovery step may then comprise one of the following: calcium citrate precipitation by adding lime thereto and redissolving with sulphuric acid; solvent extraction of citric acid utilizing a suitable solvent, followed by re-extraction of citric acid from the solvent into water using concentration differences or heating; ion exchange using a resin which selectively adsorbs citric acid, followed by elution; or various types of chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At least a portion of the retentate from the filtration step may be withdrawn as a liquid product. Instead, or additionally, at least a portion of the retentate from the filtration step may be dried or granulated to obtain a solid citric acid product. Instead, or additionally, at least a portion of the retentate from the filtration step may be treated in a citric acid recovery step, which may then be the same as the citric acid recovery step, hereinbefore described, to recover citric acid or a derivative thereof therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The retentate from the filtration step may be combined with the mother liquor from the first centrifuge for withdrawal as a liquid product and/or for drying or granulating and/or for treatment in a recovery step, as hereinbefore described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for recovering citric acid, which process comprises subjecting a clarified citric acid fermentation broth to nanofiltration in a filtration step to obtain as a permeate, a purified citric acid solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The clarified citric acid fermentation broth may, before the filtration step, be subjected to cation exchange as hereinbefore described. The citric acid solution from the filtration step may be treated further to purify it and/or to obtain a more concentrated citric acid fraction, or solid citric acid or a derivative of citric acid, as hereinbefore described. The filtration step may also be as hereinbefore described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying simplified flow diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of a process according to the invention for treating a fermentation broth, and with reference to the non-limiting examples.</paragraph>

A solid product withdrawal line <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> leads from the screening stage <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The second crystallization stage <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and second centrifugation stage <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are used to improve crystal quality and are optional; they can be dispensed with, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A mother liquor withdrawal line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> leads from the first centrifugation stage <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of the invention, the line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be routed back to the flow line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for recycling a portion of the mother liquor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the invention, the flow line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> call lead to a suitable liquid product withdrawal stage <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a third embodiment of The invention, the flow line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can lead to a drying and granulation stage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a fourth embodiment of the invention, the flow line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can lead to a recovery stage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A waste product withdrawal line <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> leads from the stage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A citric acid recycle line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> leads from the stage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> back to upstream and/or downstream of stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the first, second, third and fourth embodiments described hereinbefore are optional and can be used individually, or a combination of two or more of the embodiments can be used, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A flow line <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can, if desired, lead from the flow line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the flow line <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> upstream of the product withdrawal stage <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the drying and granulation stage <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and/or the citric acid recovery unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In use, clarified citric acid fermentation broth, produced in known fashion in the fermentation stage, passes to the cation exchanger <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> where it is contacted with a suitable resin to remove cations such as calcium and sodium ions. If these ions are not removed they would form complexes with the citrate ions and be retained by the nanofilter element in the subsequent filtration stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> leading to product losses. The resin bed can be regenerated in known fashion, when required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The broth then passes to the nanofiltration stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> where the citric acid is separated, by contacting the broth with a nanofiltration membrane, from glucose, fructose, and higher molcular weight components in the broth such as protein, residual anti-foaming agents, sucrose, peptides and polysaccharides which thus form the retentate. Smaller molecules as well as some anions pass through the nanofiltration membrane and, together with the citric acid and most of the water, form the permeate. The permeate is thus in the form of a purified citric acid solution in which the ratio or proportion of the concentration of citric acid to that of glucose and fructose is greater than the ratio or proportion or the concentration of citric acid to that of the glucose and fructose in the feed to the stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the filtration stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, glucose and fructose, which have a similar molecular weight (<highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>) to citric acid (<highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>) are separated therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The permeate from the filtration stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> passes to the anionic exchanger <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> where anionic impurities are removed and withdrawn. The resin bed of the anionic exchanger <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is regenerated in known fashion, when required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The citric acid containing solution from the exchanger <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> passes to the activated carbon bed stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> where traces of organics are removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The citric acid solution thereafter passes to the evaporator where it is concentrated, using steam, from a concentration of 10% to 20% by mass citric acid, typically up to about 65% to 80% by mass citric acid. Condensate from the evaporation stage <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> leaves along the line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The concentrated citric acid solution passes to the first crystallization stage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> where crystallization of the citric acid is effected. The stream then passes to the first centrifuge stage <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> where the citric acid crystals are separated from the mother liquor. The citric acid crystals pass into the dissolution tank <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> where they are redissolved in make-up water, whereafter they are recrystallized in the second crystallization stage <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to improve crystal quality. The make-up water may be obtained from any suitable source, such as process condensate, a dilute citric acid stream, or the like.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The process <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention was simulated theoretically as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Clarified citric acid fermentation broth containing 18.4 weight percent citric acid, can be obtained by fermentating various cultures, such as <highlight><italic>Aspergillus niger</italic></highlight>, on a purified carbohydrate feedstock, and filtering off the resultant biomass. The broth leaving the fermenters can contain 0.2% (w/w) unfermented glucose or 0.2% (w/w) unfermented fructose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The clarified citric acid fermentation broth is then subjected to cation exchange, to remove cations such as potassium and magnesium ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The clarified decationized citric acid fermentation broth is then contacted with a nanofiltration membrane, and 80 or more percent of the citric acid transfers to the permeate, which contains up to 18 weight percent citric acid. The permeate also contains the following from the clarified decationized citric acid fermentation broth: a portion of the glucose and fructose, anions, cations, amino acids and sucrose, as well as 80 or more percent of the water. The retentate can be treated in a citric acid recovery step, using the UOP&trade; Citric Acid Sorbex&trade; Process (Citrex&trade;), to recover the remaining citric acid, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The permeate from the nanofiltration step can be subjected to anion exchange, to remove traces of anionic impurities, followed by contacting with activated carbon, to remove traces of organics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The permeate can thereafter be concentrated by evaporation in an evaporator, followed by a first crystallizer, a first centrifuge, a dissolution tank, a second crystallizer and a second centrifuge; with 20% by weight of the mother liquor from the second centrifuge being recycled to the first crystallizer, while the mother liquor from the first centrifuge is withdrawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The process can include (i) recycling 25% (w/w) of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge to upstream of the evaporator, (ii) withdrawing 10.0% (w/w) of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge as a liquid product, (iii) drying and granulating 21.6% (w/w) of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge to obtain a solid citric acid/carbohydrate product; and (iv) treating the remainder of the mother liquor from the first centrifuge, together with 80% (w/w) of the nanofiltration retentate, using the UOP&trade; Citric Acid Sorbex&trade; Process (Citrex&trade;) process (this process revolves around any one of various chromatographic techniques, such as ion exclusion chromatography, whereby citric acid is separated from the feed stream by selective adsorption onto a solid adsorbent) in a recovery step, to recover citric acid which can be recycled to downstream of the nanofiltration step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the Citrex recovery step, which uses a very dilute solution of sulfuric acid as desorbent, the extract can contain, from the feed stream, on a weight to weight basis: 92% of the citric acid, 1% of the glucose and fructose, 1% of the cations and anions, 1% of the amino acids and biomass, negligible sulfuric acid, and 44% of the water from both the feed stream and the desorbent stream. The balance of the above mentioned components report to the raffinate (waste stream). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a simulation of the nanofiltration step or stage <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, laboratory scale tests were conducted on simulated citric acid fermentation broths coding, by mass, 18-19% citric acid, 1% lactose, 0.2% glucose and 0.05% yeast extract. The yeast extract was used to mimic other components normally present in commercial formation broths. Each test was conducted with a pair of membranes, by treating a batch of the simulated broth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Concentrations of each of the components were measured, and the rejections calculated. The results are set out in Tables 1. 2 and 3 (all percentages are on a mass bases).

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> One of the key parameters in nanofiltration is the rejection. For the simulated citric acid fermentation broths, it was expected, according to literature and product information, that membrane rejections would be in the order lactose&gt;citric acid&gt;glucose, However, as can be seen from Table 3, the actual rejection of citric acid was surprisingly found to be lower than that of glucose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This feature thus provides the basis for a simple and efficient means of separating citric acid from high and medium molecular weight impurities as well as removing most of the residual glucose, in respect of fermentation broth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that, together with the citric acid, other more valuable fermentation products can be separated from the glucose. </paragraph>
