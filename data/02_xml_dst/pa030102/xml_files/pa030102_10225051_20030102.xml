<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a recording medium on which a plurality of programs are collected in a plurality of groups and supervised in this grouped state, and an editing method and apparatus for editing, such as dividing/linking/erasing the predetermined programs or groups, recorded on the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An optical disc can be larger in recording capacity than a magnetic disc by two to three order of magnitudes and can be accessed at a higher speed than a tape-shaped recording medium. In addition, the optical disc has merits such as non-contact recording and/or reproduction for a medium and high durability and, for this reason, has recently come to be used extensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Among known optical discs, there are, for example, a replay-only optical disc, conforming, as a standard, to the CD-DA (Digital Audio) format, for a standard CD (Compact Disc) having a replay-only area having data recorded in the form of pits, a magneto-optical disc, formed by a magneto-optical recording medium, conforming, as a standard, to the CD-MO (Magneto-Optical) format, as an extension format of the CD-DA format, having a recording and/or reproducing area, and a hybrid disc, including both a replay-only area, having data recorded thereon as pits, and a recording and/or reproducing area for data recording and/or reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, in a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus for recording data on a disc-shaped recording medium, such as a magneto-optical disc or a hybrid disc, recording is halted by a manual operation whenever the recording data has become useless data in the course of recording. For example, in recording a music air from a compact disc to a magneto-optical disc, recording by a magneto-optical disc recorder is halted by a manual operation after the end of the reproduction by a CD player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in a disc-shaped recording medium, such as an optical disc or a magneto-optical disc, there are provided a main data recording area for recording the main data, and a management data area for recording the management data, and the main data recording area is supervised as to a recorded area and a recordable area by management data recorded in the management data area. For example, the optical disc conforming to the CD format includes a data area, having program data, such as performance data, recorded thereon, and a lead-in area provided on its inner rim side. As the table-of-contents (TOC) data, showing the sites of recording and recording contents of the data area, the recorded start address information and the recording end address information for the entire program data are recorded in order in the lead-in area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present Assignee has already proposed an MD system for digitally recording and/or reproducing e.g., music signals, using a Mini-Disc (MD, a registered trademark) comprised of an optical disc 64 mm in diameter accommodated in a cartridge. There are three sorts of the Mini-Disc, namely a replay-only optical disc, a recordable optical disc and a hybrid disc comprised of a replay-only area and a recordable area. In an MD system capable of recording main data, a program area and UTOC (User TOC) area are provided in the recordable area of the Mini-Disc and the table of contents data indicating the recording positions and contents of the program arera are recorded in the UTOC area. That is, in the case of the Mini-Disc system, there is recorded the management data, termed UTOC, apart from the main data, such as music data, for supervising the recorded data area, in which the user has made recording on the disc, and a non-recorded area, that is a recordable area. The recording apparatus discriminates an area in which to make recording, as it references this UTOC, whilst the reproducing apparatus discriminates an area to be reproduced as it references the UTOC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> That is, programs etc as each music air recorded are managed in the UTOC in terms of tracks as data units, and the start and end addresses thereof are recorded therein. In a free area in the UTOC, where no recording has been made, there are recorded start and end addresses, as an area in which to record data as from the current time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the Mini-Disc system, a disc name, capable of indicating e.g., the disc title as a part of the editing function, and a track name, capable of indicating the title of e.g., a program, recorded in terms of a track or a program as a unit, can be input and registered by a user in accordance with a predetermined operating method. In the Mini-Disc system, the letter information registered as the disc or track name, is stored in a predetermined area on the UTOC, such that, in e.g., reproduction, the letter information stored can be displayed and output by referencing the disc name and the track name of the desired track stored in the UTOC. In the following, the disc name and the track name are collectively referenced as a &ldquo;name&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> By exploiting these functions, the user may register disc or track names and subsequently confirm the registration as the name of the disc loaded in the reproducing apparatus or the name of the track-based music air is demonstrated on a display unit. Meanwhile, in the Mini-Disc system, recording up to the maximum of 80 minutes (160 minutes for monaural recording) is possible by data compression employing the ATRAC (acoustic transferred adapted coding system). Even the recording of the maximum 320 minutes in a LP4 (long playing) mode by employing the ATRAC3 compression system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the conventional Mini-Disc system, there is only a concept of managing the entire disc and the music airs, as a recorded management method, so that, if an album of three CDs is recorded in accordance with ATRAC 3, it has not been possible to perform album-based management. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applied to an MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown for example in the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is capable of recording and/or reproducing speech data on or from a magneto-optical disc (MD; Mini-Disc, a registered trademark) <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, housed in a cartridge, is configured for being irradiated with the light from an optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as an optical pickup or applying a magnetic field from a magnetic head by opening/closing a shutter mechanism provided in the cartridge in recording and/or reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is run in rotation at a CLV (constant linear velocity) by a spindle motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a disc detection unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided for detecting the loading/unloading state of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> with respect to the loading position of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is sufficient if the disc detection unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is able to detect the possible loading of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> There is no particular limitation to the specified structure of the disc detection unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, the disc detection unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a mechanical switch thrust or opened by the cartridge of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is in the loaded state, or may be a photo-interrupter that is able to detect the possible presence of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to detect the possible loading of the disc based on a signal derived from the reflection of the laser light radiated from the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as now explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted in a facing relation to a magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the loaded magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in-between. The optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made up of an objective lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a bi-axial mechanism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor laser, not shown, and a light reception unit for receiving the light radiated by the semiconductor laser and reflected by the magneto-optical disc surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The bi-axial mechanism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a focusing coil for driving the objective lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a direction towards and away from the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and a tracking coil for driving the objective lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>radially of the magneto-optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> There is also provided a sled mechanism <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for causing marked movement of the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in its entirety along the radial direction of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The reflected light information, detected by the light receiving section in the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is sent to an RF amplifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Following current/voltage conversion, the matrix processing is executed to generate focusing error signals FE and tracking error signals TE as well as RF signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the light is illuminated on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a laser power lower than that in recording, the magnetic field vector is detected by exploiting the magnetic Kerr effect of the reflected light to generate the RF signals, as replay signals, based on the detected magnetic field vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The focusing error signals FE and the tracking error signals Te, generated by the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, are processed by a servo circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with phase adjustment or gain adjustment, and subsequently applied to the focusing coil and to the tracking coil of the bi-axial mechanism <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via a driving amplifier, not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> From the tracking error signals TE, sled error signals are generated in the sled mechanism <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the servo circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> so as to be applied via a sled drive amplifier to the sled mechanism <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The RF signals, generated by the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, are binary-coded by an EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and demodulated for EFM (eight-to-fourteen modulation) while being corrected for errors with CIRC (cross-interleave read-Solomon coding) so as to be supplied to a memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> On the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are formed grooves with a meandering at a predetermined frequency to record address data by frequency modulation. The predetermined meandering frequency of the grooves is 22.05 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> These address data may be extracted by frequency demodulation via a band-pass filter in an address decoder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adapted for passing only the predetermined frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> generates binary-coded EFM signals or spindle error signals for rotationally controlling the disc based on an address decoder, as extracted from the address decoder, to apply the so-generated spindle error signals through the servo circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the spindle motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> controls the pull-in operation of the phase-locked loop, based on the binary-coded EFM signals, to generate spindle error signals for rotationally controlling the disc to apply the so-generated spindle error signals on the spindle motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The error-corrected binary-coded data is written by the memory controlling <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When more than a predetermined amount of data stored in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reads out data from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a transfer rate sufficiently slower than the write transfer rate and outputs data as audio data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The data is stored first in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and subsequently output as audio data, so that, if unnecessary track jumps occur against disturbances, such as vibrations, such that continuous data read-out from the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is interrupted, data corresponding to the data for the time necessary for re-arrangement of the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to an address where the track jump has occurred is pre-stored in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thus realizing the continuous audio signal outputting without sound interruptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, if a 4-Mbyte RAM is used as the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, audio data continuing for about 10 seconds can be stored in the state of the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> fully charged with data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the operation of the memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by a system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The data read-out from the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has been compressed in recording in accordance with a predetermined compression method, herein the ATRAC (Acoustic Transferred Adapted Coding) system. The data read out from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> under control by the memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is decompressed by an audio compression encoder&mdash;expansion decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into decompressed digital data which then is applied to a D/A converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The D/A converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> converts the digital data, decompressed by the audio compression encoder&mdash;expansion decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, into analog audio signals, which are sent at an output terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a replay output system, such as amplifier, loudspeaker and a headphone, not shown, so as to be output as replay audio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the above-described replay operation, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is responsive to the operation by an operating unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to transfer various servo commands to the servo circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, command the memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to control the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, perform control to cause a display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, display the letter information, such as the play time elapsed or the title of the program being reproduced, or to perform control such as spindle servo or decoding processing control in the EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> There is also provided a remote commander <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for outputting commands responsive to the user operations as e.g., the IR modulation signals. This command, that is the operating information, is converted by an IR receiving unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> into electrical signals, which are routed to the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The system controller then performs necessary control processing responsive to the operational information from the IR receiving unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> If, in this MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, audio data, such as music air, is to be recorded on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the audio signals are supplied to an input terminal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The analog audio signals, output from an analog output terminal of the reproducing apparatus, such as a CD player, are input to the input terminal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and converted by an A/D converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into digital signals, which are sent to the audio compression encoder&mdash;expansion decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The digital audio signals, input to the audio compression encoder&mdash;expansion decoder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are compression-coded in accordance with the ATRAC (Acoustic Transferred Adapted Coding) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> system. The compressed digital audio signals are temporarily stored via memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> detects that a predetermined amount of the compressed data have been stored in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and permits the data to be read out from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The compressed data read out from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are processed by the EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with e.g., error code appendage or EFM and thence supplied to a magnetic head driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The magnetic head driving circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is responsive to the data supplied thereto to apply a magnetic field of N or S poles of the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In recording for applying the magnetic field in this manner, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> controls the radiating power of the semiconductor laser, not shown, of the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to heat the magneto-optical disc surface up to the Curie temperature. This attaches the magnetic field information applied from the magnetic head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the disc recording surface to record data as the magnetic field information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In recording, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transfers various servo commands to the servo circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, issues control commands to the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the memory controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, performs control to cause the display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to demonstrate e.g., the track number of the program being recorded or the elapsed recording time, or performs encoding or servo control in the EFM/CIRC encoder/decoder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> This MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is able to record music air or track as program as audio data, the letter information, such as letter information for the entire disc, such as the letter information, e.g., the track name or disc name, in addition to the audio data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In order for the user to input the letter information by way of name registration, the operating unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes a letter selection unit, such as an operating dial, and a decision key for determining the input letter string to terminate the letter inputting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The remote commander <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is provided with alphabet keys from A to Z, space key -, symbol keys such as &quest; or // and ten keys for inputting numerical figures, in order to enable letter inputting with the aid of the remote commander <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The remote commander <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is also provided with a decision key for determining the input letter string, using these keys, or to terminate the letter inputting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> holds letters input from the operating unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the remote commander <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> on the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the letter string is determined by the decision operation, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> registers the letter string in a state matched to the program selected for the time being. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The program selected for the time being is the program being then reproduced, recorded or paused. If such state is not prevalent, with the program not being selected, the input letter string is handled as being the letter information for the entire disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The letter information registered is written on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> as data of the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as later explained, so as to be finalized on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The UTOC data is updated at a predetermined timing following the recording operation or the letter inputting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> However, in recording and/or reproducing the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to read out the management data recorded on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, that is, the PTOC (pre-mastered TOC) or the UTOC (user TOC). The system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> then discriminates an address for an area for recording or and an address of an area to be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> This management data is held in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. To this end, the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is partitioned into a buffer area used as a data area for recording and/or reproducing data and a TOC area for holding the management data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reads out the management data by the operation of reproducing the innermost rim of the disc carrying the recorded management data on loading the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to store the read-out information in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to be referenced in the course of the recording/reproducing/editing of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the UTOC is rewritten for data recording or a variety of editing operations. In each recording/editing operation, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> performs UTOC updating processing on the UTOC information stored in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, responsive to the rewriting operation, rewrites the UTOC area of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a predetermined timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> That is, when the user has input the letter information for name registration, the input letter information as the disc name or the track name is held on the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the letter input has become finalized, the management data in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is updated by exploiting the letter information in the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This management data is written at a predetermined timing in the UTOC area of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to update the UTOC contents of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, since the letter information as the name is obtained by the editing operation performed by the user, as the letter inputting operation for name registration, it may be said to be the editing information in the management data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present embodiment, in which the TOC letter information area is set in the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> based on the above structure, name letter inputting and editing may be carried out not only on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> loaded on the MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> but also on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> not loaded on the MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as will be explained subsequently in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A cluster format of the recording data track on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is now explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The recording operation in the Mini-Disc system is performed in terms of a cluster as unit. The format for the cluster is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As the recording track in the Mini-Disc system, plural clusters CL are formed contiguously, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, with one cluster being the minimum recording unit. Each cluster corresponds to two to three cycles of tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, each cluster CL is made up of a sub-data area of four sectors SFC to SFF and the main data area of 32 sectors S<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F. In audio data, the main data is audio data compressed by ATRAC processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> One sector is a data unit made up of 2352 bytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The 4-sector sub-data area is used for sub-data or as a linking area, while the 32-sector main data area is used for recording TOC and audio data. The sectors of the linking area are throw-out sectors for matching the longer interleaving length, used herein, of the CIRC to the sector length of 13.3 msec as used for error correction in e.g., a CD, and basically represent a reserve area. However, these sectors may also be used for some processing or other or for recording some control data or other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, addresses are recorded on the sector basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Each sector is subdivided into sound groups, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, while two sectors are subdivided into 11 sound groups, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, the sound groups SG<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> to SG<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>A are comprised in two consecutive sectors, made up of an even sector, such as sector S<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight>, and an odd sector, such as sector S<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>. Each sound group is made up of 424 bytes, and corresponds to the sound data volume corresponding to 11.61 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, data are recorded in L and R channels within one sound group SG, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference>. For example, the sound group SG<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> is made up of L-channel data L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and R-channel data R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, whilst the sound group SG<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> is made up of L-channel data L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R-channel data R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, 212 bytes which become the data area of the L- R channel are called a sound frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The cluster format, explained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, is formed in the entire area of the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which is divided in the radial direction into a radially inner area as a management area and into a program area contiguous to the management area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the radially inner disc area, there is provided a replay-only area in which replay-only data are recorded in the form of phase pits. Next to the replay-only area, there is recorded the photo-magnetically recordable and/or reproducible area. The management area is provided on the innermost areas of the replay-only area and the photomagnetic area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the program area, formed consecutively to the management area of the photomagnetic area, audio data are recorded in each sector of the main data area of the program area shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As the management area, a PTOC (pre-mastered TOC) for area management of the entire disc is provided in the replay-only area. In the management area in the photomagnetic area contiguous to the replay-only area, there is recorded the UTOC (user table-of-contents) information used for supervising the respective programs as audio data of e.g., music airs recorded in the program area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A UTOC sector, as the management data for supervising the recording and/or reproducing operation of a track corresponding to the program of e.g., the music airs in the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, is now explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the format of for UTOC sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As the UTOC sectors, sectors from sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> up to sector <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be provided. That is, each of the sectors S<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F of one cluster in the management area may be used. The sectors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are the areas for the letter information, whilst the sector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an area for recording the recording date and time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The UTOC sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is mainly the data management area where there is recorded the management data on the free area in which the user has made recording and in which a program can be newly recorded. That is, in the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, a start address as a start point or an end address as an end point of each program recorded in the program area, the copying protection information as a track mode representing the properties of each program, and the emphasis information, are supervised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> For example, if a music air is to be recorded on the disc <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> finds out the free area on the disc, from the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, to record the audio data therein. In replay, the area in which the music air to be reproduced has been recorded is discriminated from the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and is accessed for reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there are recorded in the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, in continuation to the header portion forming a sync pattern with 12 bytes, &ldquo;cluster H&rdquo;, &ldquo;cluster L&rdquo; and &ldquo;sector&rdquo;, as three byte data representing the address of the sector, a maker code &ldquo;maker code&rdquo; representing the disc producer, a model code &ldquo;model code&rdquo;, a first program number &ldquo;first TNO&rdquo;, the last program number &ldquo;last TNO&rdquo;, the sector using state, the disc serial number &ldquo;disc serial No.&rdquo; and the disc ID, by way of an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> There are also recorded a pointer P-DFA (pointer for defective area) indicating the leading position of the slot in which to store the defect position produced on the disc, the pointer-EMPTY (pointer for EMPTY slot), indicating the slot using state, pointer P-ERA (pointer for free area), indicating the leading position of the slot supervising the recordable area and accommodating table indicating data made up of pointer P-TNO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P-TNO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , P-TNO<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> indicating the leading position of the slot associated with the respective program numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Next, a management table having <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> of 8-byte slots is provided. In each slot, the start address, end address, track mode and the link information are supervised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the present magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, it is unnecessary to record the data consecutively but sequential data strings may be recorded discretely, that is as plural parts, on the recording medium. Meanwhile, the parts denote temporally consecutive data recorded in physically consecutive clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> That is, the reproducing apparatus, adapted for coping with the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, is designed so that the data are transiently recorded in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and so that the write rate and the readout rate to or from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are varied, in a manner as described above. Thus, the optical head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be caused to sequentially access data discretely recorded on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to memorize the data in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to restore the stored data into the sequential data string on the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> With this structure, continuous speech reproduction is not obstructed because the write rate is faster than the readout rate in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> during reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the program shorter than the recorded program is overwritten on the pre-recorded program, any redundant portion may be specified as a recordable area managed from the pointer P-FRA without being erased to utilize the recording capacity efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Using the case of the pointer P-FRA supervising the recordable area, the method for linking the discrete areas is explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, if a value such as 03h (hexa-decimal) is recorded in a pointer P-FRA indicating the leading position of the slot supervising the recordable area, the slot corresponding to this &ldquo;03h&rdquo; is accessed. That is, the data of the slot 03h in the management table is read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the start and end addresses, recorded in the slot 03h, indicate the beginning and end points of a part recorded on the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The link information recorded in the slot 03h indicates an address of the slot which is to come next. In this case, 18h is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the link information recorded in the slot 18h is traced to access the slot 2Bh shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> to grasp the starting and end points of a part of the disc as the start and end addresses recorded in the slot 2Bh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In similar manner, the link information is traced until appearance of data &ldquo;00h&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</cross-reference> to grasp the addresses of the entire parts managed from the pointer P-FRA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Thus, the slots are traced until the link information is 00h indicating null, with the slot indicated by the pointer P-FRA as a starting point, whereby the parts discretely recorded on the disc can be linked on the memory. In such case, the totality of parts as the recordable area on the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be grasped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the pointer P-FRA is taken as an example. In similar manner, the pointers P-DFA, P-EMPTY, P-TNO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P-TNO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , P-TNO<highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, may also be supervised by linking discrete parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the format of the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the disc title, for example, is managed as the letter information associated with respective programs recorded in the program area and as the letter information associated with the entire magneto-optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> If the program recorded is audio data, the disc title is the information such as the album title or the performer&apos;s name, while the letter information associated with each program is the information such as the name of the music air. For registering the letter information, the user optionally sets and inputs a letter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The letter information for each program is recorded in a slot in a letter table specified by a pointer P-TNA(x) of the accommodating table indicating data within a range from 1 to 255. Although the 7-byte letter information can be recorded in one slot, plural slots may be linked in recording, using the link information, if there are many letters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the recording time and date for each program, recorded in the program area, is managed in similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the UTOC sector <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, katakana and kanji are managed as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> so that these characters can be used as the fonts of the letter information, such as titles of the programs recorded in the program area or the title of the entire magneto-optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The illustrative structures of the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provided in the MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment are hereinafter explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, there are separately set in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a data area A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, where the recording data/replay data are stored, and a TOC area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where the management data on the recording data/replay data are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As aforesaid, the TOC area A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is an area in which PTOC and UTOC as management data read out from the magneto-optical disc <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, loaded on the MD recorder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is stored, and in which the management data is sequentially updated in accordance with the editing operations, such as recording operation or name registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the RAM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is split into three areas of a system controller control area A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a letter information control area A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a TOC letter information area A<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The system controller control area A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is an area in which the information such as program data used when the system controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> executes a variety of control processing operations or the results of calculations obtained by the control processing operations executed are sequentially stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The letter information control area A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is an area se as a working area used in case of performing an editing operation of creating or changing the name by the input letter information in accordance with the operation of inputting the letter information for name editing executed by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The TOC letter information area A<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is an area in which to store the letter information as the track or disc name as finalized by the processing for name registration. </paragraph>

If the result of decision at step S<highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> indicates null, that is if the disc name area is null, the contents of the buffer &lsqb;a or a-b; (album title)&rsqb; is registered in the disc name area (step S<highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>) to finish the registration processing in the disc name area. Thus, if the album title &ldquo;8-10; GA&rdquo; is input in the disc name area&equals;null, the contents shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are registered in the disc name area. </paragraph>
