<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An absorbent article for positioning in the crotch area of a garment of a wearer and against or closely adjacent to the body of the wearer for absorbing body fluids. The absorbent article includes a pair of outwardly extending side flaps that are adapted to be folded around the edges of the crotch panel of the garment, and to overlap each other for attachment together to aid in properly positioning and retaining the absorbent article on the wearer&apos;s garment. Attachment of the flaps is effected by a fastening system that permits attachment, release, and subsequent reattachment of the flaps to enable the absorbent article to be repositioned by the wearer. The fastening system also enables the article to be folded for convenient carrying and packaging before use, and to be refolded for convenient disposal of the article after use. Optionally, a line of weakness can be provided across at least one of the flaps to facilitate severance of the encircling flap assembly for ease of removal of the article from a panty after use, and extensibility zones can be formed in the flaps to permit lateral extension of the flaps to accommodate a wider crotch panel of the garment and also to accommodate stresses imposed on the flaps during application of the article to the garment and while it is in use. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a disposable absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin, that is intended to be worn by a user to absorb body waste fluids and that is adapted to be retained in a predetermined position on a garment that is worn by the user. More particularly, the present invention relates to a disposable absorbent article that includes side flaps that can pass around the crotch area of a garment to be releasably attached to each other and that can be detached and subsequently reattached to permit reorientation of the article relative to the garment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Disposable absorbent articles in the form of sanitary napkins having laterally outwardly extending side flaps for preventing absorbed body fluids from soiling the crotch area of an undergarment are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In that regard, U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478, entitled, &ldquo;Shaped Sanitary Napkin With Flaps.&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 18, 1987, to Van Tilburg, shows a sanitary napkin having side flaps that form a seal with the wearer&apos;s legs to protect the wearer&apos;s undergarment from being soiled by body fluids that are not absorbed by the napkin. The flaps each have two axes of flexibility, and each flap includes an outer adhesive area for connecting the flap with the outer surface of the wearer&apos;s undergarment at the crotch area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on May 20, 1986, to Van Tilburg, is directed to a sanitary napkin having side flaps for protecting the wearer&apos;s body and garments from being soiled by body fluids that are not absorbed by the napkin. The flaps include adhesive elements and also absorbent core members, and they are adapted to fold about a flexible fold axis to engage the outer surface of the wearer&apos;s undergarment at the crotch area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,047, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 26, 1986, to Mattingly, discloses a sanitary napkin that includes outwardly extending side flaps, one or both of which include an adhesive element for connecting the flaps together. The connection between the flaps is effected after the napkin has been positioned in the interior of the crotch area of an undergarment, by passing the flaps around the edges of the crotch area of the undergarment to meet on the outwardly-facing surface of the crotch area. Mattingly also discloses a folded sanitary napkin that utilizes the flaps to hold the folded napkin in a closed condition until it is desired to be used, and for refolding the napkin after use for disposal purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although the prior art napkins are generally suitable for performing their intended functions, it is desirable to provide an improved sanitary napkin that can be conveniently folded and packaged before use, that enables the napkin to be securely repositioned when in use and after it has at least once been positioned, and that is refoldable for convenient disposal after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved disposable absorbent article having laterally outwardly extending side flaps that are of a size sufficient to permit them to pass around the outside of the crotch area of an undergarment for attachment to each other, and that can thereafter be detached from each other and subsequently reattached again to remain reattached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a disposable absorbent article having laterally extending side flaps that can be folded over the absorbent article before use to protect the absorbent material carried by the article, and that also can be folded over the absorbent material and attached to each other after use of the article, to enable convenient and sanitary disposal of the used absorbent article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a disposable absorbent article having laterally outwardly extending side flaps that include a line of weakness to enable rapid and easy severance of the connected flaps after use of the article, to facilitate removal of the used article from a garment after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a disposable absorbent article having laterally outwardly extending side flaps, wherein particular areas of the side flaps are extensible to enable the flaps to extend as necessary to adapt to specific use-influenced stress conditions imposed on the flaps. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Briefly stated, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a disposable absorbent article is provided. The article is adapted to be worn and to be positioned relative to the wearer&apos;s body for receiving and retaining body waste fluids to prevent soiling of undergarments worn by the wearer. The absorbent article includes a liquid-impervious backsheet having a rear surface adapted to face toward the wearer&apos;s garments when the absorbent article is worn, and a front surface adapted to face toward the wearer&apos;s body when the absorbent article is worn, the backsheet including a pair of longitudinally extending side edges. An elongated absorbent core is provided for absorbing body waste fluids of the wearer while the absorbent article is worn, and is positioned in overlying relationship with the front surface of the backsheet. A liquid-pervious topsheet overlies the absorbent core and has a rear surface facing toward the absorbent core and a front surface facing toward and adapted to contact the wearer&apos;s body when the article is worn. A pair of side flaps extend laterally outwardly from the side edges of the absorbent core, each flap having a liquid-impervious outer surface adapted to face toward the wearer&apos;s garments when the absorbent article is worn, and an inner surface adapted to face toward the wearer&apos;s body when the absorbent article is worn, wherein each of the flaps extends laterally from the absorbent core longitudinal axis a distance sufficient to enable the flaps to be in at least partial overlapping relationship when each of the flaps is folded around respective edges of a crotch area of the undergarment after initial placement of the backsheet of the absorbent article in a desired position against the inner crotch surface of the undergarment, with at least one side flap having an area of elastic extensibility defined by a plurality of laterally spaced, longitudinally extending, parallel ridges and alternating parallel grooves formed in the at least one side flap to allow the at least one side flap to elastically extend in response to stresses applied to the at least one side flap when the absorbent article is placed in position against the inner crotch surface of the undergarment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a line of weakness is formed in at least one side flap of the absorbent article to facilitate rapid and trouble-free removal of the article after use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, a method of folding a disposable absorbent article is provided to enclose the body-contacting surfaces thereof both before and after use to maintain cleanliness.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;absorbent article&rdquo; applies to an article that is intended to be worn by a person or to be carried on the body of a person in such a position on the body as to absorb and to contain bodily exudates and discharges; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; applies to an absorbent article that is not intended to be laundered or otherwise treated or restored to enable reuse as an absorbent article, but that is intended to be discarded after a single use, and, preferably, to be recycled, composted, or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;unitary&rdquo; as applied to an absorbent article refers to an absorbent article that is formed of separate parts that are joined or united together in such a way as to form a coordinated entity so that it does not require adjuncts or separate and distinct parts, such as a separate holder and pad, in order to function for the intended purpose; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;sanitary napkin&rdquo; refers to a unitary, disposable, absorbent article that is worn by females at the pudendal region adjacent to the externally visible female genitalia, generally external to the urogenital region, and that is intended to absorb and to contain fluids, such as menstrual fluids, urine, and other vaginal discharges that emanate from the wearer&apos;s body; it includes other feminine hygiene or catamenial pads, such as articles sometimes referred to as &ldquo;pantiliners,&rdquo; other absorbent articles, such as absorbent pads sometimes referred to as incontinence pads, interlabial devices that are positioned partially within and partially without the wearer&apos;s vaginal cleft, and the like. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Overall Structure of the Absorbent Article </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of a disposable absorbent article in accordance with the present invention is a catamenial pad or sanitary napkin that can have a structure of the type shown in the several drawing figures. Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a unitary, disposable, absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a flat, thin, flexible, liquid-permeable topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a fluid-absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is thicker than topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a flat, thin, liquid-impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the major outwardly-facing surfaces of article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are defined by topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and by backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned between topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in use, topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is intended to be positioned against or closely adjacent to the body of a wearer at or closely adjacent to a point where liquid is discharged from the body, so that the discharged liquid can pass through topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and can be absorbed by and collected in absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is outermost, relative to the body of the wearer, and it serves to prevent liquid absorbed by and carried by absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from wetting a garment that is worn by the wearer adjacent to absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a top plan view of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its flat, opened condition, before it is positioned for use adjacent the body of the wearer. Topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is uppermost, relative to the viewer, and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is lowermost. Thus, in the orientation of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the uppermost, liquid-absorbing surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the surface that is in contact with topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and that faces and is adjacent the wearer&apos;s body when article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in use, is shown as facing the viewer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Conversely, the lowermost surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, that faces away from the body of the wearer when absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in use, is in contact with backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and therefore lowermost surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view that more clearly shows the overall structure of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the relative positions of topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Backsheet Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is impervious to liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) and prevents the liquids that are absorbed by and contained in absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from wetting clothing articles such as pants, pajamas, and undergarments, clothing articles that could come into contact with absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is made from a thin, flexible, liquid-impervious plastic film, although other flexible, liquid-impervious materials can also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; refers to materials that are compliant and will readily conform to the general shape and contours of the human body. Backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can thus be made from a soft, flexible, liquid-impervious woven or nonwoven material; from a flexible, liquid-impervious polymeric film, for example a thermoplastic film such as polyethylene or polypropylene; or from a soft, flexible, liquid-impervious composite material, such as a film-coated nonwoven material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Preferably, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed from a thin, polyethylene film having a thickness of from about 0.012 mm (0.5 mil) to about 0.051 mm (2.0 mils). Examples of suitable polyethylene films are those films manufactured by Clopay Corporation, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and sold under the designation P18-0401, and by Tredegar Industries, Inc., of Terre Haute, Ind., and sold under the designation XP-39385. If provided in the form of a polymeric film, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can advantageously be embossed with a predetermined embossing pattern, or it can be matte finished, to provide a more cloth-like appearance to its surface. Additionally, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can optionally be made from a flexible, liquid-impervious material that permits vapors to pass therethrough. Therefore, when such a backsheet is employed, vapors can escape from absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and can pass through backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, because the backsheet is breathable, while at the same time preventing liquids and other exudates from passing from absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the backsheet. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Absorbent Core Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be any material that is capable of absorbing and retaining bodily liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine). For example, absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be made from a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials of the type commonly found in sanitary napkins and in other disposable absorbent articles. Specific examples of suitable absorbent materials include comminuted wood pulp, which is generally referred to as &ldquo;airfelt;&rdquo; creped cellulose wadding; meltblown polymers, including coform; chemically stiffened, modified, or cross-linked cellulosic fibers; synthetic fibers, such as crimped polyester fibers; peat moss; tissue, including tissue wraps and tissue laminates; absorbent foams; absorbent sponges; superabsorbent polymers; absorbent gelling materials; any equivalent material capable of absorbing liquids; and combinations or mixtures of the foregoing materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The configuration and construction of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can also be changed from that shown in the drawings. For example, absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, including, but not limited to, rectangular, oval, hourglass, dog bone, asymmetric, and the like, and it can have zones of different thicknesses at different portions of the core, such as a profile that is thicker in the center of absorbent article <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> than adjacent its edges. Additionally, absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can have hydrophilic gradients, superabsorbent gradients, or lower density and lower average basis weight acquisition zones, or it can include one or more layers or additional structures. Preferably, however, the liquid-absorbing capacity of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is made to be compatible with the intended loading of liquid, which is based upon the intended duration and conditions of use of the absorbent article. In that regard, the physical size and the absorbent capacity of the absorbent core can be changed to accommodate different use conditions of the absorbent article, such as incontinence pads, pantiliners, regular sanitary napkins, or overnight sanitary napkins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Additional examples of absorbent structures that can be used to provide the absorbent core of a sanitary napkin in accordance with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,264, entitled, &ldquo;Thin, Flexible Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 21, 1990, to Osborn; U.S. Pat. No. 4,610,678, entitled, &ldquo;High-Density Absorbent Structures,&rdquo; which issued on Sep. 9, 1986, to Weisman et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,735, entitled, &ldquo;High Density Absorbent Members Having Lower Density and Lower Basis Weight Acquisition Zones,&rdquo; which issued on May 30, 1989, to Alemany et al.; and European Patent Application No. 0 198 683, which was published on Oct. 22, 1986, in the name of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company as applicant, and identifying Duenk et al. as inventors. The disclosures of each of the foregoing patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Topsheet Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the wearer&apos;s skin, and it is necessarily liquid pervious to permit liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) to readily penetrate through its thickness and into the absorbent core. A suitable topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be made from a wide range of liquid-pervious materials, including woven and nonwoven materials; polymeric materials, such as apertured, formed thermoplastic films, apertured plastic films, and hydroforned thermoplastic films; porous foams; reticulated foams; reticulated thermoplastic films; and thermoplastic scrims. Suitable woven and nonwoven materials can include natural fibers (e.g., wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g., polymeric fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene fibers), or a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A preferred topsheet structure is an apertured, formed, liquid-pervious film. Apertured, formed films are preferred for the topsheet because they are pervious to body exudates, yet they are non-absorbent and therefore they do not feel wet. Additionally, such films advantageously exhibit a reduced tendency to allow liquids that pass therethrough to pass back from the absorbent core through the topsheet to wet the wearer&apos;s skin. Thus, the surface of an apertured, formed film that is in contact with the body remains dry, thereby reducing body soiling and resulting in a more comfortable feel for the person wearing the absorbent article. Suitable apertured, formed films are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135, entitled, &ldquo;Absorptive Structures Having Tapered Capillaries,&rdquo; which issued on Dec. 30, 1975, to Thompson; in U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,246, entitled, &ldquo;Disposable Absorbent Article Having A Stain Resistant Topsheet&rdquo;, which issued on Apr. 13, 1982, to Mullane, et al.; in U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,314, entitled, &ldquo;Resilient Plastic Web Exhibiting Fiber-Like Properties,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 3, 1982, to Radel et al.; in U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,045, entitled, &ldquo;Macroscopically Expanded Three-Dimensional Plastic Web Exhibiting Non-Glossy Visible Surface and Cloth-Like Tactile Impression,&rdquo; which issued on Jul. 31, 1984, to Ahr et al.; and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,006,394, entitled, &ldquo;Multilayer Polymeric Film,&rdquo; which issued on Apr. 9, 1991, to Baird. The disclosures of each of the foregoing patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The preferred topsheet for the present invention is an apertured, formed film as described in one or more of the foregoing patents and also those topsheets included as a part of sanitary napkins made and sold by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and known as &ldquo;DRI-WEAVE.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the body-facing surface of the apertured, formed film topsheet is hydrophilic to facilitate liquid transfer through the topsheet at a faster rate than if the body surface were not hydrophilic. That property of the topsheet reduces the likelihood that menstrual or other fluid will flow off the surface of the topsheet, rather than flowing through it and being absorbed by the absorbent core as intended. In one preferred embodiment, a surfactant is incorporated into the polymeric material of the apertured, formed film topsheet, as is described in U.S. Statutory Invention Registration No. H1,670, entitled, &ldquo;Absorbent Article Having A Nonwoven and Apertured Film Coversheet,&rdquo; published on Jul. 1, 1997, in the names of Aziz, et al. as inventors, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the body-facing surface of the topsheet can be made hydrophilic by treating it with a surfactant in the manner described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,254, entitled, &ldquo;Thin, Flexible Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 21, 1990, to Osborn, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Assembly of the Several Elements of the Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are preferably coextensive with each other and have respective outermost edges that are joined to each other along a joinder seam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that extends either outwardly of or adjacent the peripheral edges of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned and is retained between topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Additionally, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are also preferably joined both to absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and to each other outwardly of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, by a suitable attachment arrangement (not shown), a number of which attachment arrangements are known to those having skill in the art. For example, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or both, can be secured to absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or to each other, by a uniformly thick, continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned, discontinuous layer of adhesive, or an array of spaced lines, spirals, spots, or other spaced forms of discrete adhesive areas. Adhesives that have been found to be satisfactory for that purpose are manufactured by the H. B. Fuller Company, of St. Paul, Minn., under the designations HL-1258 and H-2031. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A preferred attachment arrangement for joining the backsheet and the topsheet includes an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive, as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,986, entitled, &ldquo;Disposable Waste-Containment Garment&rdquo;, which issued on Mar. 4, 1986, to Minetola, et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. An example of another form of suitable attachment arrangement is an open pattern network of filaments that includes several lines of adhesive filaments swirled into a spiral pattern that can be applied by the apparatus and method shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,911,173, which issued on Oct. 7, 1975, to Sprague, Jr.; in U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,996, entitled, &ldquo;Adhesive Spray Gun and Nozzle Attachment,&rdquo; which issued on Nov. 22, 1978, to Ziecker, et al.; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,666, entitled, &ldquo;Process for the Permanent Joining of Stretchable Threadlike or Small Ribbonlike Elastic Elements to a Flat Substrate, as well as Use Thereof for Producing Frilled Sections of Film of Foil Strip,&rdquo; which issued on Jun. 27, 1989, to Werenicz. The disclosures of each of the foregoing patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the attachments between the backsheet, the topsheet, and the absorbent core can be effected in the form of heat bonds, pressure bonds, ultrasonic bonds, dynamic mechanical bonds, or any other suitable attachment arrangements that are known to those having skill in the art, and combinations of any such attachments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Although topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed and assembled in a variety of well-known configurations (including so called &ldquo;tube&rdquo; products or so-called &ldquo;side flap&rdquo; products), a preferred sanitary napkin structural arrangement of the several elements of such articles to provide the benefits of the present invention can conform generally with those structures described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,264, entitled, &ldquo;Thin, Flexible Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 21, 1990, to Osborn; U.S. Pat. No. 4,425,130, entitled, &ldquo;Compound Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on Jan. 10, 1984, to DesMarais; U.S. Pat. No. 4,321,924, entitled, &ldquo;Bordered Disposable Absorbent Article,&rdquo; which issued on Mar. 30, 1982, to Ahr; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478, entitled, &ldquo;Shaped Sanitary Napkin With Flaps,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 18, 1987, to Van Tilburg. In that regard, the disclosure of each of the foregoing patents is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Liquid Transport Layer </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Optionally, one or more transport layers <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) can be positioned between topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or it or they can be attached to the garment-facing surface of topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form a composite topsheet. A transport layer can perform several functions, including spacing absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> a slightly greater distance from the skin of the wearer, to further reduce the likelihood of the wearer experiencing a feeling of wetness, and also improving the lateral transport of liquid exudates across and along upper surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a wicking effect. Improved lateral transport or wicking of liquid exudates over the surface of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is desirable because it promotes a more even distribution of the liquid exudates into the interior of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, transport layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> enables absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be thinner than it would otherwise be, because the entire absorptive capacity of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be more efficiently utilized for liquid absorption, as opposed to absorption only within a local area of the absorbent core at the point where liquid exudates first contact the absorbent article. The wicking effect referred to herein includes the transportation of liquids to, along the surface of, and into the absorbent core in one, two, or all directions (i.e., in the x-y plane and/or in the z-direction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Transport layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be made from several different materials, including thin, nonwoven or woven webs of synthetic fibers that can also include polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene; natural fibers, such as cotton or cellulose; blends of natural and synthetic fibers; and any equivalent materials or combinations of materials. The structures of sanitary napkins having both a transport layer and a topsheet are more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,264, entitled, &ldquo;Thin, Flexible Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 21, 1990, to Osborn; and in published PCT application No. PCT/US92/09716, entitled, &ldquo;Absorbent Article Having Fused Layers,&rdquo; published on Jun. 24, 1993, as International Publication No. WO93/11725. The disclosures of each of those publications are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. In a preferred embodiment, transport layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is joined with topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by any of the conventional means for joining webs together, most preferably by fusion bonds, as is more fully described in the above-identified PCT publication. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Additional Absorbent Sheet </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A flat, thin, absorbent lower sheet can optionally be positioned between topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, particularly in the areas defined by the outwardly-extending side flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, which shows such a flat, thin, absorbent lower sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in position between topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Absorbent lower sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> extends over the body-facing surfaces or each of the flaps, and it also underlies absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. That positional arrangement is preferred for convenience of manufacture. It also enhances the functioning of the absorbent article by providing additional absorption capacity. Absorbent lower sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can absorb body fluids that are not absorbed by absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or that are expressed from core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> while the article is worn and as a consequence of the wearer&apos;s movements. Absorbent lower sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is generally compressible, flexible, and non-irritating to the wearer&apos;s skin. It can be made from any of the materials that are identified above for making absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Absorbent lower sheet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can also be made from a tissue paper sheet, if desired, to minimize the overall thickness of the flaps, but it can also be a thicker absorbent material, if desired. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an embodiment of an absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the form of a sanitary napkin in which absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is of elongated form and has a longitudinal central axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a transverse central axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As shown, absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is symmetrical about each of axes <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and it has rounded ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, as also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, absorbent core is wider at its longitudinal ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> than it is at its center <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;longitudinal&rdquo; refers to a line, an axis, or a direction in the plane of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is generally aligned with (e.g., approximately parallel to) a vertical plane that passes through a standing wearer of the article to bisect the wearer into substantially equal left and right body halves. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;transverse&rdquo; and &ldquo;lateral&rdquo; are interchangeable with each other and refer to a line, an axis, or a direction that lies within a plane of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal line, axis, or direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Preferably, topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> each have respective length and width dimensions that are larger than the corresponding dimensions of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> each extend beyond each of ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and also beyond its side edges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, to thereby define not only outer or peripheral portions of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but also a pair of laterally outwardly extending side flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Side Flap Configuration and Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Side flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are adjacent to and extend outwardly from respective side edges <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed in its use position within the crotch region of an undergarment (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), flaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> each loosely drape over the inner edges of the respective leg openings of the wearer&apos;s undergarment, or panty, at the crotch region of the garment, so that the flaps are positioned between the respective inner edge portions of each of the leg openings of the wearer&apos;s panty and the inner portions of each of the wearer&apos;s thighs when the panty is worn and the absorbent article is in its preferred position adjacent the wearer&apos;s body. The lateral distance to which flaps <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extend outwardly from the core is a distance sufficient to permit the flaps to at least partially overlap when each of the flaps is folded over the respective inner edge of a leg opening of the panty and the flaps are positioned in overlapping relationship against the outwardly-facing surface of the crotch area of the panty. In that regard, the crotch width of a typical female panty generally ranges in width from about 5.0 cm. (1.9 in.) to about 7.5 cm. (2.95 in.), although it can also be wider in some countries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> serve at least two purposes. First, the flaps are interposed between the wearer&apos;s panty and the wearer&apos;s inner thighs, to avoid soiling of the wearer&apos;s body and panty by bodily exudates in liquid form. The flaps provide that benefit by forming along the edges of the leg openings of the panty a barrier to the passage of liquid. Second, the overlapped flaps help to keep the sanitary napkin properly positioned in a longitudinal direction along the crotch region of the panty. In that regard, one or both flaps are provided with suitable attachment means so that the flaps can be attached to each other adjacent the outer, or garment-facing side of the panty after the flaps have been folded around the inner edges of the leg openings of the panty and against the outside surface of the crotch region of the panty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A number of sanitary napkin structures having side flaps suitable or adaptable for use with a sanitary napkin in accordance with the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478, entitled, &ldquo;Shaped Sanitary Napkin With Flaps,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 18, 1987, to Van Tilburg; in U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkin,&rdquo; which issued on May 20, 1986, to Van Tilburg; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,047, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 26, 1986, to Mattingly. The disclosures of each of those patents are incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be made in various shapes, including those shapes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and they can be made from a variety of suitable materials, including materials similar to those employed to make topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as well as tissue, or a combination of those materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are each lateral extensions of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and of topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and they are of generally trapezoidal form. Thus flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are each two-ply structures, wherein the body-contacting surface of each flap is the same soft material as that of topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the garment-facing surface of each flap is the same material as that of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Such a two-ply structure is desirable in that the body-contacting surfaces of the flaps provide a soft, compliant, non-irritating feeling that adds to the wearer&apos;s comfort. And the liquid-impervious nature of the garment-facing surfaces of the flaps provides additional protection to the wearer&apos;s clothing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Flap Fastening Systems </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> carries a respective element of a suitable flap fastening system for fastening the flaps together after they have been folded over and positioned against the outermost surface of the crotch area of the panty. The fastening system includes a first fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, each of which can include mechanical fastening elements. As used herein, the term &ldquo;mechanical fastening elements&rdquo; includes fastening elements that mechanically engage each other and that also enable the flaps to be attached to each other over a range of degrees of overlap of the flaps. Such mechanical fastening elements can include any of the well-known fastening elements that achieve a variable-position attachment by mechanical engagement, such as VELCRO or other hook- and loop-type fastening elements. Such other hook-and loop-type fastening elements include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,058,247, entitled, &ldquo;Mechanical Fastening Prong,&rdquo; which issued on Oct. 22, 1991, to Thomas et al., and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,563, entitled, &ldquo;Process for Producing a Mechanical Fastener,&rdquo; which issued on May 26, 1992, to Thomas et al. As used herein, &ldquo;variable-position&rdquo; fastening elements are those fastening elements that can be fastened together over a range of overlap positions of the fastener elements and without the necessity for precise positioning of each of the fastener elements relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When a first fastener element includes a mechanical closure element, the second fastener element can include &ldquo;identical&rdquo; complementary mechanical fastening elements. Alternatively, the second fastener element can include &ldquo;distinct&rdquo; complementary mechanical fastening elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; as applied to a fastener system refers to the components of a two-component fastener system, wherein the components are engageable with each other to effect a fastened connection therebetween that will resist inadvertent separation of the components, yet will permit manual separation of the components upon the application to the components of a sufficiently large separation force. The components can each be the same material, such as an adhesive that will adhere to itself, or they can each be different materials, such as an adhesive and a surface to which the adhesive can adhere, or such as a hook fastener element and a loop fastener element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;identical&rdquo; as applied to complementary mechanical fastening elements identifies a mechanical fastening system wherein the engaging elements of the first and second fastener elements have the same configuration and have respective structures that interconnect to hold the fastener elements together. Examples of such systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,322,875, entitled, &ldquo;Two Strip Materials Used For Forming Fasteners,&rdquo; which issued on Apr. 16, 1982, to Brown, et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;distinct&rdquo; as applied to complementary mechanical fastening elements refers to mechanical fastening systems wherein a first fastener element is structurally different from a second fastener element, but is engageable therewith, such as a hook-based fastening material and a loop-based fastening material. For example, if the second fastener element is a loop-based fastening material, then the first fastener element will be a hook-based fastening material, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hook-based fastening material&rdquo; identifies a material having engagement elements. Thus, the hook-based fastening material can also be referred to as a male fastener. It should also be understood that the use of the term &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is non-limiting in the sense that the engagement elements can be of any suitable shapes, such as those engagement elements known to those skilled in the art, so long as they are adapted to engage a complementary mechanical closure element, such as a loop-based fastening material or even another hook-based fastening material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A hook-based fastening material is preferably adapted to mechanically engage fibrous elements of a loop-based fastening material in order to provide a secure connection between those elements. Thus, a hook-based fastening material according to the present invention can be manufactured from a wide range of materials. Suitable materials include nylon, polyester, polypropylene, or any combination of those materials or of other suitable materials that are known to those skilled in the art. A suitable hook-based fastening material includes a number of shaped engagement elements that project from a backing, such as the commercially-available material designated SCOTCHMATE Brand, No. FJ3402, available from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, of St. Paul, Minn. The engaging elements can have any shape, such as hooks, &ldquo;T&apos;s&rdquo;, mushrooms, or any other effective shape that is known to those skilled in the art. A suitable hook-based fastening material is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,815, entitled, &ldquo;Disposable Diaper Having An Improved Fastening Device,&rdquo; which issued on Jul. 11, 1989, to Scripps, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An especially preferred hook-based fastening material includes an array of prongs that are formed of thermoplastic material. Hot melt adhesive thermoplastics, in particular polyester and polyamide hot melt adhesives, are particularly well suited for forming the prongs of the hook-based fastening material. The prongs are preferably manufactured using a modified gravure printing process by printing the thermoplastic material in its molten state onto a substrate in discrete units, severing the material in a manner that allows stretching of a portion of the thermoplastic material before severance, and allowing the stretched molten material to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo;, or solidify, resulting in prongs. This preferred hook-based fastening material and methods and apparatus for making such a hook-based fastening material are more fully described in European Patent Application No. 0 381 087, owned by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, and published on Aug. 8, 1990, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A loop-based fastening material generally provides a plurality of fibrous elements that can engage with the complementary engagement elements of a hook-based fastening material. The loop-based fastening element can be manufactured from a wide range of materials to provide the fibrous elements, which are preferably in the form of loops. Suitable materials that can form the loop-based fastening element include nylon, polyester, polypropylene, combinations of those materials, and other suitable materials that are known to those skilled in the art. One such suitable loop-based fastening material includes a number of fiber loops that project outwardly from a backing, such as the commercially available material designated SCOTCHMATE Brand nylon woven loop, No. SJ3401, available from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, of St. Paul, Minn. Another commercially available loop-based fastening material includes a tricot knit fabric having a plurality of nylon filament loops projecting outwardly from a nylon backing, such as the loop-based fastening material commercially available from Guilford Mills, of Greensboro, N.C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A suitable and relatively inexpensive loop-based fastening material and a method of making such a loop-based fastening material are described in European Patent Application No. 0 289 198, owned by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, and published on Nov. 2, 1988, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The loop-based fastening material can also be a woven or a nonwoven fabric, or any other type of suitable fibrous material or loop-containing material that is known to those skilled in the art. Examples of nonwoven materials suitable for use as a loop-based fastening material include those identified herein as useful for serving as topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the loop-based fastening material is a nonwoven material of which topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An example of a fastening system wherein the first and second fastening elements each include mechanical closure elements including hook and loop-based fastening materials is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,869,724, entitled, &ldquo;Mechanical Fastening Systems With Adhesive Tape Disposal Means For Disposable Absorbent Articles,&rdquo; which issued on Sep. 26, 1989, to Scripps. Fastening systems utilizing mechanical closure elements are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,815, entitled, &ldquo;Disposable Diaper Having An Improved Fastening Device,&rdquo; which issued on Jul. 11, 1989, to Scripps; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,060, entitled, &ldquo;Disposable Diaper With Improved Hook Fastener Portion,&rdquo; which issued on Jan. 16, 1990, to Nestegard. A primary fastening system having a combination of adhesive and mechanical closure elements is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,527, entitled, &ldquo;Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Fastener And Method of Making Same,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 7, 1990, to Battrell. The disclosures of each of the foregoing patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the fastening system can include a layer of adhesive material. Adhesives useful in the present invention are preferably pressure-sensitive adhesives formulated to adhere to a variety of types of surfaces at ambient temperature by applying only light pressure. Particularly preferred adhesives for use herein as an adhesive attachment layer are various hot-melt, pressure-sensitive adhesives known to those skilled in the art. An example of a suitable hot-melt, pressure-sensitive adhesive is a Kraton-based adhesive with tackifiers and other additives, such as that marketed by Findley Adhesives, Inc., of Elm Grove, Wis., under the trade names FINDLEY 990 or FINDLEY H-2085. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Additional examples of suitable pressure-sensitive adhesives are Century A-305-IV, manufactured and sold by Century Adhesives Corporation, of Columbus, Ohio, and Instant Lock 34-2823, manufactured and sold by National Starch &amp; Chemical Company, of Bridgewater, N.J. Suitable adhesive fasteners are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkins Having Flaps and Stress Relief Means,&rdquo; which issued is on Apr. 17, 1990, to Osbom, III et al., the disclosure of which was earlier incorporated herein by reference. The pressure-sensitive adhesives intended for use in connection with the present invention retain sufficient tackiness, even after an initial adhesive attachment bond is separated, to remain effective to permit a sufficiently strong reattachment bond so that the flaps can again be securely reattached to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> When pressure-sensitive adhesive is employed in the form of an adhesive layer carried by the absorbent article, the adhesive layer can be covered with a removable release liner strip before the article is used, to prevent the adhesive from contacting an unintended surface before use. Suitable release liner strips include those commercially available release liner strips known as BL30MG-A Silox E1/0 and BL30MG-A Silox 4P/O, manufactured and sold by Akrosil Corporation, of Menasha, Wis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> When the first fastener element is an adhesive layer, the second fastener element preferably is a release area, to enable the fastener elements to be separated and subsequently reattached, if desired by the wearer. The release area can be the backsheet itself when the adhesive is of the type that adheres to the backsheet with a sufficient holding force to hold the napkin in position, but that also permits release of the fastener connection without tearing of the backsheet and that also permits subsequent reattachment of the adhesive to the backsheet with a sufficient holding force to hold the napkin in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Whether an adhesive and backsheet arrangement can be successfully utilized is dependent upon the nature of the backsheet material, its tensile strength, the nature of its surface, and the force necessary to separate the adhesive from the backsheet. If the backsheet is thin and could possibly be torn by the removal of the adhesive first fastener element from the backsheet, then preferably the second fastener element is a discrete, separate release layer or release coating that is securely joined to the backsheet, such as by a strong adhesive bond. The release layer or coating preferably has a surface that enables the adhesive fastener element to securely, yet releasably, adhere to, to be removed from, and to re-adhere to the release layer with sufficient tenacity to provide a good bond after several attachments and removals of the fastener elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The fastening system elements can further include combinations of adhesive and mechanical fastener elements. For example, the fastening system elements can include a combination fastener, such as a hook-based fastening material and an adhesive attachment layer juxtaposed with the hook-based fastening material, or it can include a mechanical closure element, such as a hook-based fastening material having a layer of adhesive coated over a portion of the hook-based fastening material. An example of a fastener having a combination of a mechanical element and an adhesive element is a pressure-sensitive adhesive fastener having a textured fastening surface, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,527, entitled, &ldquo;Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Fastener And Method of Making Same,&rdquo; which issued on Aug. 7, 1990, to Battrell, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A fastening system for providing a variable attachment position fastener capable of being passively activated can alternatively further include any cohesive materials of the type that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, one form of cohesive material can be provided in strip form as foams, rubbers, such as crepe or latex rubbers, other adhesives, or a high-static-charge vinyl material. A separable fastener of a high static vinyl material is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,613, entitled, &ldquo;Separable Fastening Device,&rdquo; which issued on Dec. 25, 1990, to McLaughlin et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The fastening system elements can alternatively include a separate element joined to absorbent article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or it can be a unitary element joined with one of the other elements of the article. For example, topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be made from a material, such as a nonwoven web, that is capable of mechanically engaging the other attachment element, which can be a hook-based fastening material. Additionally, backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be formed from a web having a textured pattern and having a layer of adhesive coated over a portion of the garment-facing surface of the backsheet to form a combination fastener of mechanical and adhesive elements, such as is shown in the hereinbefore-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,527, which issued to Battrell. In each of those cases, the attachment element is unitary with another element of the absorbent article. Alternatively, the attachment element can include a discrete strip or patch joined to the absorbent article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment the first attachment element includes a discrete patch of a hook-based fastening material joined to the backsheet to form a portion of the outer surface of the backsheet, while the second attachment element is a unitary element forming a portion of the topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Positioning of the Napkin for Use </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In use, the absorbent article can be held in a desired position relative to the body of a wearer by any known holding or support means. Preferably, however, when the absorbent article is in the form of a sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed within the wearer&apos;s undergarment, or panty, on the interior surface at the crotch area of the panty, and is retained in that position by a suitable fastening arrangement, such as an adhesive carried on the outwardly-facing surface of the backsheet of the napkin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a fragmentary perspective view of a portion of a panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> showing the crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a front panel <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a rear panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, between each of which extends a narrow, elongated, crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that interconnects front and rear panels <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Additionally, panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a right leg opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a left leg opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Right leg opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> defines a right side crotch edge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and left leg opening <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> defines a left side crotch edge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with a napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its operative position within crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the panty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> An adhesive carried by sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> permits convenient and effective attachment of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the interior of panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Thus, as more clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, at least a portion of the outer, garment-facing surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably coated with a suitable adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Any adhesive or glue known to those skilled in the art can be used to attach napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the interior of panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, but pressure-sensitive adhesives are preferred. Suitable pressure-sensitive adhesives include CENTURY A-305-IV, manufactured by the Century Adhesives Corporation, of Columbus, Ohio, and INSTANT LOCK 34-2823, manufactured by the National Starch and Chemical Company, of Bridgewater, N.J. Other suitable adhesive fastening arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkins Having Flaps and Stress Relief Means,&rdquo; which issued on Apr. 17, 1990, to Osbom, III et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a removable release liner strip <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is placed against and in overlying, covering relationship with adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> before use of the sanitary napkin. Release liner strip <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> serves to keep adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from drying out, to keep it clean, and to prevent it from adhering to a surface other than the crotch portion of the panty before the napkin is positioned for use. Suitable release liner strips include those commercially available release liner strips known as BL30MG-A Silox E1/0 and BL30MG-A Silox 4P/O, manufactured and sold by the Akrosil Corporation, of Menasha, Wis. Other suitable release liners are disclosed in the hereinabove-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned for use by removing release liner strip <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and thereafter placing the napkin against the interior surface at crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, in the position shown generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, so that adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> contacts the interior surface of the panty at crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and adheres to it to maintain the napkin in the desired position within the panty. During positioning of the napkin within the panty, side flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are released from any interconnections therebetween and from any separate interconnecting members and are allowed to hang downwardly from napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and to extend into respective leg openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. When so disposed, side flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each overlie respective crotch edges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to cover those edges with liquid-impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and thereby protect them from contact with liquids that are carried by absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The panty with the napkin in position in the crotch area is then put on in the usual manner, so that the wearer&apos;s legs extend into the respective leg openings, and the panty is drawn upwardly into normal wearing position so that napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent the vaginal cleft of the wearer. The position of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be adjusted, if necessary or desired, by separating the adhesive bond holding napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the interior surface of crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, repositioning napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> relative to crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and then again pressing napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against the inner surface of crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to re-establish an adhesive bond therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been properly positioned for most effective absorption and comfort, any release strips carried by fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that were not previously removed are then removed. Flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is first placed against the outer surface of crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so that first fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> faces outwardly, and then flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is placed against the outermost surface of flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are in intimate contact with each other. Napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then securely positioned within panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in its preferred operative position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> If after napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned, or if after being worn for a time its position relative to panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or relative to the wearer&apos;s vaginal cleft should be incorrect for effective absorption of liquids, or should the napkin shift from its previous, preferred position, possibly because it was not properly positioned initially, the napkin can easily be repositioned and reattached. To do so the flaps are disconnected from each other, the adhesive area <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the napkin is disconnected from the interior surface of the panty at the crotch area, and napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is repositioned to a desired new position. Thereafter, adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is again pressed against the interior surface of crotch panel <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so that adhesive layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> again contacts the interior surface of the panty at crotch area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and adheres to it to maintain the napkin in the desired new position within the panty. The flaps are then reattached in the same manner as they were previously. Because the fastener elements are such that secure reattachment can effectively be made, the reattached napkin will continue to function properly and will remain in its new position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Description of Alternative Fastener Element Positions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, first and second fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are generally rectangularly-shaped and each fastener element is positioned on a different major surface of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. First fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> carried on flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned on the body-facing surface of topsheet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, whereas second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> carried on flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is positioned on garment-facing surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. And as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is of elongated form and each has a longitudinal axis that is generally parallel with longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a securement member that can be a layer of pressure sensitive adhesive, the hook or loop element of a hook-and loop-type fastening system, or a piece of double-sided adhesive tape carried on flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When in the form of a double-sided adhesive tape, fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating on its outwardly-facing surface and preferably it includes a release cover strip <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that overlies and protects the adhesive coating before use of the napkin. Similarly, when fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the form of a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive a release cover strip can also be included to cover and protect the adhesive layer. Fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can have a longitudinal length of the order of from about &frac12; inch to about 3 inches, and a transverse width of the order of from about &frac14; inch to about 1 inch. The length and width of fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be influenced by the shape of the flap, as well as by the lateral position of the fastener element relative to napkin longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in order for the fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to be properly positioned so they come into at least partial surface contact with each other when the flaps are brought into overlapping relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a contact surface that can be the complementary portion of a hook and loop fastener system, or it can be a release area that allows attachment, release, and reattachment of a pressure-sensitive-adhesive-bearing surface. As with first fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be of elongated form and can have a length and a width that is influenced by the shape of the flap, as well as by the lateral position of the fastener element relative to napkin longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In that regard, the length of second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be from about &frac12; inch to about 3 inches, and the width can be from about &frac14; inch to about 1 inch. Alternatively, second fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be garment-facing surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, without any additional elements, provided that first fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can securely and releasably be connected with that backsheet surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The lateral spacing of first and second fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> relative to longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is dependent, in part, upon the range of panty crotch widths. As noted earlier herein, the panty crotch width can vary; it is generally dependent upon the size of the panty. Consequently, the spacing between the fastener elements can be of the order of from about 4 inches to about 6&frac12; inches. However, if the backsheet surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is itself the second fastener element, then it is not critical where the first fastener element is positioned, so long as it is in a position to contact the outermost surface of flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when each of the flaps has been folded over the respective edges at the crotch area of the panty. Moreover, it will be apparent that the connection of the flaps of this napkin embodiment, when the napkin is to be connected with a panty, must be effected by following a particular flap folding sequence&mdash;specifically, flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> must be folded over the outer surface of the crotch area of the panty before flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, so that first fastener element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is facing the surface of flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to enable a secure connection to be effected between the two flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, each of flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> carries two fastener elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The fastener elements carried by a particular flap can be the same type of fastener element, or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, they can be complementary elements. In any event, one fastener element is positioned on the body-facing surface of one of the flaps, and a complementary or cooperating fastener element is positioned on the opposite, or garment-facing surface of the other flap. This embodiment of the invention permits either of the flaps to be folded over first and then connected with the other flap in at least partially overlapping relationship. It thereby simplifies the flap attachment process by eliminating the need for the wearer to fold the flaps in a particular sequence, as is necessary to utilize properly and effectively the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Again, the fastener elements employed can be any of the complementary elements of the fastening systems hereinbefore described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, both fastener elements carried by each flap are aligned with each other and are coextensive with each other. The respective fastener elements can be of any desired size, shape, and position, so long as the flaps can be connected together and retained in the desired overlapped position by the interconnected fastener elements of the respective flaps. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, fastener elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are pressure-sensitive adhesive areas that can be covered by respective release strips <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As earlier noted, however, other forms of complementary fastener elements can also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. In that embodiment the fastener elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are disposed on both flap surfaces, as in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. However, in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> embodiment the elongated first and second fastener elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are not coextensive with each other, but, instead, are angularly rotated with respect to each other, in this instance by an angle of substantially 90&deg;. That positioning arrangement enables flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be readily fastened together without the need for carefully aligning the centerlines of the respective flaps relative to each other to ensure overlap of the respective complementary fastening system elements. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the angular relationship between the fastener elements carried on a particular flap can be different from 90&deg;, if desired, so long as the fastener elements are angularly disposed relative to each other. The angular relationship of the fastener elements facilitates flap attachment and permits attachment of the flaps to each other even if the complementary fastener elements carried by the flaps are slightly offset from each other after the flaps have been folded over the edges of the crotch area of the panty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A still further embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, in which the fastening system elements <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are disposed with respect to each other in the same relative angular arrangement as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, except that the axes of each of the fastener elements has been rotated by 45&deg; relative to their positions in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> embodiment. As was the case with the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> embodiment, the orientation of the fastener elements in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> embodiment enables connection of the flaps with each other without the need to carefully align the centerlines of the flaps or to carefully align the fastener elements, because the orientation of the fastener elements provides a greater opportunity for at least partial overlap of the respective fastener elements for a large number of possible relative positions of the flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 16</cross-reference> show napkin structures wherein the flaps are provided by one or more separate and distinct, laterally extending members that are attached to the backsheet of the napkin. Moreover, as shown, the separate flap members can have their longitudinal axes aligned with transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the absorbent core, if desired. However, that position is not essential for satisfactory operation of those embodiments, and the flap members can be positioned at any desired and convenient position along the longitudinal centerline of the absorbent core of the napkin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, a non-integrally-formed, separate, unitary piece of flap material <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extends across napkin <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, on the backsheet side thereof. Flap material piece <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> defines each of the respective flaps, and it can be made from any of a number of materials, including materials that are different from the materials utilized to make the backsheet. For example, suitable materials for that purpose include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,663, entitled, &ldquo;Absorbent Articles Having Undergarment Covering Components with Zones of Extensibility,&rdquo; which issued on Sep. 24, 1996, to Weinberger et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. And by &ldquo;non-integrally-formed&rdquo; is meant that the flaps are not extensions of the backsheet material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The use of a separate piece of material for the flaps provides distinct advantages. First of all, non-integral flaps permit a much wider range of possible flap materials to be utilized to form the flaps. Such possible flap materials can be of a type that provide greater comfort, more softness, or that have a lower cost than integrally-formed flaps that are extensions of the backsheet and topsheet materials. Secondly, non-integral flaps permit more freedom in the manufacturing process in that the same production line can readily be utilized to manufacture sanitary napkins that do not have flaps, and then by adding a suitable flap application apparatus to attach the separate piece of material the same production line can be utilized to manufacture sanitary napkins having a pair of flaps defined by the separate piece of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>, two discrete flap members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are provided, one extending outwardly from each side of napkin <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Flaps <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be made of the same materials as were identified above in the context of unitary flap member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> and they can be secured to backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the same manner. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> embodiment, however, each of flaps <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is individually formed and is secured to garment-facing surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at respective positions that lie laterally outwardly of napkin longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Further embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 23</cross-reference>. In each of those further embodiments lateral extensibility has been imparted to discrete portions of each of the flaps, to permit a limited amount of lateral stretch of the flap material at those particular portions of the flaps, to respond to and to accommodate particular stresses imposed on the flaps when the napkin is placed in its desired operative position in the crotch area of a panty, or stresses applied to the flaps while the napkin is worn and is in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When positioned within the crotch area of a panty and worn, a sanitary napkin assumes generally the same U-shape that the panty crotch assumes, in a longitudinal direction of the panty crotch and napkin, because of the conformation of the adjacent anatomical surfaces of the body of the wearer. Similarly, the flaps and the joinder zones between and interconnecting the flaps with the main portion of the backsheet of the napkin also tend to assume what is generally a U-shape in the longitudinal direction of the napkin. Consequently, when the flaps are folded over respective U-shaped crotch edges <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>), the U-shaped fold line of the napkin, when viewed in a plane parallel with the longitudinal axis of the absorbent core, and the forces applied to the flaps during the flap folding and attachment operations, impose upon the flaps tensile stresses that are greatest at the longitudinal extremities of each of the fold lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> One approach to relieving the stresses in those areas of sanitary napkins having flaps involves the formation of V-shaped notches adjacent the flap fold lines, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697, entitled, &ldquo;Sanitary Napkins Having Flaps and Stress Relief Means,&rdquo; which was previously referred to herein and the disclosure of which was earlier incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, napkin <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of discrete, spaced, longitudinally extending ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that have been formed in each of the flaps at positions laterally outward from absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and along the general area of the napkin that when in use would include or be adjacent to a flap fold line. As shown, ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are of substantially equal length and are spaced laterally from each other by intervening grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The ridges and grooves are also generally parallel to each other and are substantially parallel to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> groove <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends between adjacent parallel ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, so that in cross section, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the alternating ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> define an area of pleats, corrugations, or wavy areas in each of the flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Formation of the ridges and grooves can be effected by embossing, or by employing similar techniques for deforming the flap material to form such ridge and groove elements. The shapes of suitable ridges and grooves, and methods and apparatus for forming them, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,801, entitled, &ldquo;Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-Like Behavior,&rdquo; which issued on May 21, 1996, to Chappell et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,793, entitled, &ldquo;Method for Incrementally Stretching Zero Strain Stretch Laminate Web in a Non-Uniform Manner to Impart a Varying Degree of Elasticity Thereto,&rdquo; which issued on Oct. 20, 1992, to Buell et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,897, entitled, &ldquo;Method for Incrementally Stretching a Zero Strain Stretch Laminate Web to Impart Elasticity Thereto,&rdquo; which issued on Dec. 1, 1992, to Weber et al. The disclosure of each of those patents is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The formation of a localized pattern of linear ridges and grooves in the positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> permits each of the flaps to be laterally elastically extensible, relative to absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for a limited distance. The degree of extensibility is dependent upon the nature of the flap material and the configuration and spacing of the ridges and grooves. The sizes and spacings of the ridges can be as disclosed in published PCT application No. PCT/US95/01472, entitled, &ldquo;Absorbent Articles,&rdquo; published on Aug. 10, 1995, as International Publication No. WO 95/20931, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if fully rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Because ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extend in the longitudinal direction of the napkin and along the entire longitudinal length of the flaps, portions of the flaps can be extended different distances along the entire lengths of the ridges and grooves, and need not be uniform in the direction of napkin transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Instead, the extension forces can be applied to a flap at an acute angle relative to transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in order to accommodate different levels of stress that could be imposed upon different portions of the flaps when the napkin is being connected with a panty and when the napkin is in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can also be so formed as to extend for a distance less than the entire flap longitudinal dimension, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19, 21</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In that regard, the longitudinally-positioned ridges and grooves enable the flaps to be stretched or extended laterally relative to the napkin and as may be necessary to accommodate the particular crotch width of a panty, from wide to narrow, and to still be capable of being positioned in overlapped relationship on the outer surface of the crotch area of the panty, regardless of the crotch width of the panty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, napkin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is structurally similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, but it includes additional zones of extensibility <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that are formed in small, discrete portions of each of the respective flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Zones of extensibility <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are of generally triangular shape, and include parallel ridges and grooves that are disposed so that their respective centerlines extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown, the lengths of the respective ridges increase in a direction from ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> toward transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The ridges and grooves defining extensibility zones <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> can have a cross-sectional appearance similar to those of ridges <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, to permit longitudinal extension of the flap material in the localized areas encompassed by those zones, to enable the flaps to respond to and to accommodate stresses in different directions that can be imposed on the flaps as a result of particular conditions during installation and use of the napkin. In that regard, extensibility zones <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> permit a limited degree of extensibility in a longitudinal direction of the napkin and serve to provide stress relief points at the intersection of the longitudinal extremities of the flaps and backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Extensibility zones <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are directed to providing a type of stress relief that is similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,697, which issued to Osborn, III et al., and which was identified and referred to earlier herein, in which stress-relief notches are provided at the respective longitudinal ends of each of the flaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Further embodiments of a napkin having lateral extensibility and localized, angularly disposed extensibility zones are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 through 24</cross-reference>. Napkin <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> and napkin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> each can have the same basic, overall structure as that of napkin <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Extensibility zones <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference> are generally structurally similar to extensibility zones <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, in that they include a plurality of parallel, spaced ridges and grooves. However, extensibility zones <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> include ridges and grooves that are differently-oriented from those of extensibility zones <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> extensibility zones are provided adjacent the edge of the napkin at substantially the junctions between the longitudinal ends of the flaps and the body of the napkin similar to the general positions of the extensibility zones shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> embodiment, however, the ridges and grooves are of substantially the same length, and the centerlines of the respective ridges and grooves are disposed at an acute angle relative both to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as well as to transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In the napkin embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>, extensibility zones <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are of generally triangular form and are defined by a plurality of spaced, parallel ridges and grooves. The ridges and grooves are disposed at an acute angle relative to the napkin longitudinal and transverse axes. The disposition and lengths of the ridges and grooves in extensibility zones <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are such that the ridges and grooves are longer adjacent outer edge <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and they gradually diminish in length in an inward direction that is perpendicular to their respective centerlines. As shown, the ridges and grooves define zones of extensibility <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in the form of isosceles triangles, although other generally triangular forms of zones of extensibility having the ridge centerlines oriented as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> can also be employed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Methods of Folding the Napkins </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Because of the releasability and reattachability attributes of the flap fastening systems that preferably are utilized in connection with the present invention, the flaps and the fastening system can advantageously be used to hold the napkin in folded form. Before use, folding the napkin to a smaller, more compact size permits more convenient handling of the napkin for packaging purposes prior to sale, and it enables the user to carry one or more in her purse, if desired. After use, the napkin can be refolded to permit convenient and sanitary disposal of the used napkin. One form of folding technique and sequence for a napkin having the flap and fastening system structure hereinbefore described, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, is shown sequentially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 through 28</cross-reference>, in which napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is folded in a manner to provide a more compact, generally rectangular structure that is more convenient to package and to carry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown after the completion of the first step in the folding sequence, after end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has been folded inwardly along any convenient fold line toward transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to overlie absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The fold line can be any convenient transversely extending line that lies between the outer edge of end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, but preferably it is so selected as to cause at least a portion of end <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to lie between flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As the second step in the folding sequence, end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is folded inwardly to overlie absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by folding about any convenient fold line that is lies between the outermost edge of end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Again, the fold line is so selected as to cause at least a portion of end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to lie between flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, which shows the napkin after the completion of the second step of the folding sequence, the respective ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, when folded inwardly onto absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, are in partially overlapped relationship with end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> uppermost. However, if desired, the flap fold lines can be so selected that the outermost edges of respective ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the napkin are spaced from each other after both ends have been folded, or the fold lines can be so selected that the outermost edges of respective ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are in contacting relationship, rather than in overlapping relationship. The latter two positions of the folded-over napkin ends, with ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in non-overlapped relationship, serve to reduce the overall thickness of the completely folded napkin, as compared with the thickness of the folded napkin having ends that partially overlap when folded inwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the next step in the folding sequence is for flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be is folded inwardly over the already inwardly-folded ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is folded inwardly over each of the already inwardly-folded ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and also partially over flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, so that fastener elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> engage each other, to thereby hold the folded-over portions of the napkin in their respective folded-over positions and to provide the completed folded napkin as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. The flap fastening system hereinbefore described in the context of the invention as it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> is utilized in the folding operation to secure the two flaps together over the inwardly-folded ends <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and thereby provide a closed, self-contained napkin that is of a more convenient size for a user to carry in her purse than if the napkin were in its flat, opened form as it is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> When napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in its folded condition as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, each of the outwardly facing surfaces of the folded napkin is a portion of the garment-facing surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of backsheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or of the garment-facing surfaces of flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, so that each of the body-facing surfaces of the napkin is within the interior of the folded article, and is not exposed, to maintain the cleanliness of the absorbent portion of the napkin before use, as well as to maintain cleanliness after use and after refolding, to enable convenient carrying of the used napkin until proper disposal can be effected. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Additional Embodiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention to facilitate folding of the napkin into a convenient form both before and after use is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 through 32</cross-reference>. In that embodiment, the garment-facing surface at each of ends <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a pair of first fastener elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of a fastening system, with a fastener element disposed on each side of longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at each end of napkin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A cooperating pair of complementary, second fastener elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is provided on each of side flaps <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, on the respective body-facing surfaces thereof Second fastener elements <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on each flap are disposed in spaced relationship with each other and on each side of transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. This embodiment is adapted to be in a folded condition before use, with no fastening elements exposed, and therefore it does not require separate release strips to cover adhesive-containing areas. Consequently, this embodiment when in folded condition exposes no sticky surfaces, requires less adhesive, and provides cost savings because of the reduced quantity of adhesive needed and also because of the elimination of separate release strips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The folding sequence for napkin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is similar to that for napkin <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 through 28</cross-reference>. The folding sequence includes the steps of sequentially folding inwardly each of ends <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> about fold lines that extend generally parallel to transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, so that the ends each overlie absorbent core <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. As there shown, the respective outermost edges of each of ends <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the napkin preferably are not in overlapped condition, but are either in contacting relationship, or they can be slightly spaced from each other, as visible in the right side view of the folded napkin as it is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. After both ends <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> have been folded inwardly, each of flaps <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is individually folded inwardly about suitable respective fold lines that extend generally parallel to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, so that the adjacent first and second fastener elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> contact each other to provide a completely closed, folded assembly in the form shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, in which flaps <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are not overlapped, to minimize the overall thickness of the completely-folded napkin. Although illustrated and described in the context of pairs of fastener elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on respective ends and flaps of the napkins, unitary fastener elements (not shown) can be substituted for each pair of fastener elements shown, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</cross-reference>, which illustrate an asymmetrical napkin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> having a greater width at end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> than at end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Wider end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> includes outwardly extending lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to accommodate a larger absorbency area and absorbency volume by permitting an asymmetric absorbent core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> having an enlarged end to be employed. Absorbent core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably asymmetrical relative to transverse axis <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> but is preferably symmetrical relative to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Each of lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> carries on the garment-facing surface of the lobe one fastener element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the narrower, opposite end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes on the garment-facing surface of that end a pair of laterally spaced, complementary fastener elements <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that are complementary with and engageable with fastener elements <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> carried on the backsheet side of each of lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In that regard, if desired a single, elongated fastener element (not shown), having a longitudinal axis that extends transversely relative to the longitudinal axis of core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, can be provided instead of the two spaced fastener elements <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, ends <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and flaps <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> embodiment can be folded inwardly to provide a closed, folded napkin in a manner similar to the folding sequence generally illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 through 28</cross-reference>. However, initially lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are each sequentially folded inwardly about respective fold lines that extend in a generally parallel direction relative to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, so that each of the lobes overlies absorbent core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with its respective fastener element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> facing upwardly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. After lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> have been folded over, they are not in overlapped relationship, and their outermost edges can be spaced from each other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, although the outermost edges of the folded-over lobes can also be in contact with each other, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> After lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> have been folded inwardly, narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is then folded inwardly about a generally transversely-extending fold line to overlie absorbent core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. After narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> has been folded over, fastener elements <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> carried by narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> face upwardly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. Additionally, it is preferred that narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> be so oriented after folding that fastener elements <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> carried by narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can engage fastener elements <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> carried by lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Wide end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that includes lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is then folded inwardly about a transversely extending fold line to overlie absorbent core <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The fold line is preferably so selected that when wide end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is folded over, fastener elements <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> carried by lobes <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> overlie the respective complementary fastener elements <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> on the upwardly-facing surface of folded-over narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. When folded-over wider end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is pressed against folded-over narrow end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the respective fastener elements <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> engage each other to hold and to maintain the narrow and wide ends of napkin <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in partially overlapped relationship, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. Thereafter, flap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is folded inwardly over folded-over end <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, to expose fastener element <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> carried by flap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and flap <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is then folded inwardly over flap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, so that fastener element <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> carried by flap <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> engages with fastener element <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> carried by flap <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to securely hold the folded napkin in its folded condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> A still further embodiment of the present invention that includes flaps, that is foldable into a compact, self-contained package, and that does not require fastener cover strips or release strips is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>. Sanitary napkin <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is structurally similar to the napkin shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> in that it includes a body-facing surface, a garment-facing surface, a fluid-impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> defining the garment-facing surface, an elongated absorbent core <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a fluid-pervious topsheet <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> defining the body-facing surface, and a pair of laterally outwardly extending flaps <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Absorbent core <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be of a thinner overall structure, comparable with commercially-available napkins commonly referred to as &ldquo;mini-pads.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Each of flaps <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> includes a pair of first fastener elements <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> positioned on the body-facing surface of napkin <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in longitudinally spaced relationship. Flaps <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> also include a second fastener element <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> that is positioned between first fastener elements <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. On flap <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> fastener element <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is on the garment-facing side of the flap and on flap <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> fastener element <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is on the body-facing side of the flap. Preferably, fastener elements <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are areas of pressure-sensitive adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> embodiment also includes a third pair of fastener elements <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> positioned in laterally spaced relationship on the garment-facing surface of release strip <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> adjacent first longitudinal end <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and a fourth pair of fastener elements <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> positioned in laterally spaced relationship on the garment-facing surface of the backsheet adjacent second longitudinal end <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of napkin <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Fastener elements <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are also preferably pressure-sensitive adhesive areas. Instead of two individual, laterally spaced adhesive areas as shown, a single, elongated adhesive area having its longitudinal axis extending transversely relative to the napkin longitudinal axis can be provided as an alternative arrangement, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The manipulative steps to fold napkin <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into a compact, self-contained package are similar to those illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 through 28</cross-reference>. Each of ends <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is first individually folded inwardly in the directions indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, respectively, about respective imaginary fold lines <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, so that ends <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, in which each end overlies absorbent core <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, but the ends are not necessarily in overlapped relationship relative to each other. When ends <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are folded over in the manner described, third fastener elements <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and fourth fastener elements <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are exposed and are facing upwardly, in the same direction as the body-facing surface of absorbent core <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Flap <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is then folded inwardly in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, so that it overlies a portion of folded-over ends <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> with fastener element <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> facing upwardly. Similarly, flap <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is then folded inwardly in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, so that it overlies a portion of folded-over ends <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> with fastener element <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> facing upwardly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. When so folded over, first fastener elements <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of each of flaps <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> engage with and releasably adhere to respective third and fourth fastener elements <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and fastener elements <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> engage with each other to retain the folded-over elements in their folded-over positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The resulting folded-over napkin is of a convenient size, in which each of the fastener elements is contained within the folded-over napkin and no fastener elements are exposed. Additionally, the body-facing surface of the absorbent core is completely contained within the folded-over napkin to maintain the cleanliness of the absorbent core before use of the napkin and to substantially cover the absorbent core after use of the napkin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent that the napkin embodiments illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> do not require release liner sheets to cover the flap and end adhesive areas, because when in their completely folded condition each of those embodiments is without outwardly-facing adhesive areas. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In a still further embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, at least one of flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that extends across the flap, and that can be oriented to extend in a direction generally parallel with the longitudinal axis of the napkin. The napkin can have an overall structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, and line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be straight, curved, or it can include both straight and curved components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is a fragmentary view of the outermost surface of the crotch area of a panty <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with a napkin (not shown) in position against the innermost surface at the crotch area. Flaps <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have each been folded over respective edges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the leg openings at the crotch area of the panty and they have been attached to each other by one or more fastener elements <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, only one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. Line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided to facilitate removal of the napkin after use, and without the need by the wearer to disconnect the flaps from each other at fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Removal of the napkin is effected by manually tearing the flap that includes line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which in this instance is flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The tear is made along line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to sever flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to release the flap interconnection that assists in holding the napkin in position relative to the crotch area of the panty, and thereby to facilitate removal of the napkin from the panty without the need to disconnect the flaps from each other at fastener element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is preferably a line that is formed in the material that defines flap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, or flap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, or both, and it enables the user to easily sever the flap in which line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be a score line in the form of a narrow line of reduced flap material thickness that can be impressed into the flap material by heat, by pressure, or by a combination of heat and pressure, so that the flap material can be readily torn along that line without excessive effort. Preferably, line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> retains sufficient structural integrity to maintain as a single piece the flap in which the line of weakness is formed, until severance of that line is desired. As an alternative structural embodiment, line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be a series of spaced, aligned embossments of any suitable shape that together define a series of spaced, thinner, weakened areas in the flap material. As a further alternative, line of weakness <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be defined by a series of aligned, spaced, linear cuts that extend through the flap material, or it can be provided by a series of aligned, non-linear cuts or small apertures, such as perforations, that extend through the flap material and that can be of any desired and effective form. </paragraph>
