<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a disk-like recording medium, a disk recording apparatus and a disk recording method, and a disk playback apparatus and a disk playback method, and particularly to a disk-like recording medium, a disk recording apparatus and a disk recording method, and a disk playback apparatus and a disk playback method that make it possible to reproduce auxiliary information of a disk reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As write-once or rewritable disks are spread, data replication of which is prohibited (for example contents data such as music data and video data protected by copyright or the like) may be illegally copied. On a DVD (Digital Versatile Disk), for example, a BCA (Burst Cutting Area) is provided to prevent illegal copying between disks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The BCA provided on a DVD will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a DVD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (DVD-ROM (Read Only Memory) or DVD-RAM (Random Access Memory)) is irradiated with pulse laser light of a YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser at a factory prior to shipment, whereby stripes (bar code) is formed along the innermost circumference by removing, in a radial direction, narrow stripes of reflecting film made of aluminum or the like formed on an inner side of the disk. The stripes show auxiliary information such for example as an ID number and other identification information and an encryption key. The BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed for about 330&deg; along the innermost circumference of the DVD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Data structure of data recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The data recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a row of five bytes as one unit. A first one byte of the row of five bytes is a sync byte (SB) or a resync (RS). A BCA-Preamble is recorded in four bytes of a first row. The BCA-Preamble is data including only 0s. Four bytes of each row in a BCA data field is an information area or an EDC (error detection code). Four bytes of each row in an ECC (error correction code) area is error correction code. A BCA-Postamble is recorded in a last row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the data recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to be reproduced, a reproducing apparatus generates a clock on the basis of a reproduced signal of the BCA-Preamble part by means of a PLL (Phase Locked Loop), and performs demodulation and error correction by a predetermined method on the basis of the clock to thereby reproduce the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, if the PLL loses synchronism in reproducing the data recorded in the BCA due to some defect, for example, the data cannot be reproduced until the PLL regains synchronism. This means that reproduced data is lost for a period when the synchronism of the PLL is lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also, if a synchronization signal (sync) is lost once due to a defect or the like, data may be lost until a next synchronization signal is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If the amount of lost data is larger than an error correction capability (that is, if there is a local major defect), data cannot be reproduced. The information recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is ID information unique to each disk and the like. It may be related to the entire data on the disk (for example determine whether contents recorded on the DVD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be reproduced or not). Therefore, high reliability is required for data recording and reproduction recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce the amount of lost data, a method of frequently inserting a synchronization signal for resynchronization is conceivable; however, such insertion of the redundant synchronization signal reduces the amount of data recordable in the BCA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, ID information unique to an optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is recorded in a burst cutting area (BCA) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A on the outside (in this case, on the innermost side) of a data area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B within an inner radius of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in which area contents data is recorded. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the burst cutting area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is created in such a manner as to form a continuous circle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example of a disk ID recording format recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the circle is divided into n equal parts (in this case, n&equals;6), thereby forming n blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Each of the blocks is further divided into m frames (in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, m&equals;2). Each of the frames is divided into k parts (in this case, k&equals;234). The ID information is recorded with k channel bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Ten channel bits at the front of each of the frames is frame sync. The succeeding 224 channel bits forms a data area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Here, it is assumed that disk ID information is modulated by a PE (Phase Encode) modulation method, for example. The PE modulation converts one-bit data into two channel bits, and therefore 112 data bits (224 channel bits) can be recorded in a single frame, while 224 information bits (28 bytes) can be recorded in a single block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this example, disk ID information in an ECC format as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is recorded in each of the blocks. In this example, 12-byte parity is added to 16-byte data, and the disk ID information is encoded by a Reed-Solomon code RS (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) of a Galois field GF (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>). Three blocks each have the same ECC format. Thus, 14 bytes of 16-byte ID information ID<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is disposed as information bits of 14 bytes in a first frame of each of the blocks. The remaining two bytes of the ID information ID<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>and 12-byte parity are disposed as information bits of 14 bytes in the next frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> This means triple writing of the same disk ID information in the circle of the disk. This triple writing is in effect equivalent to forming a product code of distance <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the PE modulation is a code indicating a data bit by the position of a mark (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) (bit indicated in black in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and a space (<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) (bit indicated in white in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> data bit of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is converted into channel bits (word) of &ldquo;10&rdquo; and a data bit of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is converted into channel bits (word) of &ldquo;01&rdquo;. In the PE modulation, the channel bits are inverted at a center of two channel bits (center of a word) indicating a data bit. Thus, in the case of data bits, marks or spaces do not occur continuously for three channel bits or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a sync pattern indicating sync bits (frame sync) can be formed by arranging marks or spaces continuously in three channel bits or more. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> each show a sync pattern of frame sync. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, two kinds of sync patterns of six channel bits are provided as frame sync patterns in which marks and spaces each occur continuously in three channel bits. When channel bits of data immediately preceding a frame sync are &ldquo;01&rdquo;, &ldquo;000111&rdquo; is used as the frame sync, and &ldquo;01&rdquo; is added as a succeeding sync pattern. On the other hand, when channel bits of data immediately preceding a frame sync are &ldquo;10&rdquo;, &ldquo;111000&rdquo; is used as the frame sync, and &ldquo;10&rdquo; is added as a succeeding sync pattern. Channel bits of &ldquo;01&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo; are further added as sync ID after the above sync body (&ldquo;00011101&rdquo; or &ldquo;11100010&rdquo;). Thus, a total of 10 channel bits form a frame sync. Hereinafter, a frame sync when a sync ID pattern is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (channel bits&equals;&ldquo;10&rdquo;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>) will be referred to as SA, and a frame sync when a sync ID pattern is &ldquo;1&rdquo; (channel bits&equals;&ldquo;01&rdquo;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>) will be referred to as SB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A frame sync SA is used to indicate that its frame is a first frame of a block, whereas a frame sync SB is used to indicate that its frame is other than a first frame of each of the blocks. Hence, the number of frames having frame syncs SA is equal to the number of blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to which the present invention is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A register <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> stores the disk ID information that has been subjected to error correction coding in accordance with the ECC format shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> reads the disk ID information stored in the register <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, subjects the disk ID information to PE modulation, and then outputs the result to a laser <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> subjects the disk ID information read from the register <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the PE modulation according to a clock (channel clock) inputted from a VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and then inserts sync patterns to thereby generate data to be recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The laser <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is a YAG laser, for example, and irradiates the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with a high-power laser beam via a mirror <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and an object lens <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The object lens <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a cylindrical lens, for example, and irradiates the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with the laser beam entering the object lens <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, a reflecting film of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is changed irreversibly, whereby the disk ID information is recorded as a bar code. That is, even if the optical disk is a rewritable recording medium, the auxiliary data such as disk ID recorded in the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is recorded on the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as unrewritable data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> rotates the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> under control of a spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and an FG (Frequency Generator) signal generator not shown in the figure provided within the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> generates an FG signal that forms one pulse each time the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) rotates by a predetermined angle, and then outputs the FG signal to the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Under control of a controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on the basis of the FG signal inputted from the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> rotates at a predetermined rotational speed. Also, the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> outputs the FG signal inputted from the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a PC (Phase Comparator) <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In addition, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> generates a control signal for controlling a frequency dividing ratio of a frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the basis of the FG signal inputted from the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the control signal to the frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> divides the clock outputted by the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into a value 1/N (frequency dividing ratio) set on the basis of the control signal inputted from the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the result to the PC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The PC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> compares the phase of a clock inputted from the frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the phase of the FG signal inputted from the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to thereby generate a phase difference signal, and then outputs the phase difference signal to the LPF <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The LPF <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> removes a high-frequency component from the signal inputted thereto, and then outputs the result to the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> changes the phase (frequency) of the clock that the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> outputs by oscillation on the basis of a voltage applied to a control terminal of the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (that is, the output from the LPF <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The clock outputted by the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is inputted to the PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and also to the frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>.

Therefore, the output of the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a signal oscillating in sync with the FG signal at a frequency N times that of the FG signal. The PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> outputs the data in the format described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> according to the clock inputted from the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to the laser <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

When a command to start recording is issued, the controller <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> controls the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to rotate the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> at a predetermined speed. The spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> generates an FG signal corresponding to its rotation, and then supplies the FG signal to the spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The spindle servo control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> supplies the FG signal to the PC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The PC <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> compares the phases of two input signals with each other, and then supplies a signal of a phase error between the two signals to the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> via the LPF <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> generates a clock having a phase and a frequency corresponding to a signal (control voltage) supplied from the LPF <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, the clock (channel clock) outputted by the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a cycle of 1/(n&times;m&times;k) of one rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). For example, when an FG wave number per rotation of the FG signal is <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the value of the frequency dividing ratio 1/N of the frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is 1/39, the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> generates a channel clock having a cycle of 1/(3&times;2&times;234) of the time period of one rotation of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> subjects disk ID information supplied from the register <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to PE modulation based on the channel clock supplied from the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and then outputs the disk ID information to the laser <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, depending on output intensity required by the laser <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the cycle of the channel clock outputted by the VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be multiplied by r to be r/(n&times;m&times;k).

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The encryption processing unit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> encrypts contents data inputted from an apparatus not shown in the figure on the basis of the disk ID information stored in the register <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the contents data to the ECC unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The ECC unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> adds an error correction code to the contents data inputted from the encryption processing unit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the resulting contents data to the modulation unit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The modulation unit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> modulates the contents data inputted from the ECC unit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by the PE method or another predetermined modulation method, and then outputs the resulting contents data to the optical pickup <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The optical pickup <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> records the contents-data inputted from the modulation unit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in the data area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When a command to reproduce the contents data thus recorded is issued, the CPU <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> controls the servo control unit <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to rotate the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the CLV method as in the case as described above. The optical pickup <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> plays back the data area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the reproduced data to the matrix amplifier <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The matrix amplifier <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> supplies the reproduced data to the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The demodulation unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> demodulates the reproduced contents data inputted thereto by a demodulation method corresponding to the modulation method of the modulation unit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the resulting data to the ECC unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The ECC unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> subjects the demodulated data inputted from the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to error correction processing, and then supplies the resulting data to the decryption processing unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The decryption processing unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> decrypts the contents data (encrypted contents data) inputted from the ECC unit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> on the basis of the disk ID information inputted from the register <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the result to an apparatus not shown in the figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As described above, encrypted contents data is recorded in the data area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the encrypted contents data is copied onto other disks as it is by a computer or the like, it is not possible to copy the disk ID information, thereby preventing decryption of the contents data. Thus, it is possible to practically control illegal copying of contents data in large quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The channel position correction made by the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10E</cross-reference>. In this case, description will be made assuming that p&equals;3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A reproduced pit waveform (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>) outputted from the LPF <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is binarized by the comparator <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and then inputted to the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as a binarized pit signal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>) The demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes counters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (not shown). The counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference>) counts the number of clocks (<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to p-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) within a channel bit. The counter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</cross-reference>) counts the number of two channel bits of the PE modulation. The counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</cross-reference>) counts the number of bits (words) of the PE modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The channel position correction is made by utilizing the fact that in the PE modulation, bits are invariably inverted at a center of a pit (that is, center of a word &ldquo;10&rdquo; or &ldquo;01&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Specifically, in timing A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B through 10E</cross-reference>, even though the value of the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is not changed (even though at a center of a pit), level of the binarized pit signal is inverted, and therefore the value of the counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> immediately after the timing A is corrected to be &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Also, the channel position correction is made by utilizing the fact that when the same data bits occur continuously, channel bits are inverted at a point between the data bits (between the words). Specifically, in timing B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B through 10E</cross-reference>, when the value of the counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is changed (at a point between words), the level of the binarized pit signal is inverted, and thus the values of the counters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are corrected to be &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A plurality of frame syncs are arranged at equal intervals for one rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Therefore, frame syncs are endlessly generated in a constant cycle as the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is rotated. Hence, even when a frame sync of a frame is not detected, it is possible to reproduce data succeeding the frame sync without loss of the data on the basis of interpolating timing of a frame sync previously detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when a frame sync (&ldquo;00011101XX&rdquo; or &ldquo;11100010XX&rdquo;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>) is detected, the values of the counters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are all initialized to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The ECC unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is supplied with the demodulated data (that is, the disk ID information including parity written triply as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and then subjects the data to error correction processing. Each piece of the triply written disk ID information is subjected to error correction. When a result of error correction of a third block is different from results of error correction of the other two blocks (a first and a second block), for example, the results of error correction of the first block and the second block are used as the disk ID information under a majority rule. The ECC unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> outputs the error-corrected disk ID information to the register <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The ECC unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also determine correct words in each of the blocks by majority and then perform error correction processing on a code generated by collecting correct words. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> For example, when a first word in the first block coincides with a first word in the second block and a first word in the third block is different from the first words in the first block and the second block, the first word in the first block (or the second block) is used as a correct word. When a second word in the second block coincides with a second word in the third block and a second word in the first block is different from the second words in the second block and the third block, the second word in the second block (or the third block) is used as a correct word. Other correct words are collected in a similar manner on the basis of the majority rule to reconstruct a single piece of disk ID information. Then the disk ID information is subjected to error correction processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that disk ID is reproduced without using a tracking servo, as described above. Therefore, when the reproducing operation is repeatedly performed over a plurality of rotations of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a different reproduction result (reproduced data) may be obtained because of a slightly shifted radial tracking position or the like. Accordingly, the reproducing operation or correcting operation can be performed over a plurality of rotations of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As a second embodiment, modulation of disk ID information using a 4-1 modulation for recording will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a disk ID recording format in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Also in this case, as in the first embodiment, the circle of the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is divided into three equal parts, thereby forming three blocks. Each of the blocks is formed by two frames each having a sync block SA or SB at the front. Each of the frames has a frame sync of <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> channel bits, and its information bits are 112 data bits. The 4-1 modulation converts data of 112 bits into 392 channel bits, and therefore the number of channel bits of a single frame is 406 (hence, n&equals;3, m&equals;2, and k&equals;406). Disk ID information of 224 bits, that is, 28 bytes can be recorded in a single block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the 4-1 modulation is a modulation method that modulates two data bits into seven channel bits. First three channel bits form a sync pattern-denoted by &ldquo;010&rdquo;, and succeeding four channel bits form a data portion, which indicates data by a position of &ldquo;1&rdquo; within the four channel bits. When two data bits before the modulation are &ldquo;00&rdquo;, the data portion is &ldquo;1000&rdquo;; when two data bits before the modulation are &ldquo;01&rdquo;, the data portion is &ldquo;0100&rdquo;; when two data bits before the modulation are &ldquo;10&rdquo;, the data portion is &ldquo;0010&rdquo;; when two data bits before the modulation are &ldquo;11&rdquo;, the data portion is &ldquo;0001&rdquo;. One word is formed by the combined seven channel bits of the sync pattern and the data portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the PE modulation method used in the first embodiment, equal numbers of logical &ldquo;0s&rdquo; and logical &ldquo;1s&rdquo; appear. Accordingly, in that case, substantially half of the reflecting film in the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is removed. On the other hand, in the 4-1 modulation, a ratio of logical &ldquo;0s&rdquo; to logical &ldquo;1s&rdquo; is 5:2. Accordingly, the amount of reflected light is larger than when disk ID information is recorded by the PE modulation. Thus, the 4-1 modulation has an advantage of making it easier to effect servo control such as focus control during the reading of data, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Also in this example, the ECC format of the disk ID information is the same as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The disk ID information is encoded by an RS (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) code of GF (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>), and 12-byte parity is added to form one block. The same block is written triply around the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> each show a sync pattern of a frame sync in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the 4-1 modulation, the position of a logical &ldquo;1&rdquo; is fixed in a sync pattern of three channel bits. Therefore, when attention is directed to the logical &ldquo;1s&rdquo; of sync patterns occurring after every other logical &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the logical &ldquo;1s&rdquo; of sync patterns invariably have an interval of &ldquo;7&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Thus, a sync pattern can be formed by breaking the regularity of the interval at which every other logical &ldquo;1&rdquo; occurs. A sync pattern &ldquo;101000010010100&rdquo; where the intervals at which every other logical &ldquo;1&rdquo; occurs are &ldquo;8, 5, and 6&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> is set as a first sync pattern SA. A sync pattern &ldquo;01000101001000&rdquo; where the intervals at which every other logical &ldquo;1&rdquo; occurs are &ldquo;6, 5, and 8&rdquo; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> is set as a second sync pattern SB. Thus, in the second embodiment, a frame sync of 14 channel bits is inserted into the disk ID recording format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for recording the disk ID according to the second embodiment. Parts corresponding to those of the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are identified by the same reference numerals, and their description will be omitted where appropriate (the same will apply hereinafter) Specifically, the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> has the same configuration as that of the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> except that the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is provided with a 4-1 modulation unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in place of the PE modulation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Therefore, operation of the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is the same as that of the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> except the modulation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> When the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> records the disk ID recording format as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> on the circle of the BCA <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of an optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a PLL may be operated such that one rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is in synchronism with n&times;m&times;k of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. For example, when the wave number of an FG signal outputted from a spindle motor <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and then a frequency dividing coefficient N of a frequency divider <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is set at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the cycle of a channel clock outputted from a VCO <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> becomes equal to 1/(3&times;2&times;406) of one rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The configuration of a disk recording and playback apparatus <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for recording data and reproducing data recorded in a data area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> having the disk ID information recorded by the disk ID recording apparatus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the 4-1 modulation method is basically the same as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. However, processing of a demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the disk recording-and playback apparatus <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is different from that of the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Channel position correction made by the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16G</cross-reference>. Also in this case, as in the first embodiment, description will be made assuming that p&equals;3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A reproduced pit waveform (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>) outputted from an LPF <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is binarized by a comparator <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and then inputted to the demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as a binarized pit signal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference>). The demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> delays the binarized pit signal inputted thereto by a certain time and generates a pit center signal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</cross-reference>) that rises precisely at a center of a period in which the binarized pit signal is a logical &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The demodulation unit <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes a window generator for generating a window for counters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and sync pattern detection (that is, a window for reading a binarized signal of a reproduced pit when the value of the counter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;2&rdquo;) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference>). The counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</cross-reference>) counts the number of clocks (<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to p-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) within a channel bit. The counter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</cross-reference>) counts the seven channel bits of the 4-1 modulation. The counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16G</cross-reference>) counts the number of words of the 4-1 modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The channel position correction is made so that the value of the counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes &ldquo;1&rdquo; when a pit center (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</cross-reference>) is detected. For example, the value of the counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is corrected to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; in timing C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</cross-reference> in which a pit center is detected. In addition, word position correction is made so that a pit center (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</cross-reference>) of a sync pattern is located at the center of a window (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference>). For example, the values of the counter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the counter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are corrected to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; in timing D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A plurality of frame syncs are arranged at equal intervals for one rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even when a frame sync of a frame is not detected, it is possible to reproduce data succeeding the frame sync without loss of the data on the basis of interpolating timing of a frame sync previously detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, when a frame sync (&ldquo;01000010010100&rdquo; or &ldquo;01000101001000&rdquo;) described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> is detected, the values of the counters <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are initialized to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Description will next be made of a case, as a third embodiment, in which the ECC format of disk ID information recorded in the register <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is encoded by an RS (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) code of GF (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, </cross-reference>16-byte parity is added to form one block, and the same block is subjected to 4-1 modulation and then written triply around the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference>, a sync pattern of a frame sync is formed by adding one word as sync ID to each of the sync patterns SA and SB described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference>. A sync pattern of a frame sync thus has a total of <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> channel bits. Hence, the sync ID makes it possible to represent four kinds of sync patterns by using each of the sync patterns SA and SB and thus form a total of eight sync patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, it is possible to divide one block into eight frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In this case, n&equals;3 and m&equals;8. Data of 32 bits is disposed in one frame. The data is converted into 112 channel bits by 4-1 modulation, and therefore the value of k is 133 channel bits (&equals;21&plus;112). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The optical disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is for example a CD (Compact Disk), an MD (Mini-Disk), a DVD (Digital Versatile Disk) or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The series of processing steps described above may also be carried out by software. The software is installed from a recording medium onto a computer where programs forming the software are incorporated in dedicated hardware, or a general-purpose personal computer, for example, which can perform various functions by installing various programs thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Examples of the recording medium include program-recorded package media distributed to users to provide a program separately from computers, such as the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> (including floppy disks), the optical disks <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> (including CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only Memory) and DVD (Digital Versatile Disk)), the magneto-optical disks <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> (including MD (Mini-Disk)), or the semiconductor memories <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As described above, the disk-like recording medium according to the present invention comprises: n blocks arranged by dividing a circle of a second area into n equal parts; and m frames arranged by dividing each of the blocks into m equal parts; wherein auxiliary information is arranged in the frames in such a manner as to be at equal intervals in a circumferential direction, and a synchronization signal is disposed in each of the frames. Therefore, it is possible to realize a disk allowing the auxiliary information to be read easily and reliably without using a PLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The disk recording apparatus and the disk recording method according to the present invention form n blocks by dividing a second area of a disk into n equal parts in a circumferential direction, form m frames by dividing each of the blocks into m equal parts in the circumferential direction, generate channel clocks by dividing each of the frames into k equal parts, control rotation of the disk so that one rotation of the disk is in synchronism with a cycle of n&times;m&times;k channel clocks, modulate auxiliary information on the basis of the channel clocks, and then record the auxiliary information on the disk. Therefore, it is possible to realize a disk allowing the auxiliary information to be reproduced easily and reliably without using a PLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The disk playback apparatus and the disk playback method according to the present invention sample a reproduced signal from a disk by a clock having a frequency twice n&times;m&times;k or higher, and demodulate channel bits, or words while correcting the channel bits, or the words. Therefore, it is possible to reproduce auxiliary information easily and reliably without using a PLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In each of the above cases, when a plurality of blocks are provided and auxiliary information is written multiply, it is possible to equivalently form a product code and thus realize a high correction capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Since the circle of the disk is in a substantially physically uniform state, it is possible to reduce effects on a focus servo and the like and to control deterioration of the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Even if a defect is caused on the disk, it is possible to correct channel bits, or words. It is therefore possible to achieve high reliability in reproducing auxiliary information. Also, the redundancy of a synchronization signal may be at a low level. </paragraph>
