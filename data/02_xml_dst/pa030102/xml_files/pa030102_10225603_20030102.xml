<heading lvl="1">THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and system for controlling the thrust of a watercraft during various steering conditions, and more particularly to a method and system for controlling the thrust of a watercraft of the jet propulsion type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One type of watercraft is the jet-propelled type that is designed to be operated by a rider seated on the watercraft in a straddle-like fashion. This type of watercraft is propelled by discharging water out of a discharge nozzle located at the rear of the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To provide steering for the watercraft, a steering nozzle is pivotably connected to the end of the discharge nozzle. The input for the pivot of the steering nozzle is provided by a steering handle pivotably mounted on the top of the watercraft. To steer the watercraft to the right, the rider turns the steering handle clockwise causing the steering nozzle to pivot counter-clockwise. The discharge of water out of the steering nozzle with the nozzle pivoted counter-clockwise causes the watercraft to yaw clockwise and turn to the right. A similar but opposite sequence is used to steer the watercraft to the left. Therefore, for a watercraft of the jet propulsion type to steer properly, a sufficient amount of thrust out of the steering nozzle is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The thrust of the watercraft is controlled by the rider through the use of a thumb operated throttle lever pivotably mounted on the steering handle. The throttle lever is biased toward an idle position. To increase thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle, the rider presses down on the throttle lever with his thumb. This pivots the throttle lever toward the wide-open throttle position. To decrease thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle, the rider releases the throttle lever. Since the throttle lever is biased toward the idle position, without a force countering the bias, the throttle lever pivots toward the idle position. As the throttle lever pivots toward the idle position, the thrust of water out of the discharge decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While the decrease in thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle is desirable for slowing down the watercraft, the decrease in thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle also decreases the steering capability of the watercraft since the thrust provides the steering for the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This quick decrease in steering capability is particularly problematic in situations in which an inexperienced rider attempts to avoid an obstacle directly in front of the watercraft. To properly avoid the obstacle, the rider should apply a constant pressure on the throttle lever while simultaneously turning the steering handle. However, an inexperienced rider may release the throttle lever to slow the watercraft quickly while simultaneously turning the steering handle in an attempt to maneuver around the obstacle. In such a situation, the rider may not be able to maneuver around the obstacle since steering capability has been decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This decrease in steering capability is also problematic for the rider to maneuver the watercraft for docking the watercraft. Since the docking procedure usually occurs with the watercraft traveling at a low speed, the rider may release the throttle lever while attempting to dock the watercraft. However, with only idle thrust provided to steer the watercraft, steering capability may not be adequate to dock the watercraft. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance to the present invention. The watercraft comprises a hull <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that has a bow portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is pivotably mounted to the rear of the bow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is part of a steering mechanism for steering the watercraft. The steering mechanism includes the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in which the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fixed to the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> such that the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> pivots the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is powered by an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is contained beneath the bow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and which drives a jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is disposed centrally of the hull and beneath the seat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The jet propulsion unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an impeller <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which draws water from a water inlet (not shown) and discharges the water through a discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is supported for pivotal movement about a generally vertical extending axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to the discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for steering the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By pivoting the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> about the vertical extending axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a turning force is created on the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is mechanically linked through a steering cable <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that a rotational movement of the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will cause a pivotal movement of the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For the rider to turn the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> toward the right R, the rider would rotate the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> clockwise W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The clockwise rotation W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> causes the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pivot counter-clockwise W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The thrust of water out of the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivoted counter-clockwise W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>causes the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to yaw clockwise W<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, thus pivoting the front of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the right R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Similarly for the rider to turn the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> toward the left L, the rider would rotate the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> counter-clockwise W<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The counter-clockwise W<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>rotation of the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> causes the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pivot clockwise W<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. The thrust of water out of the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the steering nozzle pivoted clockwise W<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>causes the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to yaw counter-clockwise W<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>thus pointing the front of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the left L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Hence, the turning capability for this type of watercraft is created from the yaw of the watercraft caused by the thrust of water out the steering nozzle with the steering nozzle pivoted toward at a certain direction. The amount of yaw is a function of both the pivot of the steering nozzle and the thrust of the water out of the steering nozzle. Therefore, even if the steering nozzle is pivoted, without sufficient thrust of water out of the steering nozzle, the watercraft is not able to yaw and turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the rider controls the thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle through the use of a throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> pivotably mounted to throttle lever bracket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> attached to the circumferentially outer surface of the right portion of the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adjacent to a right handle grip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the throttle lever bracket <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are mounted to the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the pivot end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> axially away from the right hand grip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the lever end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> axially toward the right hand grip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The right handle grip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are designed such that the rider&apos;s palm and four fingers rest on the hand grip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the rider&apos;s thumb is positioned over the lever end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is mechanically linked through a throttle cable <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to a throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The throttle regulator can be a carburetor for a carbureted internal combustion engine or a throttle body for a fuel injected internal combustion engine. As illustrated in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the end of the throttle cable <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is attached to a throttle control pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is attached to a throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> which regulates the amount of fuel and air provided to the combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A throttle return spring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is attached to the throttle control pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to bias the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> toward an idle position. Since the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is mechanically linked to the throttle control pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the throttle regulator, the throttle return spring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> likewise biases the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward an idle position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To increase the thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the rider would press down on the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with his right thumb. This downward force counters the bias by the throttle return spring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pivots the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> away from the idle position W<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>toward a wide open throttle position W<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>The rider can vary the amount of thrust out of the discharge nozzle by varying the amount of force applied on the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The more force applied on the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the more the throttle lever pivots from the idle position W<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>toward the wide open throttle position W<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and pulls the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the throttle regulator toward the wide open throttle position W<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To reduce the thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the rider would apply a pressure on the throttle lever less than the bias caused by the throttle return spring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. This allows the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to pivot toward the idle position W<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>and, likewise, the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the throttle regulator toward the idle position W<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>. The quickest way to reduce the thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is for the rider to totally release the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thus allowing the throttle return spring <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to quickly bias the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the throttle regulator toward the idle positions W<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>and W<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> However, by quickly reducing the thrust of the water out of the discharge nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by totally releasing the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also quickly reduces the ability for the rider to steer the watercraft. As discussed earlier, steering of the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is caused by a thrust of water out of the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the steering nozzle pivoted toward one direction, thus creating a yaw to the watercraft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As the amount of thrust is decreased, the amount of yaw is also decreased. This is particularly problematic when an inexperienced rider seeks to avoid hitting an obstacle directly in front of the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To avoid the obstacle directly in front of the watercraft, the rider should turn the steering handle toward one direction while simultaneously applying pressure on the throttle lever. This procedure provides sufficient thrust out of the steering nozzle for creating an adequate yaw of the watercraft to steer clear of the obstacle. However, an inexperienced rider may panic and quickly release the throttle lever to reduce the thrust of water out of the discharge nozzle. While the velocity of the watercraft is reduced, the reduction of thrust of water out of the steering nozzle also reduces the yaw of the watercraft, therefore reducing the steering capability of the watercraft. Without adequate steering capability, the momentum of the watercraft could force the watercraft into the obstacle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic of a first embodiment of the present invention. The present invention includes a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for controlling the thrust of a watercraft during various steering conditions with inputs provided by the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for controlling the thrust is attached to the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide the watercraft with adequate steering capability even if the rider releases the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for controlling the thrust of the fifth embodiment comprises a throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a steering position sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a servomotor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a microprocessor based controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located at the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at either the throttle control pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and sends a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> providing the throttle position. While the preferred embodiment illustrates the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> located at the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be located anywhere from the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a proximity switch triggering mechanism. The proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is mounted on a bracket located near the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the watercraft. Two magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> acting as proximity-triggering mechanisms are mounted on the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> are mounted on the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> such that the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is located at the circumferential center of the two magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> when the position of the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> causes the watercraft to travel in a straight direction. In other words, when the watercraft is traveling in a straight direction, the angle W<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>between the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with one of the magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to the angle W<highlight><subscript>14 </subscript></highlight>between the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with the other magnet <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Once the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is at a given trigger angular position P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is sufficiently close to one of the magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to send a signal to the controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, after the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives inputs from the throttle sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that the throttle is sufficiently closed as to be unable to provide adequate steering thrust, and from the steering sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been sufficiently turned, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> sends a series of signals to the servomotor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in accordance with programmed throttle positions during a given time sequence. The servomotor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> turns the throttle pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> toward the wide open throttle position W<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>and opens the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> toward the wide open throttle position W<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>in accordance to the programmed throttle position during the given time sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The programmed throttle positions during the given time sequence vary between watercrafts having different hull <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> designs. The programmed throttle positions during a given time sequence also vary between watercrafts having different desired performance outcomes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> are exemplars of such programmed throttle positions during a given time sequence. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates that upon the throttle released and the steering handle sufficiently turned at time t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the throttle increases quickly to a throttle T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>above idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and then decreasing slowly to the idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The programmed throttle positions during a given time sequence (t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, are ideal for a watercraft needing quick response such as performance oriented watercraft. This is also ideal for a watercraft less responsive to throttle, such as having a shallow hull, a long hull or a low pressured steering nozzle design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates that upon the throttle released and the steering handle sufficiently turned at time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the throttle increases slowly to a throttle T<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>above idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and then decreasing slowly to the idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The programmed throttle positions during a given time sequence (t<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, are ideal for a watercraft used for riders wanting a smooth and gradual thrust response. This is also ideal for a watercraft very responsive to throttle input such as having a deep hull, a short hull or a high-pressure steering nozzle design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can also be programmed to send a signal to the servomotor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> upon the throttle released and the steering handle sufficiently turned at time t<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>to increase throttle to a first throttle T<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>above idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and the decrease to a lower throttle T<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>above idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. Thereafter, the throttle remains at the lower throttle T<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>above idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>until the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been turned sufficiently toward the straight-ahead position at time t<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, such that the steering position no longer surpasses steering position P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, thereafter the throttle decreases to the idle throttle T<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. This program allows the watercraft to turn quickly upon the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> first being turned and thereafter remains at a smoother turn until the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been turned sufficiently toward the straight-ahead pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In short, a programmed controller of the first embodiment allows for variable throttle over a given time period upon certain required inputs sent by the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a schematic of a second embodiment of the present invention. The present invention includes a system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for controlling the thrust of a watercraft during various steering conditions with inputs provided by the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The system for controlling the thrust is attached to the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide the watercraft with adequate steering capability even if the rider releases the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for controlling the thrust of the second embodiment comprises a throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a steering position sensor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, a hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, an engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, a servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and a microprocessor-based controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is located at the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at either the throttle control pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and sends a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> providing the throttle position. While the preferred embodiment illustrates the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> located at the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be located anywhere from the throttle lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> comprises a proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a proximity switch triggering mechanism. The proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is mounted on a bracket located near the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the watercraft. Two magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> acting as proximity-triggering mechanisms are mounted on the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> are mounted on the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> such that the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is located at the circumferential center of the two magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> when the position of the steering post <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> causes the watercraft to travel in a straight direction. In other words, when the watercraft is traveling in a straight direction the angle W<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>between the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with one of the magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to the angle W<highlight><subscript>14 </subscript></highlight>between the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with the other magnet <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Once the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is at a given trigger angular position P<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the proximity switch <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is sufficiently close to one of the magnets <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to send a signal to the controller that the steering handle is sufficiently turned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> can be a paddle wheel or a pitot tube. A paddle wheel is preferred since greater accuracy can be obtained by a paddle wheel. The hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> can be located anywhere along the submerged portion of the hull <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> sends a signal to the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> providing the speed of the hull relative to the surrounding water. The engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> can be the same sensor which normally sends a signal to the tachometer informing the rider of the engine speed. In addition to sending a signal to the tachometer, the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> also sends a signal to the controller providing the engine speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> receives inputs from the throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that the throttle is sufficiently closed as to be unable to provide adequate steering, and from the steering position sensor <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been sufficiently turned, with input of the hull speed received from the hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and input of the engine speed received from the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> calculates a throttle position that the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> should operate to obtain the desired water thrust out of the steering nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the calculated throttle position is a function of the hull speed and the engine speed. The formula for calculating the throttle position would vary from one watercraft to another. Examples of such variations between the watercraft include the length of the watercraft, the width of the watercraft, the hull depth of the watercraft and the desired performance of the watercraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With the programmed formula for calculating the throttle position, the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> continuously calculates the throttle position using inputs from the hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> then sends a signal to the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in accordance with the calculated throttle position. The servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> turns the throttle pulley <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and opens the throttle plate <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in accordance to the calculated throttle position. The controller <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> continuously calculates a new throttle position using inputs from the hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> so long as the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is sufficiently turned and the throttle position is less that what is required to produce a steerable thrust. The time period between each calculation is dictated by the type of controller used. It is desirable to have small time periods between each calculation. However, a faster and more costly controller is required. Therefore, the time period between each calculation would depend on the cost effectiveness of the controller at the time the watercraft is designed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the present invention calculates the throttle position based on the hull speed and the engine speed, it is not necessary that both the hull speed and the engine speed must be inputs for the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to operate. For example, the hull speed sensor <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> can be eliminated from the present invention and a constant value can be used in the formula for calculating the throttle position in place of a varying hull speed. Likewise, the engine speed sensor <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> can be eliminated from the present invention and a constant value can be used in the formula for calculating the throttle position in place of a varying engine speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The controllers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the first and second embodiments also allow for several backup features to be designed into the throttle system. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>, a back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is located between the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> senses the signal from the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Should the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> fail to send a signal to the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> causes the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to actuate the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to an idle position W<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>. Therefore, should the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> malfunction, or the power source to the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> fail, the back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> automatically returns the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the idle position W<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>from the throttle position of the throttle regulator when the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> fails to send a signal to the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Another backup feature of the second embodiment is an acceleration prevention system <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. For some non-performance oriented watercrafts, acceleration during turning is undesirable since acceleration during turning may cause the rider to over-steer the watercraft. The controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the present invention, with the acceleration prevention feature <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, checks the current hull speed of the watercraft against an average of the previous hull speed of the watercraft. Should the current hull speed be greater than the average of the previous hull speed, the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> causes the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to reduce the water thrust out of the steering nozzle until the current hull speed is no longer greater than the average of the previous hull speed. Should the current hull speed fail to be reduced, such that the current hull speed is no longer greater than the average of the previous hull speed after a given amount of time, the back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is activated to return the throttle regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to idle throttle W<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>. Should the back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> also fail to reduce the current hull speed such that the current hull speed is no longer greater than the average of the previous hull after a given amount of time, an engine kill switch <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is activated to stop the engine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As further diagramed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>, additional features can be provided to the system for controlling the thrust of the watercraft. These additional features include a poor steering lite <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, a steer active lite <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a fail lite <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Upon the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> determining the steering handle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been sufficiently turned and the throttle position below a position that would provide adequate steering thrust, the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> sends power to the poor steering conditions lite <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to inform the rider that the watercraft is experiencing poor steering condition. During the time period the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> activates the servomotor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> sends power to the steering active lite <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to inform the rider that the system for controlling thrust has been activated. Should the back-up throttle return system <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> be activated due to the controller&apos;s failure to send a signal to the servomotor, or the watercraft continuing to accelerate during the turn after a given amount of time, the controller <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> sends power to the fail lite <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to inform the rider that the off-throttle steering system has failed to operate properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flow diagram showing an exemplar programming for the controller <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in accordance with the second embodiment. </paragraph>
