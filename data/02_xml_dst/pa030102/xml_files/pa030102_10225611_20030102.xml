<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In many different industries, most notably, the airline catering industry, food products must be transferred from one area to another after preparation and before service. Food products after preparation are generally hot, for example, 170&deg; F. The food products are then placed on trays which, in turn, are placed on a movable rack. The rack is then usually placed within a cabinet cooler, to reduce the temperature of the food products to a desired temperature of, for example, 40&deg; F. Thereafter, the rack can be removed from the cabinet cooler and moved into a conventional walk-in cooler for the final reduction in temperature of the food products to a temperature of, for example, 38&deg; F. When the user is ready to process the food products, the rack is removed from the walk-in cooler for final processing of the food products by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Problems have arisen, though, with the movement of the food products after preparation, to the walk-in cooler, and then to their final destination, i.e., airline carts. The food products will not maintain the desired temperature as they must be moved from place to place outside of a controlled environment of the desired temperature. Generally, the cabinet cooler is stationary and is connected to an intricate plumbing system, or requires the use of liquid nitrogen or liquid CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. These cabinet coolers also generally require the user to push the rack onto a ramp in order to insert the rack within the cabinet cooler. Such a setup can cause safety problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for an effective cabinet cooler that is portable such that it can move by itself, or in conjunction with a rack holding food products therein. There is also a need for an effective cabinet cooler that is capable of sealing cooled air therein when the rack is positioned therein. The present invention provides such a cabinet cooler. Other advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the attached specification in combination with a study of the drawings. </paragraph>

The cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is used to reduce the temperature of the food products or the like to a desired temperature of, for example, 40&deg; F. Thereafter, the rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is removed from the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and moved into a conventional walk-in cooler (not shown) for the final reduction in temperature of the food products or the like to a temperature of, for example, 38&deg; F. When the user is ready to process the food products or the like, the rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is removed from the walk-in cooler for final processing of the food products or the like by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After final processing, the rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be reinserted into the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be directly wheeled to the airline carts. The rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the trays or just the trays can then be removed from the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for transferring the trays to the airline cart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention can also be used as a thermal box. The empty rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be placed within the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Trays with food products or the like are then mounted onto the support members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>while the rack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is within the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Preferably, for this type of application, vinyl strips are used to close the front of the housing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> so that the user does not have to constantly open and close the door <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention is used to prevent the temperature of the food products or the like from rising during the time the trays are being prepared and can be used to remove heat from the food products or the like in an efficient manner. In addition, the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention is not intended to freeze the food products or the like. Usage of the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention as an intermediate step also reduces condensation within the walk-in cooler and reduces the amount of dehydration of the food products or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention does not require a carbon dioxide tank, does not require a nitrogen tank and does not require plumbing which would be associated with these tanks or any other mechanical apparatus using cooling or freezing. In addition, the cabinet cooler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the present invention is portable making the cabinet cooler very convenient to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the foregoing description. </paragraph>
