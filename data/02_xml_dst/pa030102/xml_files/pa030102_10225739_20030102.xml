<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to human spinal surgery and, in particular, to methods and apparatus associated with annulus fibrosis augmentation, and partial and full disc replacement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> According to human anatomy, spinal function is dependent upon the intervertebral disc and the facet joints. In a sense, the annulus fibrosis, nucleus pulpous, and the facet joints form the legs of a three-legged stool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The annulus is formed of 10 to 60 fibrous bands which serve to control vertebral motion. One half of the bands tighten to check motion when the vertebra above or below the disc are turned in either direction. Restoring disc height returns tension to the annular noted in the prosthetic disc patent application. In addition, restoring annular tension decreases annular protrusion into the spinal canal or neural foramen. Thus, decreasing annular protrusion may eliminate pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> At times the rotational, translational, and axial compression forces exceed the strength of the annular fibers. The excessive forces tear the annular fibers. A single event can tear one band to all the bands. Subsequent tears can connect to previous tears of a few bands resulting in a hole through the entire annulus fibrosis. Holes through the entire annulus fibrosis can result in extrusion of the nucleus pulpous. Extrusion of the nucleus pulpous is referred to as a &ldquo;herniated disc.&rdquo; Disc herniation can result in back pan, neck pain, arm pain, leg pain, nerve or spinal cord injury, or a combination of the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since the annulus is innervated with pain fibers, acute annular tears without herniation of the nucleus can be painful. Unfortunately, the annular tears often do not heal completely. The chronic tears can result in neck pain, back pain, shoulder pain, buttock pain, or thigh pain. The chronic tears weaken the annulus fibrosis predisposing the disc to herniation or additional annular tears. My U.S. Pat. No. 6,340,369, entitled &ldquo;Methods and Apparatus for Treating Disc Herniation,&rdquo; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,704, entitled &ldquo;Artificial Intervertebral Disc Replacement&rdquo; describe methods and apparatus for occluding annular defects. These patents, incorporated herein by reference, also discuss spinal anatomy, spinal physiology, disc degeneration, surgical and non-surgical treatments of disc disease, and the advantages of prosthetic disc replacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To restore disc height resulting, for example, from degenerative disease, prosthetic discs are used to replace only the nucleus pulpous. However, prosthetic replacement of the nucleus pulpous alone risks future problems arising from annular tears. Patients may continue to complain of pain from the stresses placed onto the weakened annulus. Secondly, tears of the annulus could result in extrusion of the prosthetic nucleus. In addition, remaining nucleus pulpous could herniate through annular tears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Some prosthetic disc designs attempt to replace nucleus and annular functions. In general, these designs attach the prosthetic disc to the vertebrae. Many of the techniques in this area attach the prosthetic disc to the end plates of the vertebrae with screws, spikes, flanges, or porous surfaces for bone ingrowth. My U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,245,107 and 6,419,704 describe methods and devices to assist the annulus in retaining remaining nucleus pulpous and a prosthetic nucleus. The entire contents of these applications are also incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The need remains, however, for a more biologically compatible disc/annulus augmentation technique. Ideally, such an improved technique would aid with ingrowth while, at the same time, replace augmented tissue. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This invention broadly resides in devices to augment and/or fortify a human disc using human or animal tissue. In the preferred embodiments, a bag, sealed body, or the like, is fashioned from fascia, skin, or other applicable tissue from a living or recently deceased human or animal donor, and used to supplement the annulus fibrosis or partially or entirely replace a disc. Such devices may aid the ingrowth of the patient&apos;s tissue and, in time, the patient&apos;s body may replace the transplanted tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Broadly, the invention is used to construct a shaped body having a final volume sized to consume at least a portion of the intervertebral disc space, with the biologic tissue and filler material enabling the body to cyclically compress and expand in a manner similar to the disc material being replaced or augmented. Various filler materials may be used to impart an appropriate level of compressibility, including polymeric urethanes, elastomers, or other biologic tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In any case, the body may assume some form of collapsed state permitting easier insertion, and a final state having superior and inferior surfaces preferably conformal to the concavities of the vertebral endplates. The superior and inferior surfaces may accordingly be convex, and may further include grooves, spikes, or other protrusions to maintain the body within the intervertebral space. The body may further be wedge-shaped to help restore or maintain lordosis, particularly if the prosthesis is introduced into the cervical or lumbar regions of the spine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Devices according to the invention may be attached to the inside and/or outside of the annulus by stitches, staples, adhesives, or other suitable techniques. Alternatively, the device may be attached to the vertebra above and below the disc by screws, staples, tacks, or porous material for bone ingrowth such as titanium. Other methods of attachment to the annulus or vertebrae would also be acceptable if the overall goals of the invention are otherwise achieved.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This invention resides in prosthetic disc replacement and annulus augmentation devices using human or animal tissue which exhibit a desirable level of compression along the spine. In the preferred embodiments, a bag or sealed body is fashioned from fascia, skin, or other applicable tissue from a living or recently deceased human or animal donor, and used to supplement the annulus fibrosis or partially or entirely replace a disc. Such devices may aid the ingrowth of the patient&apos;s tissue and, in time, the patient&apos;s body may replace the transplanted tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Broadly, and in general terms, a device according to the invention comprises a bag or shaped body which either contains a material, or is filled with a material, enabling the body to cyclically compress and expand in a manner similar to natural disc material. Such materials may be natural, synthetic, or a combination thereof. For example, the enclosure may be filled with biologic tissue from the patient or other human/animal donor. Such tissue may include, though not limited to, disc tissue, tendon, ligament, or meniscus. In these and in other situations disclosed herein, the bag may be porous to allow for fluids to pass through the enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an inflatable embodiment, a prosthetic disc according to the invention is sealed to be filled with air, oxygen or another suitable gas or gas mixtures. The body may also be filled with a liquid, oil, saline solution, elastomer, or gel. Hydrogels used in this embodiment are preferably sealed in the prosthetic disc in a dehydrated state. Once the prosthetic disc is placed in the spine, a liquid is added through the valve or directly through the prosthetic disc (e.g., by a needle and a syringe) to hydrate the hydrogel. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,055 and 5,192,326 provide a listing of hydrogels, at least certain of which are applicable to this invention. One advantage of hydrating the gel in a sealed body is that even if pinholes form in the body, the device will still function properly, assuming biocompatible filler materials are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, the body may contain one or more liquids or solids which, when mixed, produce a gas, thereby filling the body. For example, baking soda and vinegar may be used or other materials which offer a greater ratio of starting materials to the final volume, including expandable foams. In the event that a liquid is one of the components, it may be contained in an ampoule of some kind which is opened upon insertion of the body into the disc space, thereby allowing the constituent materials to mix. In a different arrangement, the body may include some form of structure with a window or other port which becomes compromised in the presence of externally supplied energy in the form of ultrasound, heat, etc., thereby allowing a foam to expand, reactants to mix, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to a different preferred embodiment, the prosthetic disc does not contain a cavity, but is constructed of a biologically compatible yet compressible material such as silicone or rubber with a cover formed of human or animal tissue. In this embodiment, the prosthesis would not be inflated or imbibe fluid to expand. Rather, the prosthesis would preferably be compressed or deformed prior to insertion into the disc space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the embodiment, the prosthetic disc according to the invention would be inserted through the annulus fibrosis in a surgical procedure. The surgeon would cut a flap or hole in the annulus, and the degenerated nucleus pulpous would be removed according to the standard techniques. One, two, or more prosthesis according to the invention would then be introduced into the disc space, depending upon the location in the body, patient physiology, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although the size examples shown in the drawings may be implied as applicable to human lumbar disc, the prosthesis according to the invention may also be provided for cervical and thoracic discs as well as other joints of the body or animals, through appropriate geometrical scaling. In addition, although it is implied that when multiple prosthesis are used, the same embodiment of the prosthesis would be introduced into the disc space, this is not necessarily always the case, since the various embodiments disclosed herein may be mixed and matched, even within the same disc space, depending upon the physical arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The prostheses could be inserted through the posterior, anterior, or lateral portion of the intervertebral disc by standard surgical procedures. In each case, the prosthesis would come in various sizes to accommodate different size discs. If two prostheses are used in one disc space, each prosthesis would measure approximately 10-30 mm&times;10-20 mm&times;5-20 mm. If one prosthesis is used, it would measure approximately 10-30 mm&times;20-40 mm&times;5-20 mm. The prostheses could be used in cervical, thoracic, or lumbar discs of animals and humans. In addition the device could be used in other joints, including the ankle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing which illustrates the implantation of one prosthesis according to the invention as viewed upwardly toward the head of the recipient. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing of the single prosthesis as seen from the back, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> is a view from the side. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing of the invention utilizing two prosthesis per disc as viewed upwardly toward the head of the recipient. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing as viewed front to back and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing as viewed from the side. The prosthesis may be placed front to back or back to front, depending upon if entry is made through the back or abdomen of the patient. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing of an alternative configuration utilizing two prosthesis per disc placed laterally. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a view from the back, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> is a simplified drawing of a lateral placement as viewed front to side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Particularly when a single prosthesis is used, it will preferably feature convex superior and inferior surfaces so as to conform to the concavities of the vertebral end plates. In addition, the prosthesis may be wedge-shaped, such that the anterior surface is taller than the posterior surface. Such a shape is particularly beneficial in restoring or maintaining lordosis in the cervical and lumbar region of the spine. In the event that a plurality of prostheses are positioned anterior to posterior, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, it may be advantageous to place thicker or less resilient devices anteriorally, with devices having a smaller cross-section or more compressible durometer posteriorally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the case of two prosthesis, two annular flaps <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> would preferably be created as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a drawing which shows the annular flaps in an open state. A prosthesis or prostheses may also be inserted through one annular flap. In addition, the prosthesis or prostheses may be inserted through the annular window that follows a procedure to remove a herniated nucleus pulpous. If annular flaps are formed, they may be sewn or sealed closed after insertion of the artificial disc or discs. The prosthetic disc or discs could restore a collapsed disc space by inflation of the prosthesis or prostheses. The vertebrae may also be distracted to restore normal disc height and aid the insertion of the prosthesis or prostheses, mechanically. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E, a malleable band <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of flexible plastic, metal or other material may be inserted through the annular flaps as shown, a material with a shape memory may be beneficial for such purpose. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows a situation wherein a collapsed replacement is inserted into one of the two openings, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> shows a disc replacement member according to the invention being inserted into the other opening. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows how the band of material <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> would be used to close both openings through suturing or other appropriate surgical techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4F through 4H</cross-reference> illustrate alternative approaches, wherein panels may be attached to adjacent vertebrae for the purpose of retaining disc replacement material. As shown in the front-view drawing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F, a</cross-reference> flexible piece of material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be attached to adjacent vertebrae in the form of a rectangular shape or cords. Such a material would permit normal movement of the spine, and may be attached to upper and lower vertebrae through any appropriate known technique for fixation. A cloth fabric, such as Gore-Tex&reg; or Dacron&reg;, a mesh screen such as nylon, or tissue from a live or recently deceased human or animal may be attached to the adjacent vertebrae as shown, allowing normal movement. Such a technique would be used primarily when the prosthetic disc is placed from an anterior approach to the spine, whether cervical thoracic or lumbar, and would help to restore normal annular function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to a flexible fabric, screen, or tissue one or more retaining members <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may alternatively be utilized. Such a member, which may be plastic, metal or other suitable material, would be attached to one or both of the adjacent vertebrae as shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</cross-reference> is a drawing which shows the fabric <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in panels <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, as viewed from the side. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</cross-reference> illustrates how materials may be applied in cris-cross fashion, in the form of bands, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Mechanical distraction of the vertebra may also be used for disc replacement. U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,093, for example, describes an air jack that could be inserted through one of the flaps. Once the distraction is achieved, a prosthesis is inserted through the other annular flap. Air jacks of the type disclosed in the &apos;093 patent may also be inserted through both annular flaps to achieve symmetric distraction. When properly distracted, one air jack may be deflated and removed. The first prosthesis would be inserted into the space formerly occupied by the air jack. After the first prosthesis is inserted, the second air jack would be deflated and removed. A second prosthesis would be inserted into the remaining disc space. A crank scissors jack could also be used to distract the vertebrae. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The intra-discal position of the prosthesis or prostheses may be maintained in a number of ways. First, the prosthesis diameter is larger in the center portion than the periphery. Second, the prosthesis expands after insertion through the annular opening. Third, the majority of annulus fibrosis is preserved. Fourth, the prosthesis exerts constant pressure on the adjacent vertebrae, securing a tight fit. Fifth, the vertebrae may be distracted so as to enlarge the disc space prior to inserting the prosthesis. When the distraction is released after prosthesis insertion, the tension placed on the annular fibers will serve to hold the prosthesis in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a drawing of an embodiment of the invention showing the way in which pieces of tissue <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> may be attached with sutures to form a bag/sealed body according to the invention. It will be appreciated that this is not the only way in which such tissue pieces may be joined, and that other constructions are possible. For example, the tissue may be cut into strips and woven together in basket form or &ldquo;Chinese finger traps&rdquo; sufficient to receive a filler. Alternatively, the tissue may be fashioned into a pouch with a first string or other type of closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that different types of tissue may be used, as appropriate including fascia from recently deceased human or animal donors, or skin from a recently deceived human or animal donor. The skin or other tissue pieces may be processed to make them more durable. For example, a tanning process may be used to create a leather-like material used in the hide processing industry. Generally, the use of chemicals and drying processes are well known to those in the area of tissue banking. While animal skins may alternatively be used, clearly the treatments involved would not use substances that could otherwise be harmful to the human recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an alternative embodiment of the way in which an elongated tissue bag or sealed body may be constructed. In particular, pieces may be rolled or folded onto one another and sutured together to form a tube, particularly if multiple devices are used in the same disc space. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> gap may be left in a portion of the device through which to insert filler material, biologic or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Generally, only one prosthetic disc would be placed into the disc space in the cervical region of the spine. If multiple prostheses are used, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 3C</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F, the shapes may further include an interlocking structure to help hold them in place, at least relative to one another. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a lateral scheme for interlocking adjoining shaped bodies, whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> illustrates a vertical arrangement much like puzzle pieces. Truly interlocking mechanisms may also be utilized, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, which incorporates knobs received by receptacles, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>E, which illustrates a band of material which is fastened to adjacent devices through any appropriate form of fastener. </paragraph>
