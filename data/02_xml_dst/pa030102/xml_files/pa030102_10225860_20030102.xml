<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application is a divisional of Ser. No. 09/814,589 filed on Mar. 22, 2001. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a stress-relieving heatsink structure for an electronic package, for instance, that includes a semiconductor chip which is mounted on a wired carrier, such as a circuitized substrate. Moreover, the invention is also directed to a method of attaching a stress-relieving heatsink structure to an electronic package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The utilization of heatsink structures which are adapted to remove and dissipate heat generated by electronic packages, such as those comprising printed or wired circuit boards mounting one or more a semiconductor chips is well known in the technology. Generally, heatsink configurations include either flat cap structures which are arranged above the semiconductor chip and heat conductively attached thereto; or heatsinks which are constituted of relatively thick and stiff base structures having pins or fins projecting therefrom in a direction or directions facing away from the electronic package or semiconductor chip so as to afford a good heat spreading capability while concurrently enabling the low cost manufacture thereof through the intermediary of suitable extrusion forming methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Ordinarily, in order to provide good thermal absorption of heat from the electronic package, the heatsink structure is adhesively attached through the interposition of a thin layer of a thermally conductive adhesive. However, depending upon the type of electronic package, the stiffness of the base portion of the heatsink structure may prevent achievement of very high reliability of the electronic package due to a constraining effect produced by the structure thereof. The constraining effect can contribute to delamination and higher internal stresses, which can lead to eventual thermal fatigue of the electronic package components, in accelerated life testing. Flexible electronic packages, (such as may have organic components in the form of the substrates or carriers mounting the integrated or printed circuits and forming integrated circuit boards), are more vulnerable to the constraining effect of the heatsink arrangement and can benefit by the use of a heatsink which does not create high stresses in the package and package interconnections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In essence, heatsinks which have a high bending stiffniess can contribute to high stresses during operation of the electronic package, which causes a significant amount of strain and stress to be imparted to the thermal adhesive which is employed in order to attach the heatsink to the electronic package, whereby the relative deformation encountered among the various components causes failure in the operation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Currently employed heatsinks fail to provide for structures which are designed to adequately reduce stresses and strains generated during the operation of the electronic package as a result of generated heat, and which would tend to prevent delamination or fatigue of the electronic package components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In particular, even present heatsink structures which are joined to each other fail to provide low stress joining arrangements in forming the combination thereof which would reduce stresses and strains to acceptable levels. These known structures do not address themselves to deriving the advantages which are obtainable by combining several heatsinks together prior to the assembly thereof with the electronic package components, which would require only a single location joining operation to be utilized during assembly, and a well controlled placement of the heatsinks relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, Hamburgen, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,430 discloses an integrated thermal coupling for a heat generating device wherein heatsink structures include fins which are adapted to be interleaved to provide for enhanced heat dissipation. Although this provides an extensive degree of thermal contact between two separable heatsinks, the structure thereof is lightly complex, and fails to disclose the use of the effects of an adhesive interconnection between adjoining heatsink components, whereas contrastingly, the present invention teaches the mitigation of stress caused through the use of a heat conductive adhesive between the electronic package components and a composite heatsink arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Chaney, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,697 discloses heatsink consisting of a plate-like base member having a plurality of fins projecting therefrom, and which is adapted to dissipate heat generated by the electronic package. The structure disclosed in this patent fails to provide a multi-segmented heatsink arrangement which is adapted to reduce thermal mechanical stresses of the heatsink when coupled to the electronic package component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Tzu, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,973,407 discloses a heat spreader arrangement which is integrally connected to a semiconductor package, and wherein a plurality of bumps and heatsink plate portions are adapted to disperse and dissipate heat to the exterior environment. There is no disclosure of a segmented heatsink arrangement which incorporates low-stress interconnections in order to avoid or reduce to tenable levels and the stresses and strains encountered during the generation of heat by the electronic package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Similarly, Lee U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,987 discloses a heat spreader for semiconductor packages which includes different pad sizes adapted to conjointly dissipate heat generated by the package. However, as in the previously discussed prior art publications, there is no low-stress interconnection between various discrete heatsink segments which are combined to form an overall heatsink arrangement which would prevent delamination of the components of the electronic package caused by heat generated by the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other patents for example, such as Lester U.S. Pat. No. 5,043,796 disclose multiple component heatsink structures which are interconnected in various regions so as to provide stress relief fracture paths. However, the stress-relief interconnections are merely constituted by reducing the thickness of part of the heatsink element to provide some bending ability, and does not in actuality produce a separate components which are adapted to be combined with other separate components to form a complete structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Similarly, Leecraft, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,296,455 also discloses a plurality of discrete heatsink components which do not, in actuality enable the reduction of stresses tending to delaminate the heatsink structure from the remaining portions of the electronic package to which they are fastened through the intermediary of an adhesive material, but which does not provide a unitarily connected entity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, pursuant to the present invention, there is provided a novel heatsink structure which incorporates a base structure incorporating stress-relieving slits forming discrete heatsink segments, whereby there is effectively reduced the constraining effect of a single large-sized heatsink with no appreciable loss in the thermal performance of the electronic package. Through the incorporation of low-stress adhesives, or possibly in some instances, snap fits, milled interlocking clearance slots, hinges or other low stress joining structures as the stress relieving slits provided intermediate various separate components of the heat sink structure or arrangement, a plurality of essentially smaller-sized separate heat sinks can be combined into one larger-sized low-stress heatsink structure which is pre-assembled and attached to the electronic package to enable the maximum heat-dissipation therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to preferred embodiments of the invention, an advantageous, choice for a low-stress adhesive material which may be used as connective material in the stress relieving slits intermediate the various separate heatsink substructures, there may be provided silicone or epoxy resin adhesives which are potentially constituted from the same type of material as the adhesive which is utilized to join the heatsink structure to the electronic package, such as the printed circuit or wiring board and the electronic component, such as the semiconductor chip or chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel heatsink structure for an electronic package which includes stress-relieving slits formed in the heatsink structure to form a plurality of essentially combinable discrete or separate smaller heatsink substructure, and which upon being adhesively attached to each other will provide for a stress-relieving arrangement while still maintaining good thermal conductivity in the heat dissipation from the electronic package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a heatsink structure constituted of a plurality of combined smaller-sized heatsink devices or substructures which are joined along slitted edges through the intermediary of a low-stress adhesive or suitable engaging means, which will enable a certain degree of flexibility to be imparted to the overall heatsink structures so as to prevent delamination caused by heat-induced strains and stresses encountered during operation of the electronic component on which the heatsink is mounted, by a resultant reduction of the strains due to an enhanced flexibility and bendability of the heatsink structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of forming the novel heatsink structure which is constituted of a plurality of joined or adhesively interconnected smaller heatsink components or substructures in a stress-relieving manner while the thermal conductivity of the electronic package is essentially maintained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now in specific detail to the drawings, and particularly Figures <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, there is illustrated an electronic package which includes a heatsink in accordance with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In particular, the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a printed or wired circuit board or card <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has a semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> positioned thereon, with the interposition of solder balls <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and underfill material (not shown), as is well known in the technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Arranged above the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and facing the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> thereof opposite the side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> facing the circuit board or card <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is provided a heatsink structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for dissipating heat generated by the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during operation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The heatsink structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, in this instance, is constituted of a relatively thick unitary base member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of generally flat or planar configuration, preferably constituted of a copper or aluminum material or composition, which extends in spaced relationship over and possibly beyond the peripheral confines of the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The heatsink structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has the unitary base member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> equipped with a plurality of upstanding spaced fins or pin members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are intended to assist in further enhancing the dispersing and dissipating of heat from the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Interposed between the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the facing surface of the heatsink base member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a suitable adhesive <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which may be of a heat conductive nature, such as a silicone or an epoxy resin adhesive, and which may be of a similar material as an adhesive (not shown) which interconnects and encapsulates the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the substrate or printed circuit board <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the base member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or heat sink structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As may be ascertained from the prior art, during heat-generating operation of the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and depending upon the type of electronic package, the stiffness of the base member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, due to its relatively rigid or inflexible nature, and the generally flexible or organic laminated electronic package substrates <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which are frequently utilized in this technology, the differences in the bending properties and possibly coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) may cause delamination and a significant loss of reliability of the electronic package due to the constraining effect caused by the rigidity of the unitarily constructed heatsink element or structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to ameliorate the problems encountered in the employment of a unitary or single heatsink base member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is inherently of a considerable greater degree of thickness relative to the remaining components of the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, pursuant to the present invention it has been proposed to provide stress-relieving slits in a heatsink member, having particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the drawings, wherein components which are similar to or identical with those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are identified by the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as illustrated, the use of stress relieving slits or grooves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between adjoining heatsink base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, may significantly reduce any strains on the thermal adhesive which is employed for attaching the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in effect the adhesive which bonds the lower surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of each separate of the base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the facing surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, grooving which has been employed in the prior art as in Lester U.S. Pat. No. 5,043,796, has to some extent relieved delamination-causing stresses. However, this has not been adequate to prevent fatiguing of the adhesive material and the resultant failure in the operation of the electronic package, or at least in reducing the reliability thereof, because bending stiffness of the heatsink base <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> was not significantly reduced as in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the heat stress-relieving heatsink component is formed by means of separate heatsink base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which are separately produced and then assembled with each other prior to being positioned on and attached to the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this connection, each of the base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provides a portion of the generally flat base thereof, analogous to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and wherein the smaller segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are initially preassembled and combined with each other with the edges in the form of the slits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adhesively connected to each other, preferably by means of a silicone or epoxy adhesive <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is heat conductive so as not to reduce the heat dissipating properties and characteristics of the entire heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, while concurrently providing for a stress relieving property which significantly reduces strains on the thermal adhesive <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> normally used to attach the lower stress heatsink to the electronic package. This particular type of slitted construction, and the forming of separate heatsink segments which are adhesively preassembled into the overall heatsink arrangement or structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, enables the utilization of a highly-filled thermally-efficient adhesive, such as a silicone or epoxy resin, for the electronic package and which generally can tolerate less strain to failure during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Rather than utilizing an adhesive <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the slits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the heatsink segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is also possible that the separate base members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be interconnected along the separating lines or slits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the intermediary of snap fits, milled interlocking clearance slots, hinges or other low-stress joining means rather than an adhesive provided at the stress-relieving slits so as to assemble several smallersized heat sink elements or segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into one large-sized low-stress heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. However, although this may of course, assist in reducing the potential for failure due to the generation of strains or stresses which would tend to delaminate the adhesive interconnecting the heatsink base <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or components of the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, these alternative mechanical methods may require machining or other methods of production which may be somewhat more expensive and complicated in comparison with simply applying a good heat-conductive adhesive material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> interconnecting the base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the slits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, it would be advantageous and inexpensive in connection with the production, if the adhesive material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is used as a low-stress component in the stress-relieving slits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the various heatsink segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> be constituted of an adhesive including silicones, potentially of the same type of adhesive <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> utilized to attach the heatsink base component to the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; in effect, that used to interconnect the semiconductor chip package <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the facing surface of the heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to a further embodiment of the invention, as disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the drawings, there is disclosed the provision of solder-filled slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> intermediate the various base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forming the overall heatsink structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this connection, this type of construction enables the use of a solder adhesive interface for the attachment of the heatsink. Although solder is known to frequently fatigue and fracture under strain, and consequently it is critical to relieve any thermal strains imposed on a solder interface layer, the present invention provides for a construction which reduces the strain on the solder interface. Inasmuch as solder is relatively hard, in comparison with silicone adhesives, it is thus important to ameliorate the stiffniess of the heatsink base structure, whereby the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes is acceptable as to its reliability and operation. This is rendered possible through the combination of the solder adhesive interface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with stress-relieving features, such as the solder-filled slits of the heatsink components, inasmuch as the solder possesses a relatively good thermal conductivity, such that a high-thermal performance heatsink with low-stress when attached to the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be readily attained. In particular, solder with hierarchial melt temperatures would provide an excellent alternative to adhesives constituted of silicone, and with the lower-melt solder being also utilized to attach the low stress heatsink base segments <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the electronic package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it becomes readily apparent that by means of the slits which are formed in the heatsink arrangement, whereby a plurality of smaller heatsink elements are preassembled with each other to form a larger heatsink structure extending over the entire surface area of the semiconductor chip, and with the interposition in the slits of either a thermally conductive adhesive constituted of a silicone, or possibly a solder-type adhesive as described hereinabove, or mechanical interconnections this would readily mitigate any formation of strains and stresses during operation of the electronic package normally tending to delaminate the package components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing form the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
