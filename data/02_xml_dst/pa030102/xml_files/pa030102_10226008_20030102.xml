<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Capacitors having increased capacitance include an enhanced-surface-area (rough-surfaced) electrically conductive layer or other layers that are compatible with the high-dielectric constant materials. In one approach, an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer for such capacitors is formed by processing a ruthenium oxide layer at high temperature at or above 500&deg; C. and low pressure 75 torr or below, most desirably 5 torr or below, to produce a roughened ruthenium layer having a textured surface with a mean feature size of at least about 100 Angstroms. The initial ruthenium oxide layer may be provided by chemical vapor deposition techniques or sputtering techniques or the like. The layer may be formed over an underlying electrically conductive layer. The processing may be performed in an inert ambient or in a reducing ambient. A nitrogen-supplying ambient or nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient may be used during the processing or afterwards to passivate the ruthenium for improved compatibility with high-dielectric-constant dielectric materials. Processing in an oxidizing ambient may also be performed to passivate the roughened layer. The roughened layer of ruthenium may be used to form an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer. The resulting enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer may form a plate of a storage capacitor in an integrated circuit, such as in a memory cell of a DRAM or the like. In another approach, a tungsten nitride layer is provided as an first electrode of such a capacitor. The capacitor, or at least the tungsten nitride layer, is annealed to increase the capacitance of the capacitor. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention pertains to semiconductor devices and the fabrication thereof, and particularly to ruthenium- and tungsten-containing electrically conductive layers and the formation and use thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A capacitor generally includes two electrical conductors in close proximity to, but separated from, each other. The two conductors form the &ldquo;plates&rdquo; of the capacitor, and may be separated by a dielectric material. When a voltage is applied across the plates of a capacitor, electrical charge accumulates on the plates. If the plates are electrically isolated essentially immediately after a voltage is applied, the accumulated charge may be stored on the plates, thus &ldquo;storing&rdquo; the applied voltage difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The fabrication of integrated circuits involves the formation of electrically conductive layers for use as various circuit components, including for use as capacitor plates. Memory circuits, such as DRAMs and the like, use electrically conductive layers to form the opposing plates of storage cell capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The drive for higher-performance, lower-cost integrated circuits dictates ever-decreasing area for individual circuit features, including storage capacitors. Since capacitance of a capacitor (the amount of charge that can be stored as a function of applied voltage) generally varies with the area of capacitor plates, as the circuit area occupied by the storage capacitor decreases, it is desirable to take steps to preserve or increase capacitance despite the smaller occupied area, so that circuit function is not compromised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various steps may be taken to increase or preserve capacitance without increasing the occupied area. For example, material(s) having higher dielectric constant may be used between the capacitor plates. Further, the plate surfaces may be roughened to increase the effective surface area of the plates without increasing the area occupied by he capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One method for providing a roughened surface for a plate of a storage cell capacitor is to form the plate of hemispherical grain polysilicon (HSG), possibly with an overlying metal layer. The hemispherical grains of HSG enhance the surface area of the plate without increasing its occupied area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> HSG presents difficulties in fabrication, however, because of the formation of silicon dioxide on and near the HSG. A silicon dioxide layer may form on the HSG, particularly during deposition of the capacitor&apos;s dielectric layer. Even with an intervening metal layer present, oxygen from the deposition of the dielectric layer can diffuse through the metal layer, forming silicon dioxide at the polysilicon surface. Silicon diffusion through the metal layer may also produce a silicon dioxide layer between the metal and the dielectric layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Silicon dioxide between the metal layer and the HSG can degrade the electrical contact to the metal capacitor plate surface. Silicon dioxide between the metal layer and the dielectric layer can decrease the capacitance of the resulting capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To attempt to avoid these negative effects caused by formation of silicon dioxide, a diffusion barrier layer may be employed between the HSG and the metal layer. However, in the typical capacitor geometry, the greater the total number of layers, the larger the required minimum area occupied by the capacitor. Further, the upper surface of each additional layer deposited tends to be smoother than the underlying surface, reducing the increased surface area provided by an underlying rough layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While high-dielectric constant materials are known, many of these advantageous materials are formed with processes that are incompatible with other materials needed to form capacitors. For example, processes needed to form a particular dielectric layer can oxidize or otherwise impair the properties of the electrode layer on which the dielectric layer is to be formed. These processes can be incompatible because of the necessary process temperatures or process ambients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, improved materials and methods are needed for forming conducting layers, insulating layers, and capacitors using such layers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved conductive layers, dielectric layers, capacitors, methods for forming such layers, and capacitors using the layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a representative embodiment, enhanced-surface-area (rough-surfaced) ruthenium containing electrically conductive layers are provided. These layers are compatible with high-dielectric-constant materials and are useful in the formation of integrated circuits, particularly for plates of storage capacitors in memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one approach, the enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer may be formed by first forming a ruthenium oxide containing film or layer. The layer may be stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric, and may be amorphous or may have both ruthenium (Ru) and ruthenium oxide (RuO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) phases and may include other materials. The film may be formed, for example, by chemical vapor deposition techniques or by sputtering or any suitable techniques. The film may be formed over an underlying layer which may be electrically conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The ruthenium oxide film may be processed at low pressure and high temperature&mdash;generally at pressures at least about 75 torr or below, desirably about 20 torr or below, most desirably about 5 torr or below&mdash;and at temperatures in the range of about 500 to 900&deg; C., desirably about 750 to about 850&deg; C.&mdash;so as to convert at least some of the ruthenium oxide to ruthenium and to yield a roughened ruthenium-containing layer with a mean grain size desirably in the range of about 100 Angstroms or larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The heating process, or anneal, is desirably performed in a non-oxidizing ambient. In an example embodiment, a nitrogen-supplying ambient or nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient may be used during the anneal. A nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient may be used to passivate the ruthenium for improved compatibility with high-dielectric-constant dielectric materials. In another alternative, a nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient may be used in a post-anneal to passivate an already roughened layer. In still another alternative, a post-anneal in an oxidizing ambient may be performed, following either the roughening anneal or the nitride-passivation anneal, as desired. This oxidizing post-anneal provides oxygen to the roughened layer to reduce the tendency of the ruthenium to scavenge oxygen during later processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The enhanced-surface-area layer may be formed with or without a pre-anneal, performed at a higher pressure (such as about 600 torr), before the low pressure, high temperature anneal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The roughened layer of ruthenium may be used to provide an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In an example embodiment, the roughened layer of ruthenium may be formed on an underlying electrically conductive layer, with the roughened layer and the underlying layer together functioning as an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment, an electrically conductive layer may be formed on or over the roughened layer, with the overlying electrically conductive layer and the roughened layer constituting an enhanced-surface area electrically conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In either case, in an example capacitor embodiment for use in an integrated circuit, the resulting enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer may be used to form a plate of a storage capacitor in an integrated circuit, such as in a memory cell of a DRAM or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The ruthenium-containing enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer, particularly in the case of an anneal in nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient with an oxidizing post-anneal, has reduced tendency toward oxidation and is thus more compatible with the use of high-dielectric-constant dielectric materials, while still providing enhanced surface area. In addition, even if the ruthenium-containing layer oxidizes, it remains conductive. An additional metal layer thus may potentially be omitted from the capacitor structure, allowing smaller dimensions for capacitors with the same or even greater capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a tungsten nitride layer is provided as a first electrode layer. A dielectric layer and a second electrode layer are conformally applied to the first electrode layer to form a capacitor. The capacitor, or at least the tungsten nitride layer, is annealed at an anneal temperature to increase the capacitance of the capacitor. In a specific embodiment, the anneal temperature is at least 500 C. and the capacitor (or the tungsten nitride layer) is maintained at the anneal temperature for at least 30 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> These methods, conductive and dielectric layers, and structures using the layers allow the design and fabrication of higher speed, higher density, and lower cost integrated circuits.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows creation of a surface-area-enhanced ruthenium electrically conductive layer that has improved compatibility with high-dielectric-constant (&ldquo;high-&kgr;&rdquo;) dielectric materials as compared to hemispherical-grain polysilicon (HSG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The surface-area-enhanced electrically conductive layer is created by heating a film or layer comprising ruthenium oxide such as the layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The heating process, which may anneal the film or layer, is typically performed at low pressures of less than about 75 torr, desirably less than about 20 torr, and most desirably less than about 5 torr, and at high temperatures in the range of about 500 to 900&deg; C., desirably about 750 to 850&deg; C. The treatment is desirably performed in a non-oxidizing ambient. The heating process may be performed in a noble ambient, nitrogen ambient, or the like, or in a reducing ambient, which may reduce the temperature required. The heating process may also be performed in an electrically neutral environment, or with plasma or glow-discharge assistance or the like, which may also reduce the temperature required. Heating under relatively low pressure converts at least a portion of the ruthenium oxide to ruthenium and produces a rough surface on the layer. Temperature and pressure are preferably selected so as to enhance the ruthenium oxide to ruthenium conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The surface-area-enhanced electrically conductive layer may be formed on a supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in partial cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be any structure present in or on an integrated circuit during the fabrication thereof. In a typical example application, the supporting structure may be an electrically conductive material that will be in electrical contact with a capacitor plate formed by the surface-area-enhanced electrically conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The ruthenium oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed by any suitable method. Specific examples of such methods include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or related process, or sputtering or related process, or the like. The ruthenium oxide layer may be stoichiometric ruthenium oxide (RuO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or non-stoichiometric ruthenium oxide (RuO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed via CVD, the deposition may be performed, for example, at pressures of 1-20 torr, desirably about 5 torr. The oxygen may be supplied in the form of O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or other oxidizing gas, such as N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, NO, or ozone (O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). The oxygenating gas and a ruthenium precursor, and suitable diluent gasses, if desired, may be supplied at suitable flow rates, such as in the range of about 100-2000 sccm. Alternatively, the ruthenium precursor can be deliver by direct vaporization. Deposition may be performed for a time in the range of about 10 to 500 seconds, desirably for sufficient time and under sufficient conditions to deposit RuO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>or RuO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to a thickness in the range of about 100 to 600 Angstroms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The resulting ruthenium oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may optionally be pre-annealed, such as by rapid thermal anneal (RTA) in hydrogen or other suitable anneal environment at pressures in the range of 500 to 700 torr and temperatures in the range of 500 to 900&deg; C. The pre-anneal stabilizes the film, promoting crystallization of ruthenium and ruthenium oxide phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The ruthenium oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with or without a pre-anneal, is then treated at low pressure and high temperature as described above. The treatment may reduce the proportion of ruthenium oxide in the layer and increase the proportion of ruthenium. The ruthenium oxide in the ruthenium oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is partially or completely converted to ruthenium by the anneal, leaving an enhanced-surface-area layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in the cross section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. While the enhanced-surface-area layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is referred to by separate reference character for convenience herein, it should be noted that the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed from the layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is the same layer in that sense. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a partial plan view of the roughened ruthenium layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Although the example roughened ruthenium layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in the figures is discontinuous, this is by way of example only and continuous films may also be produced. Increased thickness of the initial layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> tends to produce more continuous films, as does reduced temperature and increased pressure during the anneal and reduced anneal time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The anneal may be performed in a noble, nitrogen, or reducing ambient or the like. As an additional example embodiment, an anneal may be performed in a nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient such as such as ammonia, nitrogen, a nitrogen and hydrogen mixture, and the like. The anneal parameters may be selected such that &ldquo;nitrogen-passivated&rdquo; ruthenium in the form of RuN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is formed in the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, at least near the outermost surfaces thereof, passivating the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As another example alternative, nitride passivation may be used in the form of a post-anneal in a nitrogen-supplying reducing ambient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As yet another variation, a desirably brief post-anneal in an oxidizing ambient such as oxygen or ozone may be performed on the already roughened layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to form &ldquo;oxygen-passivated&rdquo; ruthenium or ruthenium nitride in the outermost portions of the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (RuO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>or RuO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>), in order to reduce or prevent the ruthenium from later scavenging oxygen from a nearby dielectric material. The oxidizing post-anneal may optionally follow a nitride passivation post-anneal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the roughened ruthenium layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, together with the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> if electrically conductive, may together constitute an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> compatible with high-dielectric-constant dielectric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> produced such as described above may also be used in cooperation with other layers. This may be useful in cases where the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may not be electrically conductive or may be incompatible with high-dielectric-constant dielectric materials. In the discussion and claims herein, &ldquo;on&rdquo; used with respect to two layers, one &ldquo;on&rdquo; the other, means at least some contact between the layers, while &ldquo;over&rdquo; means the layers are in close proximity, but possibly with one or more additional intervening layers such that contact is not required. Neither &ldquo;on&rdquo; nor &ldquo;over&rdquo; implies any directionality as used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of material may be formed over the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with the roughened ruthenium layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> then formed on the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be an electrically conductive layer to electrically connect all portions of layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also act as a barrier layer to prevent contact between high-dielectric-constant dielectrics, to be used for capacitor formation, and the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is an electrically conductive layer, layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> together with layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> constitute an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Any compatible electrically conductive material may be used, such as Pt, Ir, IrO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, Rh, RuSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, and SrRuO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and alloys thereof as well as RuSiO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and RuSiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of electrically conductive material may be formed conformally over the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and over the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, together with the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, then constitutes an enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As with the layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may function to electrically connect all portions of layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and may also function as a barrier layer to prevent contact between high-dielectric-constant dielectrics and the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Examples of such electrically conductive materials include the materials listed in the preceding paragraph. Ruthenium oxide is a desirable material because of compatibility with the underlying ruthenium layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described by way of example above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or one or more layers above or below the layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (or both) may be electrically conductive and may be employed as needed to obtain conductivity and other desired properties. The resulting enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, shown by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is represented generically as layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. To form a capacitor with the enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of dielectric material, most desirably a high-dielectric-constant dielectric material (generally any dielectric with a dielectric constant of at least 9), such as tantalum pentoxide (Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), may be formed conformally over the enhanced-surface-area electrically conductive layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Other high-constant dielectrics may also be employed, such as barium strontium titanium oxide (Ba,Sr)TiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, lead zirconium titanium oxide Pb(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and strontium bismuth tantalum oxide (SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>), for example. The layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is desirably sufficiently thin and conforming to provide an at least somewhat enhanced surface area on the surface away from the layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may then be formed conformally over the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The surface of layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> uppermost in the figure is not shown because the layer may generally be of any thickness sufficiently thick to insure continuity of the layer and sufficiently thin to fit within the overall volume allotted to the capacitor. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the surface of layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> next to the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> desirably conforms to the enhanced surface area of the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, providing an enhanced surface area for the electrically conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as well. The two electrically conductive layers, layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, form the two plates of a capacitor. Both plates desirably have enhanced surface area relative to the area occupied by the capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Application of the plate structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to a container capacitor is illustrated in the cross-section of a container capacitor shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. The supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be an electrically conductive plug of polysilicon or other electrically conductive material formed at the bottom of an opening in a dielectric material <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG). The lower end of the plug typically electrically contacts a circuit element such as a transistor gate (not shown). At the sides of the cylindrical container, the BPSG itself functions a supporting structure for the capacitor plate structure. The relative thinness of the capacitor structure provided by the layer structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> maximizes the capacitor plate surface area in the container capacitor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, particularly for the inner (upper) electrode, the surface area of which decreases most rapidly with increasing thickness of the layer structure. The use of the enhanced-surface-area ruthenium electrically conductive layer thus provides improved capacitance in a given area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Application of the plate structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> to a stud capacitor is illustrated in the cross-section of a stud capacitor shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. The supporting structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plug <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that extends from a surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the layers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed conformally on the plug <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In a specific example, ruthenium oxide was deposited on substrates of BPSG to a thickness of about 600 Angstroms by CVD. The ruthenium oxide layers were pre-annealed in nitrogen for one minute at 800&deg; C. and 600 torr, then annealed at 800&deg; C. in nitrogen for varying times and at varying pressures. Such a pre-anneal can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On SEM examination, layers annealed for eight minutes at 4.5 torr showed marked surface roughness with mean grain size of about 100 Angstroms or larger, with good uniformity over the substrate surface. Layers annealed for eight minutes at 60 torr showed some surface roughness with a mean grain approaching 100 Angstroms, but with generally less roughness than at 4.5 torr. Layers annealed for eight minutes at 600 torr showed generally still less roughness and still smaller grain sizes than at 60 torr. Layers annealed for two minutes at 4.5 torr also showed a marked surface roughness, with possibly slightly less uniformity over the substrate surface than those annealed for eight minutes. X-ray diffraction studies of the annealed layers showed ruthenium as the primary constituent but the Ru/RuO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ratio varied with processing conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Superior capacitors including metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors can be obtained using a tungsten nitride layer as an electrode. The tungsten nitride layer can be formed by reactive sputtering of a tungsten target in a nitrogen containing ambient, or by a chemical vapor deposition process (CVD) such as a plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), a metallo-organic CVD (MOCVD) process, atomic layer deposition (ALD), or other process. The tungsten nitride layer is conveniently formed using a thermal CVD process using tungsten fluoride (WF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) and ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) as precursors, and a 300 Angstrom thick layer can be formed using such a process in about 1-3 minutes. The thickness of the tungsten nitride layer can be varied but typically the thickness is in the range of 100-1000 Angstroms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As deposited, the tungsten nitride layer can contain a mixture of a stable tungsten nitride compound W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N and a metastable tungsten nitride compound WN. The metastable compound WN can be converted to the stable tungsten nitride compound W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N in a rapid thermal process (RTP) in which the temperature of the tungsten nitride layer is rapidly raised to an anneal temperature in the range of 600-800 C. and held at the anneal temperature for about 60 seconds. Typically, the temperature of the tungsten nitride layer is ramped up to and down from an anneal temperature of 700 C. in less than about 30 seconds. Such an anneal process is typically performed before a dielectric layer and a second electrode are formed on the tungsten nitride layer so that a capacitor structure is otherwise complete. The metastable compound WN may include defects and may be preferentially oxidized during deposition of dielectric materials such as Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and subsequent annealing processes. Therefore, the capacitance of a capacitor formed without an anneal process tends to be low. In addition, the presence of defects tends to increase leakage currents. In a completed capacitor, the anneal process tends to increase capacitance by about 20% with respect to a capacitor without annealing and to reduce leakage currents that occur when voltages are applied to the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A dielectric layer consisting of any of various dielectric materials is formed on the tungsten nitride layer. Suitable dielectric materials include high-dielectric-constant materials such as tantalum pentoxide (Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), doped Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>such as Ti-doped Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, barium strontium titanium oxide (Ba,Sr)TiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, lead zirconium titanium oxide Pb(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, strontium bismuth tantalum oxide (SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>), BaTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SrTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Pb(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Nb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(Nb,Ta)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>. For Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, formation of a stoichiometric compound is preferred so that the Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>layer is not a tantalum rich layer, because tantalum rich Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>layers tend to be conducting, not insulating. Tantalum pentoxide dielectric layers are preferred in some applications because of its large dielectric constant and its stability. However, tantalum pentoxide is typically formed using a MOCVD process in an oxidizing ambient such as an oxygen, ozone, or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O ambient. While many electrode layer materials cannot be exposed to oxidizing ambients, tungsten nitride is relatively unaffected by such ambients and therefore facilitates the use of tantalum pentoxide dielectric layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> An electrode layer of tungsten nitride or other conducting material is formed on the dielectric layer and serves as a top electrode for the capacitor. Other suitable conducting materials include TiN, TiON, WN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, TaN, Ta, Pt, Rh, Pt-Rh, Pt-RhO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, Ru, RuO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, Ir, IrO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, Pt-Ru, Pt-RuO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, Pt-Ir, Pt-IrO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, SrRuO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Au, Pd, Al, Mo, Ag, polysilicon, and alloys thereof. These electrode materials can be formed by various processes. For example, ruthenium and platinum/rhodium are conveniently formed using a CVD process. After the dielectric layer and the electrode layers are formed, the capacitor is annealed as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C illustrate several example capacitor geometries that include tungsten nitride electrodes. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A, a</cross-reference> plate capacitor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed on a surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be any of various substrate materials including GaAs, silicon, or BPSG. The capacitor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a first electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, a second electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In a representative example, the first electrode <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is a tungsten nitride layer, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is a Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>layer, the second electrode is a TiN layer, and the substrate <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is BPSG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When voltages are applied to electrodes of a capacitor such as the capacitor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, some electrical current flows between the electrodes. This current is generally undesirable and is referred to as a &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; current. Plate capacitors having electrodes of tungsten nitride have leakage currents of as little as about 20 nA/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, or as low as about 5 nA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for capacitors having dielectric layers 100 Angstroms thick and with an applied voltage of 1 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B, a</cross-reference> container capacitor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is formed in an etched recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in a substrate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. A tungsten nitride electrode layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> covers a bottom surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a side surface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>dielectric layer <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> covers the electrode layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, substantially filling the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a tungsten nitride electrode layer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (or other conductive layer) covers the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are selected to provide a desired capacitance, and can be selected in conjunction with a minimum feature size for other circuit elements that are formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. In a representative example, the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a diameter D of 200 nm and a depth Z of 1000 nm. For these dimensions, the tungsten nitride layer is preferably about 300 Angstroms (30 nm) thick. Tungsten nitride layers thinner than about 100 Angstroms (10 nm) tend to have voids. Because of these voids, such layers do not act as continuous electrodes, reducing the capacitance of the capacitor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Tungsten nitride layers thicker than about 1000 Angstroms (100 nm) tend to occupy too much of the volume of the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, also limiting the capacitance of the capacitor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. For container capacitors formed in larger recesses, thicker tungsten nitride layers can be used without sacrificing too much capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is generally formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> with an etching process. If the substrate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is BPSG, the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be formed with a dry etch process such as plasma etching. While other etching processes are possible, because the recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is deeper than wide, a selected etch process is preferably anisotropic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C, a</cross-reference> stud capacitor <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is formed on a plug <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> that extends from a surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of a substrate <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. A tungsten nitride electrode layer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is formed on the plug <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and is covered with a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and an electrode layer <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the electrode layer can be formed of any of the materials mentioned above. Representative materials are Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and TiN for the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the electrode layer <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, respectively. The plug <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> may be an electrically conductive plug of polysilicon or other electrically conductive material formed in a recess in the substrate <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> such as a borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG). The lower end of the plug typically electrically contacts a circuit element such as a transistor gate (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the above examples, a tungsten nitride layer is deposited directly on a substrate such as BPSG. Alternatively, a tungsten nitride layer can be formed or deposited on a titanium nitride (TiN) adhesion layer, or other adhesion layer, to improve the bonding of the tungsten nitride layer to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Variations within the scope and spirit of the disclosure above will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the enhanced-surface-area layers can be used in ferroelectric memories to improve storage capacity. The scope of coverage is accordingly defined not by the particular example embodiments and variations explicitly described above, but by the claims below. </paragraph>
