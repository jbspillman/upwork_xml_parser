<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a semiconductor wafer and a production method therefor and particularly, a semiconductor wafer obtained by forming a semiconductor thin film having a uniform resistivity distribution on a main surface of a large diameter semiconductor substrate and a production method therefor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In company with recent miniaturization of an electronic device, not only has the use of semiconductor wafers each obtained by forming a silicon single crystal thin film on a main surface of a silicon single crystal substrate increased, but a more uniform resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film has also been required. The term &ldquo;uniform resistivity distribution&rdquo; used here, to be detailed, means that a resistivity distribution across the surface of the silicon single crystal thin film is uniform. Further, a larger diameter has also been demanded on a semiconductor wafer together with the uniform resistivity distribution. A horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus has been mainly employed as an apparatus for growing a silicon single crystal thin film on a main surface of a silicon single crystal substrate keeping pace with use of a large diameter semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Description will be below given of a horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus generally employed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, wherein <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a sectional view in a horizontal plane showing a conventional horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus in a simplified manner and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a vertical sectional view showing the apparatus in a simplified manner. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, in a conventional horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus, a susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on which a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is horizontally placed is disposed at the bottom of the middle portion of a transparent quartz glass reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> installed along a horizontal direction and the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled with a rotation unit (not shown) through a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, a gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided at one end in a length direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a gas outlet port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided at the other end thereof. With this construction, a flow of a gas which is introduced through the gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and discharged through the gas outlet port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outside passes over a main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> almost along a length direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed of six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>spread in a width direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Among the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, a pair of two inlet ports at-the innermost side (hereinafter simply referred to as inner inlet ports) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in symmetry with respect to an imaginary central axis along a length direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, passing through the center of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and this arrangement of the inner inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>applies to not only a pair of two inlet ports at the outermost side (hereinafter simply referred to as outer inlet ports) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, but also a pair of two inlet ports each between one of the two inner inlet ports and the corresponding one of the two outer inlet ports (hereinafter simply referred to as middle inlet ports) in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To be more detailed, the inner inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are directed toward points in the vicinity of the center of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on an imaginary central axis along a width direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, passing through the center of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the outer inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are directed toward points in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the imaginary central axis line and the middle inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are directed toward points between the central portion and the outer peripheral portion of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the imaginary central axis line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are all connected to a common gas pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The common gas pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are branched in three ways and the branches are connected to a gas source (not shown) of hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) gas as a carrier gas, a gas source (not shown) of a semiconductor raw material gas and a gas source (not shown) of a dopant gas through mass flow controllers MFC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, respectively, as gas flow rate regulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, outside of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for example, as a heat source heating the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed and by supplying a power to the infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is heated to a predetermined temperature. In addition, cooling means (not shown) for cooling the infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an outer wall of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped. Then, description will be made of a method for forming a silicon single crystal thin film on the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the conventional horizontal, single wafer vapor growth apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First, the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is horizontally placed on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Following this, H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the gas source of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas through MFC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the common gas pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and through the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to replace the atmosphere in the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with hydrogen. Further, with the rotation device, the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is rotated through the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> clockwise as shown by arrow marks of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> while the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is horizontally placed on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Then, with the infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is heated to raise a temperature of the main surface thereof to a predetermined one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> After doing so, the semiconductor raw material gas and the dopant gas are supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the respective gas sources of the semiconductor raw material gas and the dopant gas through MFC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the common gas pipe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At this time, not only are flow rates of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas as a carrier gas, the semiconductor raw material gas and the dopant gas controlled individually and precisely by MFC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, respectively, but the gases are mixed after the individual control and introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a process gas having the raw material gas and the dopant gas of respective constant concentrations with almost no diffusion in a width direction through the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>disposed in a width direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The process gas introduced into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes over the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed horizontally on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotating about the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a center in one direction and in almost parallel to the main surface. During the passage over the main surface, a chemical reaction arises to grow the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in vapor phase on the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a case where a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was formed on the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the conventional horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> as described above, and when the diameter of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was 200 mm or less, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed on the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was almost uniform. However, when a diameter of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was larger than 200 mm, for example the diameter of as large as 300 mm, a conspicuous non-uniformity occurred in a resistivity distribution along a diameter direction of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. That is, a resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a diameter of 300 mm was sharply reduced compared with the central portion other than an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The sharp reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is estimated to be caused by the so-called auto-doping phenomenon. Here, the auto-doping phenomenon will be explained below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is grown in vapor phase on the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an impurity added originally in the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is released into the reaction atmosphere through etching by H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas in the reaction atmosphere, occurring on a rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> heated at a high temperature and works as a dopant gas. The dopant gas generated from the rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is migrated along the side surface of the silicon single crystal substrate, further comes onto the front main surface to be incorporated into the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> during vapor phase growth. In such a way, since the dopant gas produced on the rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supplied into the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in addition to a dopant gas introduced intentionally from a gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an impurity more than necessary is added and thereby a resistivity of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is forcibly reduced lower than a target value. Since a concentration of the dopant gas, around the silicon single crystal substrate, produced on the rear main surface, migrated along the side surface and coming onto the front main surface is highest at the outer peripheral portion and reduced toward the central portion, a sharp reduction in resistivity occurs in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Such an auto-doping phenomenon occurs theoretically independent of a size of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Actually, however, in a conventional case where a diameter of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was less than 200 mm, reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, caused by the auto-doping phenomenon was not conspicuous, so that a resistivity distribution across the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> fell within an allowable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When this inventor used a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of 300 mm in diameter and a low resistivity to carry out vapor phase growth on a main surface thereof in order to respond to a recent demand for a semiconductor wafer of a large diameter, the inventor experienced a sharp reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> due to the auto-doping phenomenon, with the result that a problem became obvious since there arose a conspicuous non-uniformity in a resistivity distribution along a diameter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it has been known, as means suppressing occurrence of the auto-doping phenomenon, that a film made of silicon nitride or silicon oxide is formed on a rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this method, however, there is a fear that a film for prevention of an auto-doping phenomenon formed on the rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes a particle generation source and/or a metal contamination source, which entails a problem of a quality of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed on the front main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being degraded. In this method, in addition to an extra step of forming an auto-doping preventive film on the rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, another extra step of removing the auto-doping preventive film after forming the auto-doping preventive film becomes necessary, which produces a problem of reduction in productivity and increase in production cost combined. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention has been made in light of the above described problems and it is accordingly an object of the invention to provide not only a semiconductor wafer obtained by forming a semiconductor thin film having a uniform resistivity distribution on a main surface of a large diameter silicon single crystal substrate of 300 mm or more in diameter, but a production method for a semiconductor wafer by which a semiconductor thin film having a uniform resistivity distribution is formed on a front main surface of a large diameter semiconductor single crystal substrate of 300 mm or more in diameter without forming an auto-doping preventive film on the rear main surface thereof. The above described task is achieved by a semiconductor wafer and a production method therefor relating to the invention described below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> That is, a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention is characterized by that the semiconductor wafer has a construction in which a semiconductor thin film of 8% or less in resistivity distribution along a diameter is formed on a p-type semiconductor single crystal substrate of a diameter ranging from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, and a resistivity ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included. Here, a value representing a resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film, that is, 8% or less is calculated by the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(Maximum resistivity&minus;Minimum resistivity)/average resistivity over all measurement points&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, in a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a semiconductor thin film of 8% or less in resistivity distribution along a diameter is formed on a main surface even of a p-type semiconductor single crystal substrate as large as from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, in diameter and as low as from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included, in resistivity, and thereby a large diameter and a uniform resistivity distribution as characteristics of a recent semiconductor wafer are both achieved, which contributes largely to increase in throughput and yield of semiconductor chips in production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that in a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film formed on a main surface of a p-type semiconductor single crystal substrate is within &plusmn;4% or less. Here, a value representing a resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film, that is, &plusmn;4% or less is calculated by the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(Maximum resistivity&minus;Minimum resistivity)/(Maximum resistivity&plus;Minimum resistivity)&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this case, uniformity in resistivity distribution required for a recent semiconductor wafer is achieved with a high accuracy, thus further contributing to increase in yield of semiconductor chips in production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, in a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a diameter of the semiconductor single crystal substrate is preferably 300 mm. At the present stage, since a semiconductor single crystal substrate with a diameter up to 300 mm can be produced in a stable manner with high quality, it is practically enjoyed to an full extent that a resistivity distribution of a semiconductor thin film along a diameter is achieved with uniformity of 8% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (1)) or within &plusmn;4% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (2)) on a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate as low as from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included, in resistivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a semiconductor single crystal substrate is a silicon single crystal substrate and a semiconductor thin film is a silicon single crystal thin film. That is, since a large diameter and a uniform resistivity distribution as characteristics of a silicon single crystal wafer, which is a main stream of currently used semiconductor wafers, are both achieved, there arises expectation of a wide application of the silicon single crystal wafer in various aspects in fabrication of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further, in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied through a plurality of gas inlet ports disposed in a width direction of the reaction chamber onto a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate rotating in a reaction chamber in one direction in almost parallel to the main surface thereof to grow a semiconductor thin film on the main surface thereof in vapor phase and a dopant gas is supplied from gas inlet ports in the inner side among the plurality of gas inlet ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, in a production method of a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied through the plurality of gas inlet ports disposed in a width direction of the reaction chamber onto a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate in one direction in almost parallel to the main surface thereof and a dopant gas is supplied from gas inlet ports in the inner side among the plurality of gas inlet ports, that is, without supplying the dopant gas from gas inlet ports in the outer side among the plurality of gas inlet ports, with the result that a concentration of the dopant gas supplied into the vicinity of the outer periphery of the main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate is lower than that supplied into the central portion other than an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery on a relative basis. In this situation, however, a dopant gas produced on a rear main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate, migrating along the side surface thereof and coming onto the front main surface thereof is supplied in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof by the auto-doping phenomenon. For this reason, a dopant gas supplied from the gas inlet ports and a dopant gas supplied by the auto-doping phenomenon are combined and thereby, a concentration of the combined dopant gas supplied onto the front main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate can be almost uniform across the whole of the front main surface. As a result, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the front main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate can be more uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, the plurality of gas inlet ports are preferably composed of three kinds: an inner inlet port disposed at the innermost side in a width direction of a reaction chamber, an outer inlet port disposed at the outermost side in the width direction thereof and a middle inlet ports disposed between the inner inlet port and the outer inlet port and gas inlet ports disposed in the inner side among the plurality of gas inlet ports include the inner inlet port and the middle inlet port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, the plurality of gas inlet ports include the three kinds of the inner gas inlet port, the outer gas inlet port and the middle gas inlet port and, on an imaginary central axis along a width direction of the reaction chamber, passing through the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate, a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied onto an area in the vicinity of the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate from the inner gas inlet port, onto an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof from the outer gas inlet port and onto an intermediate area between the area in the vicinity of the center and the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery from the middle gas inlet port, while a dopant gas is not supplied from the outer gas inlet port but from the inner and middle gas inlet ports. In this situation, since while a concentration of a dopant gas supplied in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate is lower than those of the dopant gas supplied to the area in the vicinity of the central portion and the intermediate area on a relative basis, an additional dopant gas produced by the auto-doping phenomenon is supplied to the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery, therefore a concentration of the combined dopant gas supplied to across all the main surface of the semiconductor substrate is almost uniform. Accordingly, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate becomes more uniform with no need to provide an extra step of forming an auto-doping protective film on the rear main surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while description is made of the case where among the plurality of gas inlet ports disposed in a width direction of a reaction chamber, two kinds of inner and middle gas inlet ports are provided as gas inlet ports disposed in the inner side of the plurality of gas inlet ports for supply of a dopant gas, three or more kinds of gas inlet ports can also be provided as the gas inlet ports disposed in the inner side thereof for supply of a dopant gas according to a size of a semiconductor single crystal substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, it is further preferable that dopant gas rates supplied from the inner and middle inlet ports are individually controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In such a manner, since in a production method for a semiconductor wafer, dopant gas rates supplied onto the area in the vicinity of the center and the intermediate area of a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate other than the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof are individually controlled on an imaginary central axis along a width direction of the reaction chamber, passing through the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate, therefore concentrations of a dopant gas supplied onto the area in the vicinity of the center and the intermediate area can be closer in magnitude to each other, resulting in more uniform resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, it is preferable that as a semiconductor single crystal substrate, there is used a p-type semiconductor single crystal substrate of a diameter ranging from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, and especially a diameter of 300 mm and of a resistivity ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> That is, since in a case where a semiconductor single crystal substrate is of a diameter in the range of from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, and among them, especially, a diameter of 300 mm, a semiconductor single crystal substrate of which can be produced in a stable manner with high quality at the present stage, reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal thin film caused by the auto-doping phenomenon becomes conspicuous, therefore stoppage of dopant gas supply onto an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery from a gas inlet port exerts practically a sufficient influence to make a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor thin film uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a diameter of a semiconductor single crystal substrate is not limited to the range of from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, but a diameter beyond 400 mm thereof can be still used in the production method. In this case, as described above, a measure is conceived in which three or more kinds of gas inlet ports are provided as gas inlet ports in the inner side for supply of a dopant gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, in a case where a semiconductor single crystal substrate of a low resistivity lower than 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm is used, since an influence of the auto-doping phenomenon increases and reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal thin film caused by an increased influence is too sharp, simple stoppage of supply of a dopant gas onto area in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the semiconductor single crystal thin film from a gas inlet port is hard to exert a sufficient effect to make a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor single crystal thin film uniform. On the other hand, in a case where a high resistivity semiconductor single crystal substrate of a resistivity higher than 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm is used, since an influence of the auto-doping phenomenon decreases and reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal thin film caused by the influence thereof becomes small, there arises no need for stoppage of supply of a dopant gas on to the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery from a gas inlet port, but depending on circumstances, stoppage of supply of a dopant gas onto the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery, to the contrary, has a risk to induce non-uniformity in resistivity distribution across all the semiconductor single crystal thin film. Therefore, in a case of a resistivity of a semiconductor single crystal substrate ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included, stoppage of supply of a dopant gas onto an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the substrate from a gas inlet port works most effectively to make a resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, in a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, it is preferable that a semiconductor single crystal substrate is a silicon single crystal substrate and a semiconductor thin film is a silicon single crystal thin film. That is, a large diameter and a uniform resistivity distribution of a silicon single crystal wafer that is currently a main stream of semiconductor wafers are both achieved and thereby, a wide application of the silicon single crystal wafer in various aspects are expected in fabrication of semiconductor devices.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Description will be made of an embodiment of the invention below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

It should be noted that since a sectional view in a vertical plane showing the horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus used in a production method for a semiconductor wafer in a simplified manner, relating to an embodiment of the invention is basically similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, therefore <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is used in description thereof and the sectional view in a vertical plane of the horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus is not shown. Further, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the same constituents as those of the conventional horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> are represented by the same marks as those corresponding in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> and descriptions thereof are omitted or simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, in a horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus used in a production method for a semiconductor wafer, relating to this embodiment, a susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on which a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is horizontally placed is disposed at the bottom of the middle portion of a transparent quartz glass reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> installed along a horizontal direction and the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is coupled with a rotation device (not shown) through a rotary shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.

With this construction, a flow of a gas which is introduced through the gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and discharged through the gas outlet port <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the outside passes over a main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along a length direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, the gas inlet port <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed of six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>spread in a width direction of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It should be here noted that as a semiconductor raw material gas, there is employed, for example, Si-containing gas, such as SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(tetrachlorosilane) gas, SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(dichlorosilane) gas, SiHCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(trichlorosilane) gas or SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(monosilane) gas, while as a dopant gas, there is employed, for example, B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(diborane) gas, PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(phosphine) gas or the like gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Further, outside of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, there is disposed an infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for example, as a heat source heating the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed horizontally on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to raise a temperature of the main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a predetermined value. In addition, cooling means (not shown) for cooling the infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an outer wall of the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, description will be made of a method for forming a silicon single crystal thin film on a main surface of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the horizontal, single wafer vapor phase growth apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

Following the placement of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas is supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a gas source of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas through MFC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the common gas pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to substitute for a previous atmosphere in the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is clockwise rotated as shown by arrow marks in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference> by the rotation unit through the rotary shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being kept horizontally on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. With the infrared radiation lamp <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, heating is effected on the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the susceptor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to a predetermined temperature programme to raise a temperature at a main surface thereof to a predetermined set temperature. Following the heating power adjustment, a main surface temperature of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled according to the predetermined temperature programme and in the vapor phase growth step, not only is a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a gas source of the semiconductor raw material gas through MFC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the common gas pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the six inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, respectively, but a dopant gas is also supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a gas source of the dopant gas through MFC <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the common gas pipes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the four inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A SCP (Surface Charge Profiler) device of a QC Solutions CO. located at Woburn, Mass., USA was employed in measurement of the resistivity.

That is, first, a sample wafer is heated at about 300&deg; C. for a short time such that an electric charge in a natural oxide film formed on a surface of the sample wafer becomes constant and the sample wafer surface is then illuminated with light of 450 nm in a wavelength emitted from a GaN (Gallium nitride) LED (Light Emitting Diode) in pulses of about 40 Hz in frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Minority carriers excited by the incident light at a penetration depth of about 0.4 &mgr;m causes a change in potential at the sample wafer surface and this potential change is sensed as an SPV signal.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was formed on a main surface of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a conventional vapor phase growth apparatus in the above described conditions and a resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was measured at spatial intervals of 10 mm along a diameter and a result as shown in a graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> was obtained. Then, comparison is conducted on the results shown in the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the example and of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the comparative example with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> First, when comparing the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> directly with each other, it is clear that, although reduction in resistivity was observed in the vicinity of each of the outer peripheries of silicon single crystal thin films <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in both cases, a reduction in resistivity in the example was sufficiently smaller than that in the comparative example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The reason is that since B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas was supplied at a flow rate of 200 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/min through the outer inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>onto an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the comparative example and in addition to this, a dopant released by the auto-doping phenomenon from the rear main surface of the low resistivity silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> added with B at a high concentration was additionally supplied onto the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, therefore reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> became extremely large in ratio, while since in the example, only a dopant generated by the auto-doping phenomenon is incorporated into the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and no B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas was from the outer inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is supplied, reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is, if any, small on a relative basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Further, between the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, comparison in terms of a numerical value goes as follows: that is, in the above example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an average resistivity value over all measurement points of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is 2.23 &OHgr;&middot;cm, which is very close to a target resistivity value of 2.2 &OHgr;&middot;cm. Further, when calculating a resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> using the above described formula (1), the maximum resistivity is 2.32 &OHgr;&middot;cm and the minimum resistivity is 2.15 &OHgr;&middot;cm, thereby resulting in a resistivity distribution of 7.7%, and satisfying a target value of a resistivity distribution of 8% or less. Further, when calculating a resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> using the above described formula (2), a resistivity distribution is &plusmn;3.8% , which satisfies a target value of a resistivity distribution of &plusmn;4.0% or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the comparative example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an average resistivity over all measurement points of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is 6.39 &OHgr;&middot;cm. Further, a resistivity distribution in the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is 57.9% (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (1)) or &plusmn;35.0% (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (2)), which exceeds the target value of 8% or &plusmn;4.0% in great excess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As described above, from the comparison of the example and the comparative example with each other, it was recognized that even when a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was grown in vapor phase on a main surface of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as large as 300 mm &plusmn;0.2 mm in diameter, uniformity of a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was able to be sufficiently improved compared with a conventional practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that it was cleared that when the inventor repeated experiments changing various conditions including ones other than the conditions in consideration in the above described example, resistivity distributions of silicon single crystal thin films <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> fluctuated more or less according to concentrations of a semiconductor raw material gas and a dopant gas supplied into the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a reaction temperature. However, when a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the above described embodiment was applied and a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was grown in vapor phase on a main surface of a low resistivity silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of 300 mm in diameter, then a resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was be able to be easily controlled within 8% or less, both limits being included, (in the case of the above described formula (1)) or &plusmn;4.0% or less (in the case of the above described formula (2)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Even when a diameter of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ranged from 300 mm to 400 mm, both limits being included, similar to the above, a resistivity distribution of a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> grown in vapor phase on a main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was able to be easily controlled to be 8% or less (in the case of the above described formula (1)) or within &plusmn;4.0% or less (in the case of the above described formula (2)). To be described further, while in a case where a diameter of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exceeds 400 mm, the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with sufficiently high quality is hard to be manufactured in a stable manner at the present stage, uniformity in a resistivity distribution along a diameter direction of a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed on a main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> However, as a resistivity of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes higher in a range beyond 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, an influence of the auto-doping phenomenon decreases and therefore, reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer purify of a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> decreases, which produced a case where there arose a need to supply a dopant gas through the outer inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>in order to attain a uniform resistivity distribution across all the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, when a resistivity of a silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lower than 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm, an influence of the autodoping phenomenon increases and therefore, even when supply of a dopant gas from the outer inlet ports <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>ceased to prevent reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from occurring, it became hard for a resistivity distribution of the silicon single crystal thin film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be suppressed to be 8% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (1)) or within &plusmn;4% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (2)). Therefore, an auto-doping preventive film was necessary to be formed on the rear main surface of the silicon single crystal substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to a semiconductor wafer and a production method therefor, relating to the invention, the following effects can be exerted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> That is, a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention has a construction in which a semiconductor single crystal substrate as large as in the range of from 300 mm to 400 mm in diameter, both limits being included, and of a resistivity ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included, is used to form a semiconductor thin film of a resistivity distribution along a diameter of 8% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (1)) or within &plusmn;4% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (2)) on a main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate. Since with a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, a large diameter and uniform resistivity which semiconductor wafers used in recent years require are simultaneously achieved, the semiconductor wafer greatly contributes to improvement on increase in throughput and yield in fabrication of semiconductor chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Further, according to a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, the semiconductor wafer has a construction in which a semiconductor thin film of a resistivity distribution along a diameter of 8% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (1)) or within &plusmn;4% or less (in a case of calculation with the above described formula (2)) is formed on a main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate as large as in the range of from 300 mm to 400 mm in diameter, both limits being included, of a resistivity ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included, and thereby, a large diameter and uniform resistivity which semiconductor wafers used in recent years requires are simultaneously achieved, so that the semiconductor wafer greatly contributes to improvement on increase in throughput and yield in fabrication of semiconductor chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, when a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied through a plurality of gas inlet ports disposed in a width direction of a reaction chamber onto a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate in the reaction chamber in one direction in almost parallel to the main surface thereof, a dopant gas is supplied from gas inlet ports in the inner side among the plurality of gas inlet ports, that is, without supplying the dopant gas from gas inlet ports in the outer side among the plurality of gas inlet ports. Thereby, a dopant gas supplied through gas inlet ports and an additional dopant gas supplied by the auto-doping phenomenon are combined and a concentration of the combined dopant gas supplied to across all the main surface of the semiconductor substrate is almost uniform. Therefore, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate is enabled to be more uniform with no need to provide an extra step of forming an auto-doping protective film on the rear main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Further, according to a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, the plurality of gas inlet ports include the three kinds of the inner gas inlet port, the outer gas inlet port and the middle gas inlet port and, on an imaginary central axis along a width direction of the reaction chamber, passing through the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate, a semiconductor raw material gas is supplied onto an area in the vicinity of the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate from the inner gas inlet port, onto an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof from the outer gas inlet port and onto an intermediate area between the area in the vicinity of the center and the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery from the middle gas inlet port, while a dopant gas is not supplied from the outer gas inlet port but from the inner and middle gas inlet ports. In this situation, since a dopant gas supplied onto the area in the vicinity of the center of the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate and the intermediate area thereof, and a dopant gas supplied onto the area in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the main surface thereof by the auto-doping phenomenon can be combined to make a concentration of the combined dopant gas supplied to over all the main surface thereof almost uniform, therefore, a resistivity distribution along a diameter of the semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the main surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate is enabled to be more uniform with no need to provide an extra step of forming an auto-doping protective film on the rear main, surface of the semiconductor single crystal substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, according to a production method for a semiconductor wafer relating to the invention, on an imaginary central axis along a width direction of a reaction chamber, passing through the center of a main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate, amounts of a dopant gas supplied onto an area in the vicinity of the center and the intermediate area, of-the main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate other than an area in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof are individually controlled and thereby, concentrations of the dopant gas supplied onto the central portion and the intermediate area can be uniform, so that uniformity of resistivity distribution along a diameter of a semiconductor thin film grown in vapor phase on the main surface of a semiconductor single crystal substrate can be further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while sharp reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal thin film occurs conspicuously in a case of a semiconductor single crystal substrate as large as 300 mm or more in diameter and further, excessively sharp reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal thin film is caused in a case of a semiconductor single crystal substrate as low as 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm or less in resistivity by the auto-doping phenomenon, on the other hand, reduction in resistivity in the vicinity of the outer periphery of a semiconductor single crystal substrate caused by the auto-doping phenomenon is small in a case of a semiconductor single crystal substrate as high as 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm or more in resistivity. Hence, the above described effects can be sufficiently exerted in a case where a semiconductor single crystal substrate of a diameter of 300 mm or more and a resistivity ranging from 0.01 &OHgr;&middot;cm to 0.02 &OHgr;&middot;cm, both limits being included is used. </paragraph>
