<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a surface-type light amplifier device usable as a surface light emitting laser etc. when a resonator is disposed outside the device and to a method for the manufacture thereof. The &ldquo;surface-type&rdquo; light amplifier device referred to herein is a device comprising a light function portion for amplifying and emitting light and a substrate for physically supporting the light amplification function portion, wherein the emitted light rises with a specific angle relative to the surface of the substrate, generally in the direction of intersecting the substrate surface at right angles (in the normal direction). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As for surface-type light amplifier devices of this type, there is the one disclosed in Reference Literature 1: &ldquo;Electrically pumped mode-locked vertical-cavity semiconductor lasers&rdquo; (W. Jiang, M. Shimizu, R. P. Mirin, T. E. Reynolds and J. E. Bowers, Optics Letters, Vol. 18, No. 22, pp. 1937-1939, 1993). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the prior art surface-type light amplifier device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> structurally comprises an n-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on which a multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, an n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, an n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a p-type AlGaAs layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a p-type GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are deposited in the order mentioned. The p-type AlGaAs layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and p-type GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are partially cut off into a shape having a shape having a predetermined surface area. An antireflection coating <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is deposited onto the top surface of the p-type GaAs contact layer. A surface electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed on the p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, with an insulating film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sandwiched therebetween, so as to surround the cut-off portions and come into contact with the top peripheral part of the p-type GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A substrate electrode <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is deposited on the bottom surface of the n-type substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Injection of carriers into the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is attained by current injection, i.e. by applying voltage between the surface electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the substrate electrode <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Holes are injected from the surface electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sequentially via the p-type GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, p-type AlGaAs layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and p-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Electrons are injected from the substrate electrode <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> into the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sequentially via the n-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When the prior art device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used as a light amplifier device or particularly as a surface-emitting laser, the associated resonator comprises the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> built in the device and an external reflecting mirror (not shown). Between the external reflecting mirror not shown and the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> there is generally disposed a lens (not shown). It goes without saying that the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is used for reducing the resonator loss and obtaining the light gain. For the same reason, the layers <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are subjected to treatments such as for suppressing the impurity concentration etc. to a low degree so that the optical absorption loss can be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another prior art surface-type light amplifier device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. This device is disclosed in Reference Literature 2: &ldquo;High single-transverse-mode output from external-cavity surface-emitting laser diode&rdquo; (M. A. Hadley, G. C. Wilson, K. Y. Lau and J. S. Smith, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 63, No. 12, pp. 1607-1609, 1993) and comprises a GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> not of n-type but of p-type, on which a multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of p-type semiconductor, a p-type multi-quantum well active region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of n-type semiconductor are deposited in the order mentioned. Voltage is applied between a substrate electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> deposited on the bottom surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a bonding pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> disposed on an insulating film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and brought into contact with the top peripheral surface of the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to inject an electric current (carriers) into the multi-quantum well active region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining excited light. Holes are injected from the side of the substrate electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> into the multi-quantum well active layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> via the p-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the multilayer reflecting mirror of p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, whereas electrons are injected thereinto from the opposite side, i.e. from the bonding pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, via the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is, by nature, not a device for an external resonator. However, in the case that a resonator is composed only of the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the multilayer reflecting mirror of p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> embedded in the device, it inevitably poses a substantial problem that the transverse mode does not become a single lobe when the diameter of the device is made large. In order to solve the problem it is necessary to provide an external reflecting mirror not shown. Single-lobe beams can be obtained by deliberately lowering the reflecttivity of the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, then providing a suitable reflecting mirror outside the device on the side of the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and adjusting the position of a lens disposed in an optical path toward the external reflecting mirror, for example. In any event, the resonator has a composite construction comprising a first resonator composed of the multilayer reflecting mirror of p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> which are provided in the device and a second resonator composed of the multilayer reflecting mirror of p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the external reflecting mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, it is particularly difficult to obtain laser beams having a large diameter. This is because, if the effective area of the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, i.e. the area coated with the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and actually contributing to oscillation, is made large for enlarging the device diameter, it will become impossible to uniformly inject holes into that area. This results solely from the fact that each of the p-type semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has high electrical resistance. In order to inject holes into the neighborhood of the center of the effective area of the n-type GaAs active layer, it is necessary to cause the holes first to flow through the p-type semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the in-plane direction from the surface electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in contact with the peripheral edge of the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and then to be injected into the center of the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In the actual course of operation, however, this cannot be attained because the majority of holes are injected into the peripheral edge of the p-type GaAs contact layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from the surface electrode <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and then advance straightforward without being well spread laterally and reach the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to actually secure the state of uniform hole injection into the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the conventional device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> fabricated in accordance with such structural principle, it is required to reduce the diameter of the effective area of the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to not more than tens of &mgr;m. That is to say, when a large output power is required, it is necessary to adopt a method of arraying a plurality of devices, resulting in sacrifices of singleness and uniformity of optical beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the conventional device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, however, since holes can be injected from the substrate electrode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in surface contact with the back surface of the p-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the uniformity in the in-plane distribution of holes injected into the p-type multi-quantum well active region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> will be satisfied. However, the serious problem is that the device has a composite resonator structure which cannot constitute a pure external resonator type surface light emitting laser and since the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> incorporated in the device generally has a reflectance of not less than about 80%, the device is not suitable as a surface-type light amplifier device. In addition, due to the composite resonator structure, light pulses cannot be generated in the mode-locking operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a resistance lower than that of a p-type one is used for the sake of electron flow in the in-plane direction, the structure is designed for injecting electrons into the neighborhood of the center of the multi-quantum well active region <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. However, if the diameter of the multi-quantum well active area <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is set larger, the electrical resistance of the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> cannot be ignored and unevenness in the current injection is induced. That is to say, for uniform current injection, the upper limit of the effective area of the multi-quantum well active area <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is about 100 &mgr; in diameter though it is larger than that of the conventional device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In particular, it is impossible to control the injection of holes into the active layer because the p-type electrode is the substrate electrode and an electric current is injected through the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been proposed in view of the problems mentioned above, and its object is to provide a surface-type light amplifier device having at least a light amplification section including a structure of an active layer sandwiched between p-type and n-type cladding layers and emitting a light beam in the direction rising with a specific angle (generally, 90&deg; as stated above) relative to the surface of a support substrate, wherein the amplification of a single and uniform light beam or, if required, a large-diameter light beam, and the laser oscillation can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The inventor believes that, in the final analysis, the various drawbacks of the conventional devices <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> result from the presence per se of the n-type substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or the p-type substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> forming the light amplification section contributing to the light amplification, namely, the multilayer structure including the semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or the multilayer structure including the semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It goes without saying that the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is indispensable to the formation of the light amplification section and important even after the section has been formed as a support for securing the physical strength of the device. Insofar as the light amplifying function is concerned, however, the substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are rather unnecessary or obstructive. Since the substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> generally have a large thickness of up to hundreds of &mgr;m, when a compound semiconductor substrate such as a GaAs substrate is employed, loss in passing amplified light therethrough is very large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For this reason, both the conventional devices <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> have a construction such that amplified light is not passed through the support substrates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. This is the same in other conventional devices not touched upon here. In other words, various changes in construction for improving the characteristics of devices have heretofore had to be made on the major premise that light should not be passed through a substrate. This has brought about various restrictions. In the case of the conventional device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, since the light emitted from the light amplification portion has to be emitted from the side of the p-type semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> opposite the side at which the n-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is present, this light emitting surface cannot be covered by the electrode. As a result, an electric current has to be applied only through the peripheral edge of the p-type AlGaAs layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to the the p-type cladding layer and then to the n-type GaAs active layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as described above, thereby inducing the aforementioned uneven hole injection and difficulty in achieving a large device diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the case of the conventional device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the p-type GaAs substrate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is used in place of the n-type GaAs substrate, with the result that there is an advantage that the multilayer reflecting mirror of n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be disposed on the side opposite the side at which the substrate is present to achieve low resistance, but there are restrictions, such as requiring a composite resonance structure, resulting in the different drawbacks as described above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, the present inventor, exploding the well-established concept, has conceived the idea of removing a base substrate used for fabricating a light amplification section after the fabrication of the light amplification section. However, since the light amplification section is an extremely thin structure, such mere removal of the base substrate would decrease the strength of the light amplification section resulting in physical distortion producing optical distortion, and would not allow the light amplification section to be put into practical use. Therefore, the present invention provides a structure having the light amplification section attached to a transparent support substrate that is separate from the base substrate used in fabricating the light amplification section and exhibits a low loss when a light beam passes therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With this device structure, a light beam amplified at the light amplification section can be passed through the transparent substrate. This means that there arises a degree of freedom in structural design. For example, an electrode through which holes are injected into a p-type semiconductor layer with relatively high resistance can be made large. Furthermore, even when a plurality of divided electrodes are formed and a light beam is prevented from being emitted from the side of these electrodes as in the specific embodiment of the present invention which will be described later, various improvements can be realized by enabling a light beam to be emitted via the transparent substrate provided on the opposite side of the electrodes with the active layer of the light amplification section therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a surface-type light amplifier device, as a preferred unsophisticated embodiment satisfying the above fundamental conditions, having a light amplification section attached to a transparent substrate on the side on which an n-type semiconductor layer is present and having a plurality of divided electrodes provided on the side across an active layer opposite the n-type semiconductor layer for injecting holes into a p-type semiconductor layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this surface-type light amplifier device, it is possible to uniformly inject holes into the p-type semiconductor layer having higher resistance than an n-type one. In addition, since the in-plane distribution of the carriers in the active layer can be controlled by controlling the amount of an electric current applied to the divided electrodes, it is possible to control the in-plane distribution to conform to the light intensity distribution in the fundamental mode having a single lobe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, as a more concrete unsophisticated embodiment, a surface-type light amplifier device wherein an active layer in a light amplification section is sandwiched between an n-type semiconductor cladding layer that is an n-type semiconductor layer and a p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror that is a p-type semiconductor layer; the light amplification section is attached to a transparent substrate on the side of the n-type semiconductor cladding layer; a plurality of divided electrodes attain electric continuity through a p-type cap layer provided on the p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror; and an electrode forming electrical continuity relative to the n-type semiconductor cladding layer is connected to a wiring conductor provided on the transparent substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method for fabricating a surface-type light amplifier device, which includes the steps of forming a light amplification section on a structural substrate for the formation of that section, attaching a different transparent substrate to the exposed surface of the light amplification section, and removing the structural substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As an unsophisticated embodiment of the aforementioned fabrication method, the present invention provides a fabrication method comprising the steps of successively forming a p-type semiconductor layer, an active layer and an n-type semiconductor layer in the order mentioned on the structural substrate, attaching the transparent substrate to the exposed surface of the n-type semiconductor layer, and forming a plurality of divided electrodes on the surface of the p-type semiconductor layer exposed after the removal of the structural substrate, thereby attaining electrical continuity relative to the p-type semiconductor layer.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) shows a schematic configuration of one example of surface-type light amplifier device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fabricated in accordance with the present invention. In the present invention, a light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including a structure of sandwiching between p-type and n-type semiconductor layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> an active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that produces excited carriers is attached by means of a transparent adhesive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that differs from a structural substrate on which the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been formed. That is to say, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) shows the state in which the structural substrate has been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention thus configured, since a light beam produced at the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can pass through the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the degree of freedom for constructional improvements in this section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> increases. As described below, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) discloses the configuration in one preferred unsophisticated embodiment in accordance with the present invention. However, there can be provided other various surface-type light amplifier devices in accordance with the fundamental construction of the present invention. The material for the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be glass, plastic, etc. having very high transparency with respect to the oscillation wavelength. From these materials can be easily obtained one having transmittance of 99 to 99.9% with respect to transmission beams in the optical wavelength range. It is noted, however, that the larger the thickness, the larger the transmission loss even when the transmission is markedly high. Generally, however, the thickness of the substrate that can physically support the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thereon and can ensure a strength thereof large enough to prevent the section from distortion falls in the range of hundreds of pm to several nun, in which range the transparency is fully satisfactory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As the transparent adhesive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> commercially available polyimide etc. can be used. Since such an adhesive agent has sufficiently high transmittance and is used in the form of a thin film, there arises no problem in use. Surface levelling (optical precision) of the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and uniform application of the transparent adhesive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be satisfactorily attained with ease using any prior art technology. In order to avoid diff-used reflection on the surface of the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the interface between the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the transparent adhesive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the interface between the transparent adhesive and the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, antireflection coatings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are applied beforehand to these faces. The antireflection coatings can be constituted of a double-layer laminate structure of TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the surface-type light amplifier device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A), the concrete construction of the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is as follows. Attached through the transparent adhesive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and antireflection coating <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is an n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that can be constituted, for example, of an n-type Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>As (x&equals;0.3) layer having a thickness of about 2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On that layer is formed an active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is the principal part of the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is constituted of a non-doped GaAs layer having a thickness of about 0.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> On the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed a p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is a p-type semiconductor layer and is constituted, for example, of a periodical repetition laminate structure of an Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>As (x&equals;0.1) layer and a p-type AlAs layer. Each layer has a considerably small thickness, and the total thickness of the structure is approximately several pm. However, since such a semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror per se is well known, it can be produced in accordance with an optional prior art technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from the fact that a semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used as a p-type semiconductor layer in the surface-type light amplifier device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A), the device has a structure such that a light beam produced at the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is reflected by the reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is radiated to an exterior space through the n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Therefore, unlike the conventional device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> relying on the composite resonator structure constructed together with a resonator built in the device, it is possible to provide a complete unit of external reflecting mirror type light emitting laser, though not shown, by disposing a commercially available high-performance reflecting mirror, e.g. a planar dielectric multilayer reflecting mirror having reflectivity of not less than 99%, in an exterior space on an extension of the emission path of the light beam while interposing a suitable lens between the device and the mirror, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order to produce excited carriers in the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, it is required to inject an electric current into the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The constitution for this requirement is as described hereinafter, wherein a particularly effective arrangement is adopted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> On the p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed a p-type GaAs cap layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a thickness of 3000 &angst; and doped with high-concentration Zn. The particularly effective arrangement is that a plurality of divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for hole injection are provided on the cap layer. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprise a disc-shaped electrode at the center and a plurality of ring-like electrodes concentric with the center electrode and arranged at prescribed intervals. With this structure, the in-plane distribution of holes injected from the electrodes into the active layer via the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be controlled to be uniform by controlling voltage applied to the individual electrodes, and active control can be made in the operation of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> That is to say, while, in the conventional device, the hole flow through a very thin p-type semiconductor layer with high resistance into an active layer is deviated, resulting in an obstacle to uniform hole injection, the structure shown in the drawing makes it possible not only to inject holes uniformly into the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, but also to control the injection current distribution more positively to obtain a gain distribution suitable for a light distribution of an oscillation mode etc. When a light distribution of the fundamental mode having a single lobe is to be obtained, for example, the amounts of an electric current to be injected into the electrodes are set higher toward the central electrode. It is further possible to obtain a stable and highly precise lasing light, a lasing light beam of a desired far-field pattern, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are not limited to the concentric ones as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but can optionally be selected from a pattern of strips arranged in parallel, a predetermined plane pattern of dots each of circular, rectangular shape or the like, and other patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the electrode for injecting electrons into the n-type semiconductor layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with relatively low resistance can be formed more simply. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> ring-like contact layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in contact with the bottom surface of the n-type semiconductor layer (cladding layer) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed along the outer periphery of the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed into a predetermined solid (cylindrical shape in the drawing) as a whole, and an electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of an alloy of AuGe or the like formed on the contact layer is electrically connected via an electrode connecting member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to a wiring conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> formed on the surface of the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> around the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The contact layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 1000 &angst; and can be constituted of an n-type GaAs layer, for example. The electrode connecting member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be constituted of a solder of In or AuSn. The wiring conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be constituted of Au or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As mentioned briefly earlier, when the device shown in the drawing is used as an external resonator type surface light emitting laser, a resonator can be constituted of the p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and an external reflecting mirror and a lens which are not shown in the drawing. The lens is disposed in an exterior space opposite the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the side of the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the external reflecting mirror is disposed on an extension of a line connecting the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the lens. That is to say, the surface-type device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed so that the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> faces the external reflecting mirror with the lens intervening therebetween. The device, lens and external reflecting mirror are placed on a fine-motion table capable of optical adjustment. The external reflecting mirror is a planar-type reflecting mirror that reflects light having an emission wavelength at sufficiently high reflectivity, e.g. a dielectric multilayer reflecting mirror having reflectivity of not less than 99%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The light reflected by the p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is amplified again in the area of the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, collimated by the lens, reflected again by the external reflecting mirror, and returned to the active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and to the p-type semiconductor reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This sequence is repeated to give rise to laser oscillation. At this time, an adjustment mechanism such as the fine-motion table is used to optically adjust the device, lens and external reflecting mirror so as to reduce resonator loss. The distance between the external reflecting mirror and the device, i.e. the external resonator length, is made sufficiently small. This is for avoiding the influence of vibration etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An electric current is applied to the divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to be matched with the light intensity distribution in the fundamental mode of single lobe, namely so that it flows mostly through the center electrode. By this, it is possible to realize an external resonator-type surface light emission laser with a large output. In addition, the electric current applied to the divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is suitably modulated for the round-trip time of light passing through the length of the external resonator, e.g. modulated at 1 GHz where the round-trip time of light is 1 ns, with the result that an active mode-locking operation is assumed to enable generation of light pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The surface-type light amplifier devices according to the present invention, inclusive of the one designated by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A), can be fabricated by various methods. However, a desirable process for fabricating the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A) can be exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(B). As shown at step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a commercially available GaAs substrate having a thickness of approximately 400 &mgr;m is used as a substrate for constructing a light amplification section, and on the substrate is formed an Al<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>As layer (x&equals;0.6) having a thickness of around 3000 &angst; that functions as an etching prevention layer in a subsequent etching step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> On the etching prevention layer is constructed the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(A), in an inverted state, as shown at step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> cannot be formed at this step. To be specific, the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, p-type semiconductor multilayer reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, active layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and contact layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are successively deposited in the order mentioned. The light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a predetermined three-dimensional shape such as a columnar shape is formed by using a deposition technique and lithography or a like technique together. Lithography is similarly utilized to remove part of the contact layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> present at the beam passageway and exhibiting a large optical loss. The antireflection coating <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is further formed when found necessary by using a coating technique and lithography together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown at subsequent step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, to the side of the n-type cladding layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exposed to the outside, namely to the side of the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> when formed, is attached a transparent substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, such as of glass, having a highly flat surface via the transparent adhesive of polyimide or the like applied uniformly onto that side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The physical strength of the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is thus secured beforehand so as not to induce any physical or optical distortion. The thus constructed structure is then subjected to a substrate polishing step. Since the substrate is as thick as about 400 &mgr;m as shown above, it is polished as shown at step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> using a mechanical polishing method so that the resultant thickness is approximately 30 to 100 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After the substrate has been polished to have such a thickness, it is etched at an appropriate temperature with a suitable solution, e.g. at about 20&deg; C. with a mixed solution of one part of ammonia and twenty parts of a hydrogen peroxide solution as shown at step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. When the aforementioned A<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>As layer (x&equals;0.6) has been formed as an etching prevention layer on the substrate, the substrate can be etched up to the etching prevention layer at high speed of about 20 &mgr;m/min without strictly managing the etching time, and it is possible to stop the etching. As the etching prevention layer, an AlAs layer or the like can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown at subsequent step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the etching prevention layer is removed by etching it with a mixed solution of phosphoric acid, a hydrogen peroxide solution and water (H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&equals;3:1:50) at about 20&deg; C. Since this etching is effected at a speed of about 1000 &angst;/min., the etching prevention layer can be easily removed under time management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the surface of the p-type cap layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been exposed to the outside, a predetermined number of divided electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for injection of holes are formed in a predetermined pattern of arrangement as shown at step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by depositing an alloy of AuZn or the like onto the entire surface of the cap layer and then effecting lithography, or by using a printing technique after a predetermined pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The electrical structural parts <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be formed on the n-type semiconductor layer (cladding layer) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> not described in detail herein above can be fabricated by a known method comprising suitable steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment has been described in the foregoing, any modification can be made therein insofar as it does not depart from the gist of the present invention. In addition to AlGaAs used as the material for the light amplification section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, InGaAsP, GaN, etc. that similarly fall under Group III&mdash;V semiconductors and photo-semiconductor materials such as ZnSe that fall under Group II&mdash;VI semiconductors can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the substrate used for constructing a light amplification section can be removed and since light can be transmitted through a transparent substrate, the degree of freedom with respect to improvements in the light amplification section increases to a great extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When an electrode for injection of holes to be provided on the side of a p-type semiconductor layer is composed of a plurality of divided electrodes in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amount of an electric current applied to each of the divided electrodes can be controlled to enable carrier distribution in an active layer to be actively controlled. As a consequence, it is possible to inject carriers in accordance with light intensity distribution in the fundamental mode having a single lobe when fabricating an external resonator-type surface light emitting laser to enable the operation in the fundamental mode to be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the side of the transparent substrate is used as a light emitting side, the p-type semiconductor functions as a multilayer reflecting mirror. For this reason, due to the optical stability of the p-type multilayer reflecting mirror obtained by fixing it to the transparent substrate, the range of effective active region can be enlarged to materialize a current injection-type external resonator-type surface light emitting laser with a large output, a light beam reflecting-type amplifier with a large diameter, etc. It is fully possible to achieve generation of a light beam having a diameter of several hundreds of &mgr;m or more. It goes without saying that since the surface-type light amplifier device of the present invention is of a current injection type, an external-resonator active-mode locking surface light emitting laser can be materialized. In this case, a high output of light pulses can be generated. </paragraph>
