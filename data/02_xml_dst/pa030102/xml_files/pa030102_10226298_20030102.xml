<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid-crystal projection device i.e. what is known as a projector and in particular relates to improvements in the light source and peripheral optical system of a small-size liquid-crystal projection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the light sources employed is conventional liquid-crystal projection devices, light sources using a fluorescent tube or light-guide plate or electrical discharge-type light sources such as metal halide lamps have come to be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In particular, Japanese Patent Laid-Open number Sho. 51-119243 discloses a flat plate-shaped light source. This specification states that the flat plate-shaped light source employs electroluminescence i.e. electroluminescent elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in the case of a light source employing a fluorescent tube or light-guide plate, it is difficult to make the diameter of the fluorescent tube etc. small. There was therefore the problem that miniaturization of a liquid-crystal projection device was difficult, since the thickness of the light source itself could not be reduced below the diameter of the fluorescent tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, in the case of an electric discharge-type light source such as a metal halide lamp, the reflector of large aperture that was considered necessary to direct the light diverging from the light source parallel to the liquid crystal panel was a factor impeding miniaturization of the liquid-crystal projection device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In particular in the case of a liquid-crystal projection device for color display, further miniaturization the liquid-crystal projection device was difficult owing to the need to provide liquid crystal display elements consisting of a light source as aforementioned and liquid crystal panel for each of the primary colors constituting the color image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, Japanese Patent Laid-Open number Sho. 51-119243 does not clearly disclose a material constituting a luminescent layer of an electroluminescent element. When the conventional inorganic electroluminescent material is employed as material for this luminescent layer, light from the electroluminescent element is light of a highly divergent character. This therefore suffered from the problem that projection of a bright image could not be achieved since the light could not be effectively directed into the aperture of the projection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further problem was that the drive voltage required for an eloctroluminescent element using inorganic material is at least 100 volts, which is comparatively high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, preferred embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (Layout) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A liquid projection device according to the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes a liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, projection lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Projection lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constituted such that an image emitted from liquid crystal element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is imaged on a screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Although only a single projection lens is shown in the Figure, this could of course be constituted by an assembly of a plurality of lenses. Specifically, the projection lens may be constructed so as to for example magnify the image emitted from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>before it is formed on screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Frame <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constituted as a receptacle for accommodating the entire liquid-crystal projection device and is constituted such that the optical elements are suitably arranged therein. Its material is constituted such that it is unaffected by deformation etc. due to heat emission by liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, includes an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is constructed to emit a modulated image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constituted of successive layers: transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, green luminescent layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, red luminescent layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and reflective electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on transparent substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Transparent substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> consists of optically transparent material such as glass and is constituted of material of high mechanical strength. Its thickness is adjusted so as not to be too thin, in order to maintain enough mechanical strength to act as a light source, yet not to be so thick as to result in loss of optical transparency or excessive weight. The area of this substrate is preferably slightly larger than the area of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It its area is too large, power is wasted in unused illumination and the contrast of the projected image is adversely affected by leakage of light. If the area is too small, sufficient illuminating light is not supplied to the peripheral section of the liquid crystal panel, producing non-uniformity of the amount of light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is constituted of a material having optical transparency such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and that has electrical conductivity. Its film thickness is adjusted so that it is not too thin for its film thickness to be kept uniform during manufacture yet is not so thick as to result in loss of optical transparency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, green luminescent layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and red luminescent layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are each constituted of organic thin-film layers containing organic molecules that emit light on application of an electrical field. Blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is constituted by organic molecules that emit light in the blue wavelength region. Green luminescent layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is constituted by organic molecules that emit light in the green wavelength region. Red luminescent layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is constituted by organic molecules that emit light in the red wavelength region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As blue electroluminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that emits light of blue color, there may be employed a laminated structure consisting of a triphenyldiamine derivative whose peak luminescence wavelength is about 380 to 420 nm and a 1,2,4-triazole derivative; as green luminescence layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> that emits light of green color, there may be employed aluminium tris (8-quinolilate) whose peak luminescence wavelength is about 520 nm; and as the red luminescence layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that emits light of red color, there may be employed aluminium tris (8-quinolinate) to which has been added red luminescent chromogenic material, whose peak luminescence wavelength is about 600 nm. These materials are disclosed in Science, Vol. 267 pp. 1332-1334 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Preferably the area of the luminescent layers is equal to that of the transparent electrode layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Reflective electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> maybe a metallic layer that reflects light and has electrical conductivity. Examples of such metals that may be used include magnesium-silver alloys etc. Its film thickness is adjusted such that the film thickness can be maintained uniform but does not provide excess weight. Its area is preferably the same as that of transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To simplify the description, the power source circuit that applies voltage between transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is not shown in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes polarizing plates <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, transparent substrate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. These constructional items are the same as in a commonly known transparent liquid crystal panel. In this Figure, in order to facilitate understanding, the drive circuitry provided on the transparent substrate and the display circuitry that supplies control signals to the transparent electrode, wiring and drive circuitry are not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Polarizing plates <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have the same construction and are constituted such as to transmit only light of a specified polarization condition of the incident light. However, the direction of polarization (direction of oscillation) of the light passing through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is arranged to be offset by a fixed angle with respect to the direction of polarization transmitted through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This angle is set so as to be equal to the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization so that liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> rotates the plane of polarization of light incident thereon when no voltage is applied to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a known twisted nematic liquid crystal or the like is employed; when voltage is applied to it it does not rotate the plane of polarization of incident light, but when voltage is not applied to it, it rotates the plane of polarization of incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Transparent substrate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is provide with a transparent electrode (not shown) on the liquid crystal layer side, and a drive circuit is provided that is capable of driving the liquid crystal for each pixel. The construction is such that optical modulation can be achieved by transmitting or not transmitting light from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in response to change of voltage of a control signal supplied from the drive circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Preferably, organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a cooling mechanism that cools the organic electroluminescent element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When an electrical field is applied to the electroluminescent element, this exhibits electroluminescence. When an electrical field is applied to a material that produces electroluminescence, the electroluminescence phenomenon is produced and the electrical energy is converted into light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as electroluminescent elements, the inorganic materials ZnS, SrS, and CaS were employed. However, with these inorganic materials, the intensity o the light is weak, and the emitted light is not emitted in parallel but constitutes divergent light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In contrast, with the electroluminescent element of the present invention, an organic material is employed. The amount of light emitted due to electroluminescence is large because of light emission due to recombination of electrons injected from the cathode and positive holes injected from the anode. Luminescent layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> constitute luminescent elements using this organic material. When voltage is applied between transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and reflective electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, an electrical field is generated corresponding to the film thickness of the luminescent layer and the applied voltage in each luminescent layer sandwiched by two electrode layers. The organic molecules of each luminescent layer exhibit the electroluminescence phenomenon when they are subjected to this electrical field and generate light in a fixed wavelength region. The intensity of this light is correlated with the applied voltage. Each luminescent layer has an electrical field applied to it which depends on the film thickness, so the luminescence depends on the intensity of the electrical field. If the areas of transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, luminescent layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and reflective electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are made practically equal, the intensities of the electrical fields in each portion of the luminescent layers are practically uniform. That is, uniform light is emitted from the entire surface of the organic electroluminescent element. The blue-colored light from blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passes directly through transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and is emitted from the transparent substrate. The green light from green luminescent layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> passes through blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and transparent electrode film <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to be emitted from the transparent substrate. The red light from red luminescent layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> passes through green luminescent layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, blue luminescent layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and transparent electrode film <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to be emitted from the transparent substrate. If the film thicknesses etc. of the luminescent layers are adjusted such that the same amount of light of each primary color is emitted from the transparent substrate, white light is obtained by equal summation of the primary colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Although light is also emitted from each luminescent layer in the opposite direction to the liquid crystal panel, this light is reflected by reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and returned towards liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the light that is returned from reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is added to the light that is directly emitted from each luminescent layer, resulting in an increased amount of light being emitted to outside transparent substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In particular, an organic electroluminescent element as employed in the present invention is well adapted as a light source for a liquid-crystal projection device, since it has the characteristic advantages of ability to be driven at low voltage and higher brightness than the inorganic electroluminescent elements that were conventionally employed as a flat plate-shaped light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, of the light from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, only light having a specified plane of polarization passes through polarising plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. When a control signal is supplied to the control circuit formed on transparent substrate <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, voltage is applied between the transparent electrodes of the pixel in question. In a pixel that has voltage applied between its transparent electrodes, the liquid crystal molecules in the region of this pixel are aligned in the direction of the electrical field. Consequently, in the case of a pixel that has voltage applied to it, rotation of the plane of polarization is not applied to incident light, and such light reaches polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the opposite side. However, the direction of polarization in which transmission is possible through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is offset from that of polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, so the incident light cannot pass through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if control voltage is not applied to the drive circuit, voltage is not applied between the electrodes of the pixel in question. In the case of a pixel to which voltage is not applied, the liquid crystal molecules in this pixel region are aligned in the horizontal direction, so rotation of the plane of polarization is applied to the incident light. Consequently, in the case of pixels to which voltage is not applied, rotation of the plane of polarization is applied to the incident light, and this therefore reaches polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the opposite side. Polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is arranged offset from polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization that is applied to this incident light, so the incident light passes through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and reaches screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through projection lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this way, display/non-display can be set up for each pixel by means of a control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display element is formed of a size of for example about 33 mm (1.3 inch) diagonal, and can be driven by a drive voltage of about 10 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain a construction in which a color image can be projected on to a screen, color filters are formed in the pixels of the liquid crystal panel. By such a construction, color can be generated when white light passes through the liquid crystal panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this embodiment 1, no large reflector needs to be employed for the light source, so that the display device can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Also, since the organic electroluminescent element supplies bright light to the liquid crystal panel, a liquid-crystal projection device can be provided in which a bright image is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 of the present invention provides an organic electroluminescent element in which white light is obtained by luminescent layers different from those embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> (Construction) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A liquid-crystal projection device according to embodiment 2 has the same construction (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) as embodiment 1 described above, except that liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>differs from embodiment 1 in that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it comprises an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The construction of liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is identical with that of the first embodiment so as description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is constituted by laminating a transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, white luminescent layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> on the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Transparent substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is the same as transparent substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is the same as transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is the same as reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, respectively, so description thereof is omitted. Depiction of the power source circuit for applying voltage between the transparent electrode layer and reflecting electrode layer is omitted just as in the case of embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> White luminescent layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is an organic thin-film layer which, when an electrical field is applied to it, emits light of a plurality of wavelength regions, so that white light is emitted from the layer as a whole. An example that may be given of an organic thin film that emits white light in response to application of an electrical field is a thin film in which there is a molecular dispersion of a low molecular electron transporting compound and a plurality of chromogenic materials constituting centers of luminescence in poly (N-vinyl carbazole) vinyl. Such a luminescent film structure is disclosed in Applied Physics Letters Vol. 67 No. 16, pp. 2281-2283 (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When voltage is applied between transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, an electrical field is generated corresponding to the film thickness of this white luminescent layer and the value of this voltage. While luminescent film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> emits simultaneously light of a plurality of primary color wavelength regions in response to the intensity of this electrical field; the light of this plurality of wavelength regions is summed and emitted from the transparent substrate. White light is therefore supplied to liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, although in this embodiment, a luminescent layer was constituted by an organic thin film emitting white light such that a color image could also be projected, it would alternatively be possible to provide as luminescent layer an organic thin film emitting a single color such as green, red or blue. In this case, an image of this single color is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, it would also be possible to provide a cooling mechanism for cooling the organic electroluminescent element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As described above, with embodiment 1, a large reflector is not employed, so the display device can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 3) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 3 of the present invention relates to an organic electroluminescent element whose directionality in the direction normal to the light-emitting face is strong due to an optical resonant structure and in which light of specified wavelength is emitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (Construction) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A liquid-crystal projection device according to embodiment 3 has the same construction as embodiment 1 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) except for liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>comprises an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is identical with that of embodiment 1, so further description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constituted by successive layers consisting of a transparent substrate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a spacing adjustment layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, a positive hole transport layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Transparent substrate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is the same as transparent substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is the same as transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is the same as reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of embodiment 1, respectively, so further description is omitted. Just as in embodiment 1, depiction of the power source circuitry for applying voltage between the transparent electrode layer and reflecting electrode layer is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is provide with dielectric multi-layer film and is constituted to function as a half mirror. Specifically, thanks to this multi-layer film structure, dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to transmit part of the incident light and to reflect the remainder. As such a dielectric, a stacked-layer construction of for example Tio<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(titanium oxide) and Sio<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(silicon oxide) may be employed. Regarding the film thickness, the number of stacked layer of dielectric multi-layer film and the film thickness of the dielectric films are determined in correspondence with the resonance wavelength such that about half of the incident light is reflected and the rest is transmitted. An optical resonator is constituted by the dielectric multi-layer film and reflecting electrode. Spacing adjustment layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is provided in order to adjust the distance between dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and is constituted of a transparent dielectric film such as Sio<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Also, if the film thickness of positive hole transport layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are set such as to satisfy the following conditions, this spacing adjustment layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> could be omitted. Positive hole transport layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is a layer for transporting positive holes to luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> when positive holes are injected from the anode constituted by transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and consists for example of a triphenyldiamine derivative. The gap constituted by spacing adjustment layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is adjusted such that the optical distance of dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> satisfies the condition of being an integral multiple of half wavelengths of the peak wavelength of the light emitted from this organic electroluminescent element. In order to obtain the desired color of emitted light, the organic electroluminescent element is constructed by adjusting the material of luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the resonator length of the resonator structure. For example, to constitute a luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that emits light in the green region, a luminescent layer is constructed using material such as aluminium tris (8-quinolilate). In this case, an organic electroluminescent element that emits light with a narrow-band luminescence spectrum in the green region, providing a peak wavelength of 540 nm width a half-value width of 60 nm can be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> To construct a luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that emits light in the red region, a luminescent layer may be constituted using a material in which a red fluorescence chromogenic material is dispersed in aluminium tris (8-quinolilate) and/or a europium (Eu) complex. In this case, a peak wavelength of about 610 nm may be obtained. A luminescent layer containing a europium complex is disclosed in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 34 pp. 1883-1887. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> To construct a luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that emits light in the blue region, a luminescent layer may be constituted using a material such as a distyrile biphenyl derivative. A technique of constituting a luminescent layer of a distyrile biphenyl derivative is disclosed in Oyo Butsuri Vol. 62, (No. 10), pp. 1016-1018 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Although in this embodiment a stacked-layer construction of luminescent layers and positive hole transport layer was employed, it would alternatively be possible to employ a stacked-layer construction of luminescent layers, positive hole transport layer and electron transport layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Also, it is desirable to provide a cooling mechanism in organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to cool the organic electroluminescent element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Further, separate provision of a filter that transmits light of the required wavelength and absorbs light of unrequired wavelengths on the emission side of light of the organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is desirable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> An organic electroluminescent element according to the present invention emits light of specified wavelength by utilizing the optical resonance effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When a prescribed voltage (for example about 10 volts) is applied between transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, an electric field is generated between the two electrode layers, and light is emitted from luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in accordance with the intensity of this electric field. Some of this light passes through dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> while the remainder is reflected. The reflected light is again reflected by reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and reaches dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. At dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, again some of the light is transmitted while the rest is reflected, so as the reflection of the light between the reflecting surface of dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is repeated, and what is known as optical resonance is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The wavelength of the resonating light depends on the optical distance between dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. If this optical distance satisfies the condition of being an integral multiple of the half wavelength of the emitted light, optical resonance is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Consequently, since, of the wavelengths contained in the light that is emitted form luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, light that does not satisfy this condition is suppressed, only light that satisfies the aforementioned condition passes through dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and is emitted. Consequently, the wavelength band of the luminescence spectrum is narrower than in the embodiment described above. That is, luminescence occurs with a specific color. This resonance effect is disclosed in detail in Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 68, (No. 19), p. 2633-2655 (1996), Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 65, (No. 15), p. 1868-1870 (1994) and in Electronic Information Communication Society Technical Research Reports (Denshi Joho Tsushin Gakkai Gijutsu Kenkyu Hokoku) OME 94-79 etc. Also, technical information concerning raising the directionality in the front-side direction of an organic electroluminescent element is contained in articles in Applied Physics Letters Vol. 63, (No. 15), p. 2023-2034 etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> With embodiment 3 as described above, an organic electroluminescent element that has strong directionality of the emitted light in the normal direction (front-side direction) of the organic electroluminescent element and in which light emission can be restricted to a specified wavelength can be provided without using a bulky light source such as a reflector; a liquid-crystal projection device can therefore be made of smaller size than conventionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Also, since the organic electroluminescent element is brighter than a conventional electroluminescent element, by manufacturing such elements for the respective primary colors for color display, and combining their images, a bright color image can be displayed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A liquid-crystal projection device according to embodiment 4 has practically the same construction as embodiment 1 described above (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) apart from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>comprises an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is of the same construction as in the case of embodiment 2 and transport liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is of the same construction as in embodiment 1, further description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of this embodiment could be directly substituted by organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described in embodiment 1 or organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described in embodiment 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Also, in these Figures, in order to make the Figures easier to view, organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown as being separated by a large spatial distance. In fact, in order to supply light from electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal panel in an efficient manner, these may be arranged adjacent each other without mutually intervening space or the gap between these elements may be filled with transparent material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be constructed comprising a quarter wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Cholestric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> constituted of cholesteric phase liquid crystal material; when light is directed on to this, circularly polarized light of a direction of rotation coincident with the helical direction of the cholesteric structure is reflected, whereas circularly polarized light rotating in the opposite direction to this helical direction is transmitted. For convenience in description, circularly polarized light of direction of rotation capable of being transmitted by cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is taken as right-handed circularly polarized light L&plus;, while circularly polarized light of direction such as is reflected without being transmitted is taken as left-handed circularly polarized light L&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> has an optic axis <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> parallel to the plane of the drawing and is constituted with optical anisotropy such that it converts circularly polarized light to linearly polarized light. This optic axis <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is arranged to be parallel to one side of the rectangular external shape of polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is natural light whose direction of oscillation (polarization direction) is random, and includes a clockwise polarized light component L&plus; and an anticlockwise polarized light component L&minus;. Circularly polarized components in these without directions are incident on to cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Of the circularly polarized light that is incident on cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; can be transmitted through this liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> converts incident right-handed circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>oscillating in the direction that makes an angle of 45&deg; with respect to one side of the outer rectangular shape of polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> before outputting it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus; is reflected by this liquid crystal layer and again returned to organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus; that is returned to organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is reflected by reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. When the circularly polarized light is reflected at the metal surface, the direction of rotation of left-handed circularly polarized component (L&minus;) is inverted, converting it to right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus;. Right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; is again input to polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Since the direction of rotation of the circularly polarized component is now inverted to constitute circularly polarized component L&plus;, this is transmitted through cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and is emitted to quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> At quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the right-handed circularly polarized light that is transmitted through cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is converted to linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that oscillates in a direction making an angle of 45&deg; with respect to one side of the external rectangular shape of polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and is therefore emitted by transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In short, even through the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a random polarization condition, it can be finally supplied to the transparent liquid crystal panel is linearly polarized light with the direction of polarization aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> If the direction of polarization of linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is supplied to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> coincides with the direction of polarization in which polarizing plate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can transmit, the quantity of light that can be employed for optical modulation in the transparent liquid crystal panel can be made large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the principles of a polarization conversion element constructed of a quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are disclosed in Reference: Proceedings of the 15th International Display Research Conference, 1995, p. 735-738, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 29, (No. 4), April 1990, p.

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Since, with embodiment 4 as described above, of the light which is emitted from the organic electroluminescent element, all of the light that would otherwise fail to pass through the polarizing plate can be absorbed i.e. more than half of the light can be supplied for optical modulation by the transparent liquid crystal panel, so, ideally, an image that is twice as bright as conventionally can be projected on to the screen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to form a plurality of microprisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> by mutual meshing together of two members with zigzag-shaped surface irregularities. Microprisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are formed such that their boundary lines form a roof shape of 45&deg; angle with respect to the plane of the drawing. The boundary faces of microprisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are formed by means of a dielectric multi-layer film structure or the like, so as to transmit light of specified polarization condition and to reflect light of polarization condition other than this. In this embodiment, for convenience in description, it will be assumed that they transmit linearly polarized light of one polarization direction (p polarization) and reflect linearly polarized light (s polarization) in the direction of polarization orthogonal to this. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> has the same construction as quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of embodiment 4 and has an optical axis <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> parallel to the plane of the Figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, in place of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, there could be substituted organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described in embodiment 1 or organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as described in embodiment 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In particular, the polarization separation characteristic of micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> constituting polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of this embodiment shows considerable dependence on the angle of incidence of the incident light. It is therefore desirable to employ organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of embodiment 3 having an optical resonance construction in order to raise the directionality of the light incident on to micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As described in embodiment 4, the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is natural light having a random direction of oscillation and including a right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; and an anticlockwise circular polarized component L&minus;. Of the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; is converted to p polarized light by quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and is input to micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Since the p polarized light is capable of being transmitted by micro prisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, it is supplied to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in this unaltered polarization condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In contrast, of the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus; is converted to a polarized light by quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and is input to micro polarization beam splitter array <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The s polarized light is reflected by microprisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The boundary faces of the microprisms <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are inclined at 45&deg; with respect to the direction of incidence of the light, so the initial reflection changes the direction of the s polarized light to a direction at right angles to the direction of incidence and the second reflection changes its direction to the opposite direction to the direction of incidence. This reflected s polarized light is again converted to left-handed circularly polarized light L&minus; by quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and is returned to organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In short, even though the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a random polarization condition, it is finally supplied to the transparent liquid crystal panel as linearly polarized light all having the same direction of polarization. </paragraph>

The composition of transparent substrate <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and the liquid crystal material of liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are the same as in embodiment 1, so further description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is constituted of a material such as carbon that shows optical absorption and can be formed by printing or pasting in substrate form. Thus, of the light that is emitted to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, only light that is directed on to apertures <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is emitted at the projection lens side, light that is directed on to optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> being cut off. It should be noted that optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is not essential if the light emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be completely concentrated on to apertures <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> When a fixed DC voltage (for example about 10 volts) is applied between transparent electrode layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, light is emitted from luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Then, as described with reference to embodiment 3, light of specified wavelength determined by the distance between dielectric mirror <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The wavelength band of the emission spectrum of this emitted light is narrow. Microlens elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are designed such that the focal point in aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is focused for light of this specified wavelength. In contrast, for light of other than the specified wavelength, the degree of refraction produced by the lens is different, so such light is brought to a focus either upstream or downstream in the optic axis direction with respect to aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, producing a large ring of light at aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Consequently, light of the specified wavelength passes through aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and is emitted at the projection lens side, but most of light of wavelengths other than this is ether absorbed or reflected by optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and so is not emitted to the projection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The greater the degree of parallelism of the light that is input to microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the smaller is the focal spot produced by microlens elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, so the amount of light that can pass through pixel apertures <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the parallelism of the light that is input to microlens array <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is lower i.e. it is more divergent, the light cannot be sufficiently focused by microlens elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and so the focal spot becomes larger than pixel aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, resulting in light being absorbed or reflected by optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The amount of light that can be transmitted through aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is thereby lowered, making the image that is projected on to the screen darker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Consequently, use of an organic electroluminescent element having an optical resonance construction in which the directionality of emitted light can be raised is particularly desirable in the present embodiment employing a microlens array element, in order to increase the amount of light that can pass through the pixels of the liquid crystal panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, if a microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> were not used, light absorbed or reflected by optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> would be unable to pass through the liquid crystal panel, so the image projected on to the screen would be dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this embodiment 6, since an organic electroluminescent element having a resonance construction of excellent directionality is employed for the emitted light, this can be focused on to the pixel apertures of the liquid crystal panel by the microlens array element, enabling the amount of light that can be transmitted through the pixel apertures to be increased; color display of high brightness and color purity can thus be achieved with the liquid-crystal projection device for color display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 7) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 7 of the present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device further employing a rear-side microlens array element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> (Construction) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> A liquid-crystal projection device according to the seventh embodiment has the same construction as embodiment 6 described above apart from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>includes an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and rear-side microlens array <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are the same as described in embodiment 6, so further description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Rear-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> arranged corresponding to the pixels of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, if transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is constituted of 640 (horizontal)&times;480 (vertical) pixels, rear-side microlens element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is likewise constituted of 640&times;480 microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. Rear-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is constructed by a method of manufacture such as plastic injection moulding or glass press forming, using a mould formed with lens surface shapes of microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> could be constructed by diffraction lenses. The lens surface shape of the individual microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is formed such as to provide a fixed focal length (for example 2.5 mm) for light of the specific wavelength emitted by organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This focal length is the front focal length of microlens element <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. The distance between transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and rear-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is adjusted such that this focal length is equal to the distance from pixel elements <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the principal point of microlens element <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. For example, if the focal length on the rear side of front microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the focal length on the front side of rear microlens element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are set to the same distance, the distance between front microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and pixel aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and the distance between rear microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and pixel aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> are arranged to be the same. A reflection-preventing film <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is formed on both the optical input face and optical output face of rear microlens element <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. Preferably reflection-preventing film <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is designed such as to provide a lowest reflectivity in respect of the wavelength of the light that is emitted by organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> As described above in embodiment 6, light that is input to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is brought to a focal point at pixel aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and then becomes divergent light <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. Microlens elements <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of rear-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are designed such that their front-side focal length is equal to the distance of aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. Divergent light <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is therefore again converted into parallel light by this microlens array element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Since, as described above, with this seventh embodiment, the rear-side microlens array element suppresses divergence of the light passing through liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a liquid-crystal projection device can be provided that is capable of projecting an even brighter image. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A liquid-crystal projection device according to embodiment 8 has the same construction as embodiment 1 described above apart from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>includes an organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has the same optical resonant construction as that described in embodiment 3; polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is the same as described in embodiment 4; and front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is of the same construction as described in embodiment 6; further description thereof is therefore omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes two transparent substrates <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and polarizing plates <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. On one of the liquid crystal layer sides of transparent substrate <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, there is provided an aperture <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> for each pixel and a screening pattern <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is provided around its periphery. Since transparent substrate <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, aperture <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> and optical screening pattern <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are respectively the same as transparent substrate <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, aperture <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and screening pattern <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of embodiment 6, description thereof is omitted. In order to facilitate understanding of the drawing, just as in the case of embodiment 1, the drive circuit provided on the transparent substrate and the display circuit etc. for supplying control signals to the transparent electrodes, wiring and drive circuit are not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> As liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, a known twisted nematic liquid crystal or the like is employed; this is arranged such that in the condition in which voltage is applied it does not rotate the plane of polarization of the incident light but in the condition when voltage is not applied it does rotate the plane of polarization of incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Polarizing plates <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have the same construction and are arranged such as to transmit only light of a specified polarization condition other incident light. However, the direction of polarization of light transmitted by polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is arranged to be offset by a certain angle with respect to the direction of polarization of transmission by polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This angle is set to be equal to the angle of rotation of the plane polarization that is produced when the plane of polarization of incoming light is rotated when no voltage is applied to liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Also, the direction of polarization of linearly polarized light emitted from polarizing conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is arranged to coincide with the direction of polarization capable of being transmitted by polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Furthermore, the distance between the principal potential of microlens element <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and aperture <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set to be equal to the rear-side focal length of microlens element <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> For convenience in description, it is assumed that circularly polarized light of the direction of rotation that is capable of being transmitted by cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is right-handed circularly polarized light L&plus;, while the circular polarization of direction of rotation that is reflected without being transmitted is left-handed circularly polarized light L&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The wavelength region of light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is restricted by the optical resonance structure (see embodiment 3). However, the direction of oscillation of the light is random and includes both a right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; and a left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus;. Circularly polarized components in both these directions are input to cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Since, of the circularly polarized components that are input to cholersteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; can be transmitted through this liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, it is input to quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> converts right-handed circularly polarized incoming light into linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>oscillating in a direction that makes and angle of 45&deg; with respect to one side of the external rectangular shape of polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus; is reflected by this liquid crystal layer and is returned once more to organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Left-handed circularly polarized component L&minus; that has returned to organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, where it is reflected. When the circularly polarized light is reflected, left-handed circularly polarized light component L&minus; has its direction of rotation reversed and becomes right-handed circularly polarized light component L&plus;. Right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus; is again input to polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This time, since the circularly polarized component has been reversed in direction of rotation, becoming right-handed circularly polarized component L&plus;, it is able to pass through cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and is emitted to quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Quarter-wavelength film <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> converts the right-handed circularly polarized light that has passed through cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>making an angle of 45&deg; with respect to one side of the rectangular external shape of the polarization conversion element and oscillating in the same direction as the direction of oscillation of linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; this linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is then output to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In short, whatever the polarization condition of the light that is emitted from organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the light that is supplied to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is aligned in direction of oscillation and close to parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Since, in this embodiment, an organic electroluminescent element having a resonator structure is employed the light source, the wavelength band of the emission spectrum of the emitted light is narrowly defined. The polarization selective reflection function of the polarization conversion element and the optical characteristics of the microlens array element can therefore be optimized for this specific wavelength region only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The wavelength dependence of the polarization selective reflection function of the polarization conversion element is determined, conversion element is determined, in the case of the polarization conversion element in embodiment 4, by the helical period of cholesteric liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and, in the case of the polarization conversion element in embodiment 5, is determined by the layer-stacking period of the dielectric multi-layer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In attempting to confer a polarization selective reflection function in a wavelength region including red, green and blue, the need therefore arises to superimpose in multiple stages helical periodical structures or stacked-layer periodical structures corresponding to each primary color in each of the polarization conversion elements. However, the construction of the polarization conversion element is straightforward in that, when constructing polarization conversion elements functioning only in respective specified wavelength regions such as red, green or blue, it suffices to provide a helical periodical structure or stacked-layer periodical structure corresponding just to that wavelength region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Microlens elements <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> constituting front-side microlens array element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> focus light from polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on to apertures <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> of transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The direction of polarization of linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>supplied to transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> coincides with the direction of polarization that is capable of passing through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This linearly polarized light <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>therefore passes through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is focused on to pixel apertures <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> When no electric field is applied to liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> rotates the plane of polarization of incident light by a fixed angle. And when an electric field is applied to liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the direction of the electrical field and no polarization plane rotation is applied to incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Consequently, in the case of pixels to which voltage is not applied, the plane of the incident light is rotated, allowing the light to pass through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and to be output at the projection lens side. In contrast, in the case of pixels to which voltage is applied, no rotation is applied to the plane of polarization of the incoming light which therefore cannot pass through polarizing plate <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and is absorbed or reflected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this embodiment 8, thanks to the organic electroluminescent element, intense light of a specified wavelength and excellent directionality is extracted, the direction of polarization is aligned by means of the polarization conversion element, and the amount of light that can pass through the pixel apertures is increased by the microlens array element; a liquid-crystal projection device in which a bright projected image is obtained can therefore be provided. </paragraph>

In other words, organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and transparent liquid crystal panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in this Figure are shown by way of example and the optical elements of the foregoing embodiments could be applied in place of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Projection lens <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is constructed such that an image that is output from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is focused on screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Only one projection lens is shown in the Figure, but this could of course be constituted by an assembly of a plurality of lenses. Specifically, this is constituted such that an image emitted from liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is brought to a focus on screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> after magnification etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> However, if a liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>according to embodiment 6 or a liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>according to embodiment 8 is employed, the output light is divergent light. Projection lens <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is therefore adjusted such that this divergent light is brought to a focus on screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Also, in this embodiment, the image is observed from the rear side of the screen, so the image that is projected on to screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> must be inverted compared with embodiment 1. Projection lens <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is therefore constructed so as to invert the projection image before displaying it. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> For example, if the diagonal size of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is assumed to be 33 mm (1.3 inches) and the magnification factor of projection lens <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is assumed to be about 12 times, the image displayed on screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will be of diagonal size 400 mm (15.6 inches). With this embodiment 9 as described above, an image is projected on to a transparent screen using a liquid crystal display element according to the present invention, so a projected image can be provided that is brighter than with a device using a conventional electroluminescent element. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> liquid-crystal projection device according to this embodiment includes a red liquid crystal display element IR, a green liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G, a blue liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, a red wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>R, a green wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>G, a blue wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B, a dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Hereinbelow, of the three primary colors employed in this embodiment, optical elements relating to red color are denoted by affixing the suffix R, optical elements relating to green color by the suffix G, and optical element relating to blue color by the suffix B, respectively. As liquid crystal display elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, there are applied liquid crystal display elements respectively equipped with an organic electroluminescent element that emits light of red colour, an organic electroluminescent element that emits light of green color or an organic electroluminescent element that emits light of blue color, as light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> However, the degree of refraction by projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> must be varied, since the emitted light shows some degree of divergence when if and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>including a front-side microlens array element (reference numeral <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) are applied to a liquid crystal display element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Also, a liquid crystal display element is employed in which the wavelength of the emitted light is adjusted when <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>including organic electroluminescent elements (reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) having an optical resonance structure are applied in the liquid crystal display element. Specifically, in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>R, the wavelength region of the emitted light of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set to red. As in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G, the wavelength region of the emitted light of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set to green. And in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, the wavelength region of the emitted light of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set to blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the distance between dielectric mirror layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and reflecting electrode layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is adjusted after selecting the material of luminescent layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of organic electroluminescent element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Although, if polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of embodiment 4 or polarization conversion element <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of embodiment 5 is employed, a polarization conversion element could be employed having a polarization selective reflection function over the entire visible light region, use of a polarization conversion element having a polarization selective reflection function for a specific wavelength region only enables the efficiency of utilization of light to be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Also, if a microlens array element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) is employed, the lens is designed such as to reduce aberration when light of that color is input. Furthermore, the reflection preventing film (<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>) of the microlens element is adjusted such that its reflectivity is lowest when light of that color is input. For example, adjustment is effected so as to satisfy the aforementioned condition in respect of light of wavelength 610 nm in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>R, in respect of light of wavelength 535 nm in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G, and with respect to light of wavelength 470 nm in the case of liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Wavelength filters <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are constructed using a glass plate or plastics plate. Red wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>R is constructed so as to be capable of transmitting light of red wavelength. Green wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>G is constructed so as to be capable of transmitting light of green wavelength. Blue wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B is constructed so as to be capable of transmitting light of blue wavelength. Wavelength filters <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>G and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B can be removed from the structural elements. Dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is constructed to be capable of combining the images from liquid crystal display elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. In more detail, dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is constituted by assembling a plurality of prisms, formed with dielectric multi-layer filters that reflect light of a specific wavelength at their boundary faces. For example, filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>R is constituted to reflect light of red wavelength and to transmit light of other wavelengths. Filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B is constituted to reflect light of blue wavelength and to transmit light of other wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is adjusted to be capable of projecting a combined image from dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on to screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. While only one lens is shown in the Figure, it could be constructed of a plurality of lenses. Frame <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is constructed with a volume capable of containing all the optical elements of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is the same as that described with reference to embodiment 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The images that are supplied from liquid crystal display elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>G and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B through wavelength filters <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>R, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>G and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B to dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are images of light of the respective primary colors. The red light reflected by film <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>R of dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The blue light is reflected by filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>R of dichoroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The green light is reflected by neither filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>R nor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B and passes through both filters. As a result, an image obtained by combination of the light of these three colors is emitted on the projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> side of dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This image is magnified and projected on to screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The image projected on to screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be observed by an observer from the rear side. For example, if the transparent liquid crystal panel is constituted with a diagonal size of about 63.5 mm (2.5 inches), rear projection screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed with a diagonal size of about 1 m (about 40 inches). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this embodiment 10, liquid crystal display elements according to the present invention are provided for each primary color and these are combined to produce a color image, so, compared with the case where illumination is effected with a single organic electroluminescent element emitting white light, a brighter color image can be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 11) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> liquid-crystal projection device according to this embodiment has practically the same construction as the liquid-crystal projection device of embodiment 10. However, the liquid-crystal projection device of this embodiment is further provided with a reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be capable of reflecting light from projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a direction at right angles with respect to the optic axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Screen <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be capable of projecting the image reflected by reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> such that it can be observed from the back face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Frame <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be capable of arranging the various optical elements such that an image of suitable size can be formed on screen <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> This is the same as in the case of embodiment 10 as far as the emission from projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a combined image obtained by combining images of the respective primary colors. This combined image is reflected by reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and is projected on to screen <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In order to project an image of the same magnification as in embodiment 10, the distance on the optic axis from projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to screen <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be made equal to the distance from projection lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to screen <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in embodiment 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> With this embodiment 11, liquid crystal display elements according to the present invention are provided for each primary color and these are combined to generate a color image, so a bright color image can be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Also, there is the advantage that, if a convex-surfaced mirror is provided as the reflecting mirror, the image is further magnified by this reflection, so large image magnification can be obtained even if the distance on the optic axis is short. Also, since the image produced by reflection by the reflecting mirror can be inverted, if the image that is emitted from the projection lens was inverted, this further inversion of the image enables it to be corrected to a non-inverted image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 12) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 12 of the present invention provides a liquid-crystal projection device for color display different from that of embodiment 10. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the construction of a liquid-crystal projection device according to this embodiment is practically the same as that of a liquid-crystal projection device according to embodiment 10. However, a liquid-crystal projection device according to this embodiment differs from embodiment 10 in that, instead of a screen being incorporated within the frame as in embodiment 10, an external screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is arranged to be capable of being projected on to. Projection lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is arranged to be capable of projecting a combined image on to external screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In this Figure, it is constituted by a single projection lens, but an assembly of a plurality of lenses could be used. In particular: the distance with respect to the screen for projection on to an external screen is not fixed. It is therefore constructed so as to focus at whatever distance screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Since frame <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> does not contain a screen within the frame, it is constructed so as to be able to contain liquid crystal display element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, wavelength filter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, dichroic prism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and projection lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> (Action) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, light that is emitted from projection lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is projected on to a screen arranged outside. The magnification factor of the image varies depending on the construction of the lens of projection lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the distance between projection lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and screen <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As described above, with this embodiment 12, a liquid-crystal projection device can be provided which does not incorporate a screen. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that, although, in the present embodiments, a flat plate-shaped transparent liquid crystal panel was employed, so the organic electroluminescent elements were also made in the form of a flat plate so as to illuminate this liquid crystal panel evenly, if the display surface of the liquid-crystal-panel were for example curved, the organic electroluminescent elements could also be deformed so as to match the surface shape of the liquid crystal panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Also, so long as the front-side microlens array element, rear side microlens array element, polarization conversion element and transparent liquid crystal panel can provide the functions set out in the embodiments, other constructions of these could be employed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLIBILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Since, with the present invention, a flat plate-shaped organic electroluminescent element is employed in which a larger amount of light can be obtained with lower drive voltage than with the conventional light source using inorganic material, a liquid-crystal projection device of small size can be provided in which a brighter image than conventionally can be projected. Also, according to the present invention, if an organic electroluminescent element is employed having a resonator structure that emits light with better directionality of the emitted light than conventionally to the liquid crystal panel, diminution of the quantity of light due to divergence of the light can be prevented, making it possible to provide a liquid-crystal projection device of small size and that can be driven with low voltage and in which a bright image can be projected. Since, according to the present invention, a polarization conversion element is employed that can convert the polarization condition of emitted light, a liquid-crystal projection device in which a bright image can be projected can be provided, by increasing the amount of light that can pass through the polarizing plate of the liquid crystal panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since, in projection of a color image, a polarization conversion element is employed that functions in a specified wavelength band, the amount of light that can pass through the polarizing plate of the liquid crystal panel is increased, enabling a liquid-crystal projection device of small size to be provided in which a bright image can be projected. Use of a microlens array element in which light is focused on to the pixel apertures of the liquid crystal panel according to the present invention increases the amount of light that can pass through the pixel apertures, thereby enabling a liquid-crystal projection device of small size to be provided in which a bright image can be projected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In the projection of a color image according to the present invention, use of a small luminescent element in which, due to optical resonance, only light of specific wavelength is emitted increases the amount of light of specific wavelength thereby enabling a liquid-crystal projection device of small size to be provided whereby a bright image can be projected. </paragraph>
