<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a security closure for bottles of liquor and the like, that comprises a stopper cap having an end wall and a skirt with a security seal, and a sleeve that screws into the said stopper cap and fits onto a neck of a bottle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Security closures for bottles of liquor and the like of this kind are known and are in wide use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These closures are produced with all their components assembled in one piece which is then fitted directly to the neck of a bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More specifically, after inserting an inner cap inside the stopper cap in such a way that it is held against the end wall of the stopper cap, the sleeve is screwed into the inner wall of the skirt of the stopper cap by engagement between a thread on this inner wall and a corresponding thread on the outer wall of the said sleeve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus assembled, the cap is now fitted to the neck of a bottle in such a way that a snap engagement occurs between the above mentioned sleeve and the neck of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More precisely, the snap engagement is caused by an edge of the sleeve being pushed over a ramp formed on the neck of the bottle and into a groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By this means the sleeve is fixed non-removably to the neck of the bottle, while the threaded engagement between this sleeve and the stopper cap allows the stopper cap to be unscrewed and rescrewed onto the neck of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, there is one major disadvantage with this product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The force necessary to pass over the above mentioned ramp and bring about the snap engagement during the application of the closure to a bottle is about 70 kg. This force is taken directly by the sleeve which, being screwed to the skirt of the stopper cap, passes this force on through the threaded engagement between the respective threads of the sleeve and skirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This threaded engagement does not however provide satisfactory resistance to this force and the result is that the threads are either stripped or at least forced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> There is therefore a felt need to provide a security closure for bottles of liquors and the like that can be applied easily and securely to a bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The problem addressed by the present invention is therefore that of devising a security closure for bottles of liquors and the like, whose structural and functional characteristics will be such as to satisfy the above mentioned requirements and at the same time overcome the problems presented by security closures of the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to the accompanying figures, the number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a general reference for a security closure for a bottle of liquor or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The closure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an outer cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with an end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a security seal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an inner cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and valve parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a disc having a substantially flat outer surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that possesses means for fixing it to the inner cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To be specific, these means consist of a ring <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> projecting from the inner surface <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> towards the interior of the cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the said ring having an internal profile <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of grooves and axial teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> consists of a hollow cylinder extending from the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> parallel with an axis X-X perpendicular to the plane of the end wall for a defined length towards a free end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In addition the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has stop means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprising a projection projecting towards the axis X-X. In particular, the projection is a shoulder designed to abut against the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> when the sleeve is engaged coaxially inside the skirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> These stop means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are preferably a step profile on the inner surface of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> producing a rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> substantially perpendicular to the inner surface of the skirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In particular, said rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constitutes an abutting surface against which the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can stop, as will be described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> From the remote end <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with respect to the inner surface of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an upward portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> runs parallel to the axis X-X and joins the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via a connecting edge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The said connecting edge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also the radial abutment of the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, furthermore, as shown in the drawings of the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes an inward projection <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and another step profile <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, from the near end <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of the rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (with respect to the inner surface of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> there extends, however, a lower portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, likewise parallel to the axis X-X but in the opposite direction to the upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> From the above description, and with particular reference to the drawings, it will therefore be seen that the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of an upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of smaller diameter than a lower portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The inner surface of said lower portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is threaded <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Also, the security seal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is attached to the free end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by means of bridges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that break when the bottle is first opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also extending from the near end <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of the rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, towards the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and parallel with the upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, are elastic means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the example shown, said elastic means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are an annular band concentric with the upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> but separated from it by a annular gap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This annular gap has the function of allowing the annular band <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to flex radially towards the axis X-X, thus initially facilitating the fitting of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> over the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and then keeping said cover in place by means of the interference between the outer surface of the annular band <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> More precisely, the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a generally flat disc-shaped end wall <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a hollow cylindrical skirt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that extends parallel with the axis X-X, coinciding with that of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in such a way as to end approximately flush with the free end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The skirt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a diameter such that it fits exactly around the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The generally cylindrical sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has an axis coinciding with the axis X-X of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and has an upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a lower edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms an abutment which will provide the above mentioned bearing surface for the rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In particular, the upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms a flanged upper surface that extends inwards approximately at right angles to the axis X-X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously, moreover, this upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is designed to snap-engage removably into a groove <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the outer surface of the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In detail, when the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is fitted to the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a bottle as described later, its upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is forced over a ramp <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> formed on the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> near its upper edge and into the groove <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Said sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has an external thread <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for screwing into the corresponding thread <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> present on the inner surface of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> On the inside, meanwhile, the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has teeth <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> running in an axial direction for abutting against corresponding projections <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided on the neck of the bottle in order to prevent the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from being rotated relative to the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Close to the lower edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> flares outwards slightly and its outer surface exhibits a projection <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is used as a stop to prevent axial movement of the seal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the bottle is opened for the first time, before the bridges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> break. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The inner cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is of conventional type and will not be described here in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the above mentioned inner cap is fitted to the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of a grooved profile <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as it provides a form fit with the corresponding grooved profile <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The security closure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also includes valve parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, of conventional type, contained releasably in the interior of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> These valve parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are there to prevent filling of a bottle, while allowing a liquid contained in the bottle to be poured out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The security closure according to the present invention is assembled to form a one-piece item that can be handled on its own in the manner described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> First of all the inner cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is inserted into the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and engaged securely with the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as described earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, the valve means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are inserted into the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and held there releasably by their engagement with the above mentioned projection <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and step profile <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is now screwed into the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> until the upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of this sleeve abuts against the rise <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the step profile on the inside of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The security closure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, having thus been assembled, is now ready to be fitted to the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The above mentioned closure is press-fitted onto the said neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as far as the point at which the upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> snaps into engagement in the groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of this neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To bring about the snap engagement, the upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> must deform elastically to pass over the ramp <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> formed near the upper edge of the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Once the upper edge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has engaged in the groove <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> cannot be removed from around the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the valve parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> lock onto the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a bottle and remain fixed to it when the said bottle is opened for the first time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The advantage of using the security closure according to the invention is that the pressure required to snap the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into position on the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bottle can be applied without running the significant risk of stripping or at least forcing the thread formerly used to screw the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> This is explained by the fact that the stop means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> perform a special function of providing resistance to the above mentioned pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Another advantageous aspect of the closure according to the invention is that of giving excellent centring of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> when the stopper cap needs to be screwed back onto the bottle, as the narrower upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> sits more or less exactly on the end of the bottle neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of using the security closure according to the invention is that a decorative outer cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be non-removably mounted on the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> because the elastic means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are able to flex slightly towards the axis X-X and allow the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be fitted over the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The subsequent elastic return of these elastic means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the rest position allows the said parts to grip the inner wall of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by slight interference. As a result, the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be more or less firmly held together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The security closure of the invention is capable of many variants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In particular, the stop means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may take the form of a simple projection on the inner surface of the skirt of the stopper cap, in which case the upper portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will coincide with the annular band <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the end wall <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be joined directly to the said upper portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The valve parts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may also be absent, and the inner cap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be modified to make a seal on the inner wall of the neck <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The respective threads of the sleeve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be single-start or multistart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The skirt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be extended so as to project slightly from the free end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the skirt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the stopper cap <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The outer cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be decorated as desired with colour, designs and/or inscriptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The shapes and/or dimensions of the components of the closure described above may be modified for particular requirements or preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Likewise the materials employed may differ to suit particular conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the above account, the security closure according to the invention satisfies the needs referred to in the introductory part of this description and at the same time overcomes the difficulties presented by the security closures of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In essence, then, the present invention is a security closure for liquors and the like that can be fitted to bottles easily and without difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Clearly, in order to satisfy particular and specific requirements, the person skilled in the art could make numerous modifications and alterations to the security closure for liquors and the like described above, all such modifications and alterations remaining within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
