<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to a method and apparatus for treating congestive heart disease and related valvular dysfunction. More particularly, the present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for delivery of a cardiac constraint jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Congestive heart disease is a progressive and debilitating illness. The disease is characterized by a progressive enlargement of the heart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As the heart enlarges, the heart is performing an increasing amount of work in order to pump blood each heart beat. In time, the heart becomes so enlarged the heart cannot adequately supply blood. An afflicted patient is fatigued, unable to perform even simple exerting tasks and experiences pain and discomfort. Further, as the heart enlarges, the internal heart valves cannot adequately close. This impairs the function of the valves and further reduces the heart&apos;s ability to supply blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Causes of congestive heart disease are not fully known. In certain instances, congestive heart disease may result from viral infections. In such cases, the heart may enlarge to such an extent that the adverse consequences of heart enlargement continue after the viral infection has passed and the disease continues its progressively debilitating course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Patients suffering from congestive heart disease are commonly grouped into four classes (i.e., Classes I, II, III and IV). In the early stages (e.g., Classes I and II), drug therapy is the most commonly prescribed treatment. Drug therapy treats the symptoms of the disease and may slow the progression of the disease. Importantly, there is no cure for congestive heart disease. Even with drug therapy, the disease will progress. Further, the drugs may have adverse side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Presently, the only permanent treatment for congestive heart disease is heart transplant. To qualify, a patient must be in the later stage of the disease (e.g., Classes III and IV with Class IV patients given priority for transplant). Such patients are extremely sick individuals. Class III patients have marked physical activity limitations and Class IV patients are symptomatic even at rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Due to the absence of effective intermediate treatment between drug therapy and heart transplant, Class III and IV patients will have suffered terribly before qualifying for heart transplant. Further, after such suffering, the available treatment is unsatisfactory. Heart transplant procedures are very risky, extremely invasive and expensive and only shortly extend a patient&apos;s life. For example, prior to transplant, a Class IV patient may have a life expectancy of 6 months to one-year. Heart transplant may improve the expectancy to about five years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, not enough hearts are available for transplant to meet the needs of congestive heart disease patients. In the United States, in excess of 35,000 transplant candidates compete for only about 2,000 transplants per year. A transplant waiting list is about 8-12 months long on average and frequently a patient may have to wait about 1-2 years for a donor heart. While the availability of donor hearts has historically increased, the rate of increase is slowing dramatically. Even if the risks and expense of heart transplant could be tolerated, this treatment option is becoming increasingly unavailable. Further, many patients do not qualify for heart transplant due to failure to meet any one of a number of qualifying criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Congestive heart failure has an enormous societal impact. In the United States alone, about five million people suffer from the disease (Classes I through IV combined). Alarmingly, congestive heart failure is one of the most rapidly accelerating diseases (about 400,000 new patients in the United States each year). Economic costs of the disease have been estimated at $38 billion annually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Not surprising, substantial effort has been made to find alternative treatments for congestive heart disease. Recently, a new surgical procedure has been developed. Referred to as the Batista procedure, the surgical technique includes dissecting and removing portions of the heart in order to reduce heart volume. This is a radical new and experimental procedure subject to substantial controversy. Furthermore, the procedure is highly invasive, risky and expensive and commonly includes other expensive procedures (such as a concurrent heart valve replacement). Also, the treatment is limited to Class IV patients and, accordingly, provides no hope to patients facing ineffective drug treatment prior to Class IV. Finally, if the procedure fails, emergency heart transplant is the only available option. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Clearly, there is a need for alternative treatments applicable to both early and later stages of the disease to either stop the progressive nature of the disease or more drastically slow the progressive nature of congestive heart disease. Unfortunately, currently developed options are experimental, costly and problematic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Cardiomyoplasty is a recently developed treatment for earlier stage congestive heart disease (e.g., as early as Class III dilated cardiomyopathy). In this procedure, the latissimus dorsi muscle (taken from the patient&apos;s shoulder) is wrapped around the heart and chronically paced synchronously with ventricular systole. Pacing of the muscle results in muscle contraction to assist the contraction of the heart during systole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Even though cardiomyoplasty has demonstrated symptomatic improvement, studies suggest the procedure only minimally improves cardiac performance. The procedure is highly invasive requiring harvesting a patient&apos;s muscle and an open chest approach (i.e., sternotomy) to access the heart. Furthermore, the procedure is expensive&mdash;especially those using a paced muscle. Such procedures require costly pacemakers. The cardiomyoplasty procedure is complicated. For example, it is difficult to adequately wrap the muscle around the heart with a satisfactory fit. Also, if adequate blood flow is not maintained to the wrapped muscle, the muscle may necrose. The muscle may stretch after wrapping reducing its constraining benefits and is generally not susceptible to post-operative adjustment. Finally, the muscle may fibrose and adhere to the heart causing undesirable constraint on the contraction of the heart during systole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> While cardiomyoplasty has resulted in symptomatic improvement, the nature of the improvement is not understood. For example, one study has suggested the benefits of cardiomyoplasty are derived less from active systolic assist than from remodeling, perhaps because of an external elastic constraint. The study suggests an elastic constraint (i.e., a non-stimulated muscle wrap or an artificial elastic sock placed around the heart) could provide similar benefits. Kass et al., <highlight><italic>Reverse Remodeling From Cardiomyoplasty In Human Heart Failure: External Constraint Versus Active Assist, </italic></highlight>91 <highlight><italic>Circulation </italic></highlight>2314-2318(1995). Similarly, cardiac binding is described in Oh et al., <highlight><italic>The Effects of Prosthetic Cardiac Binding and Adynamic Cardiomyoplasty in a Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy, </italic></highlight>116 <highlight><italic>J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. </italic></highlight>148-153 (1998), Vaynblat et al., <highlight><italic>Cardiac Binding in Experimental Heart Failure, </italic></highlight>64 <highlight><italic>Ann. Thorac. Surg. </italic></highlight>81- 85(1997) and Capouya et al., <highlight><italic>Girdling Effect of Nonstimulated Cardiomyoplasty on Left Ventricular Function, </italic></highlight>56 <highlight><italic>Ann. Thorac. Surg. </italic></highlight>867-871 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition to cardiomyoplasty, mechanical assist devices have been developed as intermediate procedures for treating congestive heart disease. Such devices include left ventricular assist devices (&ldquo;LVAD&rdquo;) and total artificial hearts (&ldquo;TAH&rdquo;). An LVAD includes a mechanical pump for urging blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. Such surgeries are expensive. The devices are at risk of mechanical failure and frequently require external power supplies. TAH devices are used as temporary measures while a patient awaits a donor heart for transplant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,343 to Alferness dated Dec. 30, 1997 teaches a jacket to constrain cardiac expansion during diastole. Also, PCT International Publication No. WO 98/29401 published Jul. 9, 1998 teaches a cardiac constraint in the form of surfaces on opposite sides of the heart with the surfaces joined together by a cable through the heart or by an external constraint. U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,528 dated Sep. 1, 1998 teaches a passive girdle to surround a heart. German utility model DE 295 17 393 describes a non-expansible heart pouch. PCT International Publication No. WO 98/58598 published Dec. 30, 1998 describes a cardiac pouch with an elastic limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A cardiac constraint device can be placed on an enlarged heart and fitted snug during diastole. For example, a knit jacket device can be loosely slipped on the heart. After such placement, the material of the jacket can be gathered to adjust the device to a desired tension. The gathered material can be sutured or otherwise fixed to maintain the tensioning. The heart may be pre-shrunk prior to placement of the device or the device may be fitted on the heart without pre-shrinking the heart. The device is adjusted to a snug fit on the heart during diastole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When placing a cardiac constraint jacket around a heart, surgical access is made to the heart. Such access may include a full sternotomy where the sternum is split lengthwise and separated to expose the heart. Recognizing such a procedure is highly traumatic, cardiac surgery continues to explore new surgical techniques ad tools to access the heart through less invasive procedures. Also, when placing the cardiac constraint jacket on the heart, it may be necessary to manipulate the heart. Excessive manipulation is undesirable since the heart may respond by fibrillating requiring the surgeon to exercise defibrillating procedures or therapies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to improved methods and apparatus to deliver the cardiac constraint device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method and apparatus are disclosed for treating congestive heart disease and related cardiac complications such as valvular disorders. A cardiac constraint jacket is formed of flexible material defining a volume between an open upper end and a lower end. The jacket is dimensioned for an apex of a patient&apos;s heart to be inserted into the volume through the open upper end and for the jacket to be slipped over the heart. A delivery device is used in placing the jacket on the heart. In preferred embodiments, the delivery device includes a plurality of attachment locations. Each of the attachment locations is releasably secured at positions surrounding a periphery of the open upper end of the jacket. The delivery device also includes a control arrangement selectively movable between an open position and a closed position. The control arrangement is operatively connected to some or all of the attachment locations. The control arrangement can be selectively moved to a closed or open position. When in the closed position, the attachment locations are in a compact array position, which urges the open upper end of the jacket into a collapsed configuration. When the control arrangement is in an open position, the attachment locations are in an open array which urges the open upper end of the jacket into an open configuration sufficient for the heart to be inserted into the jacket volume through the open upper end for the jacket to be slipped over the heart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the open end of the jacket may be releasably secured to the attachment locations with the control arrangement moved to the closed position. In the closed position, the delivery device and jacket can be advanced toward the apex of the heart through a restricted space. The control arrangement can then be moved to an open position when the open end of the jacket has passed through the restricted space and is in proximity to the apex for placement of the jacket on the heart. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the heart H&prime; is shown during systole (i.e., high left ventricular pressure). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the heart H&prime; is shown during diastole (i.e., low left ventricular pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The heart H&prime; is a muscle having an outer wall or myocardium MYO&prime; and an internal wall or septum S&prime;. The myocardium MYO&prime; and septum S&prime; define four internal heart chambers including a right atrium RA&prime;, a left atrium LA&prime;, a right ventricle RV&prime; and a left ventricle LV&prime;. The heart H&prime; has a length measured along a longitudinal axis BB&prime;-AA&prime; from an Upper end or base B&prime; to a lower end or apex A&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The right and left atria RA&prime;, LA&prime; reside in an upper portion UP&prime; of the heart H&prime; adjacent the base B&prime;. The right and left ventricles RV&prime;, LV&prime; reside in a lower portion LP&prime; of the heart H&prime; adjacent the apex A&prime;. The ventricles RV&prime;, LV&prime; terminate at ventricular lower extremities LE&prime; adjacent the apex A&prime; and spaced therefrom by the thickness of the myocardium MYO&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Due to the compound curves of the upper and lower portions UP&prime;, LP&prime;, the upper and lower portions UP&prime;, LP&prime; meet at a circumferential groove commonly referred to as the A-V (atrio-ventricular) groove AVG&prime;. Extending away from the upper portion UP&prime; are a plurality of major blood vessels communicating with the chambers RA&prime;, RV&prime;, LA&prime;, LV&prime;. For ease of illustration, only the superior vena cava SVC&prime;, inferior vena cava IVC&prime;and a left pulmonary vein LPV&prime; are shown as being representative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The heart H&prime; contains valves to regulate blood flow between the chambers RA&prime;, RV&prime;, LA&prime;, LV&prime; and between the chambers and the major vessels (e.g., the superior vena cava SVC&prime;, inferior vena cava IVC&prime; and a left pulmonary vein LPV&prime;). For ease of illustration, not all of such valves are shown. Instead, only the tricuspid valve TV&prime; between the right atrium RA&prime; and right ventricle RV&prime; and the mitral valve MV&prime; between the left atrium LA&prime; and left ventricle LV&prime; are shown as being representative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The valves are secured, in part, to the myocardium MYO&prime; in a region of the lower portion LP&prime; adjacent the A-V groove AVG&prime; and referred to as the valvular annulus VA&prime;. The valves TV&prime; and MV&prime; open and close through the beating cycle of the heart H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A show a normal, healthy heart H&prime; during systole and diastole, respectively. During systole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the myocardium MYO&prime; is contracting and the heart assumes a shape including a generally conical lower portion LP&prime;. During diastole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), the heart H&prime; is expanding and the conical shape of the lower portion LP&prime; bulges radially outwardly (relative to axis AA&prime;-BB&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The motion of the heart H&prime; and the variation in the shape of the heart H&prime; during contraction and expansion is complex. The amount of motion varies considerably throughout the heart H&prime;. The motion includes a component which is parallel to the axis AA&prime;- BB&prime; (conveniently referred to as longitudinal expansion or contraction). The motion also includes a component perpendicular to the axis AA&prime;-BB&prime; (conveniently referred to as circumferential expansion or contraction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Having described a healthy heart H&prime; during systole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and diastole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), comparison can now be made with a heart deformed by congestive heart disease. Such a heart H is shown in systole in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in diastole in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. All elements of diseased heart H are labeled identically with similar elements of healthy heart H&prime; except only for the omission of the apostrophe in order to distinguish diseased heart H from healthy heart H&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> (showing hearts H&prime; and H during systole), the lower portion LP of the diseased heart H has lost the tapered conical shape of the lower portion LP&prime; of the healthy heart H&prime;. Instead, the lower portion LP of the diseased heart H dilates outwardly between the apex A and the A-V groove AVG. So deformed, the diseased heart H during systole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) resembles the healthy heart H&prime; during diastole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). During diastole (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), the deformation is even more extreme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As a diseased heart H enlarges from the representation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference>A, the heart H becomes a progressively inefficient pump. Therefore, the heart H requires more energy to pump the same amount of blood. Continued progression of the disease results in the heart H being unable to supply adequate blood to the patient&apos;s body and the patient becomes symptomatic of cardiac insufficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For ease of illustration, the progression of congestive heart disease has been illustrated and described with reference to a progressive dilation of the lower portion LP of the heart H. While such enlargement of the lower portion LP is most common and troublesome, enlargement of the upper portion UP may also occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In addition to cardiac insufficiency, the enlargement of the heart H can lead to valvular disorders. As the circumference of the valvular annulus VA increases, the leaflets of the valves TV and MV may spread apart. After a certain amount of enlargement, the spreading may be so severe the leaflets cannot completely close. Incomplete closure results in valvular regurgitation contributing to an additional degradation in cardiac performance. While circumferential enlargement of the valvular annulus VA may contribute to valvular dysfunction as described, the separation of the valve leaflets is most commonly attributed to deformation of the geometry of the heart H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> B. Cardiac Constraint Therapy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Having described the characteristics and problems of congestive heart disease, a treatment method and apparatus are described in commonly assigned and copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/114,757 filed Jul. 13, 1998. In general, a jacket is configured to surround the myocardium MYO. While the method of the present invention will be described with reference to a jacket as described in commonly assigned and copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/114,757 filed Jul. 13, 1998, it will be appreciated the present invention is applicable to any cardiac constraint device including those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,528 and PCT International Publication No. WO 98/29401. The entire disclosure of each of these documents is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 3A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, the cardiac constraint device is shown as a jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; of flexible, biologically compatible material. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; is an enclosed knit material having upper and lower ends <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; defines an internal volume <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; which is completely enclosed but for the open ends <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is open. In both embodiments, upper ends <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; are open. Throughout this description, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be discussed. Elements in common between the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are numbered identically with the addition of an apostrophe to distinguish the second embodiment and such elements need not be separately discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dimensioned with respect to a heart H to be treated. Specifically, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sized for the heart H to be constrained within the volume <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be slipped around the heart H. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a length L between the upper and lower ends <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> sufficient for the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to constrain the lower portion LP. The upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably extends at least to A-V groove AVG and further extends to the lower portion LP to constrain at least the lower ventricular extremities LE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the parietal pericardium is opened, the lower portion LP is free of obstructions for applying the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> over the apex A. If, however, the parietal pericardium is intact, the diaphragmatic attachment to the parietal pericardium inhibits application of the jacket over the apex A of the heart. In this situation, the jacket can be opened along a line extending from the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; to the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; of jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;. The jacket can then be applied around the pericardial surface of the heart and the opposing edges of the opened line secured together after placed on the heart. Systems for securing the opposing edges are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,343, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; can then be secured to the diaphragm or associated tissues using, for example, sutures, staples, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A, the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is closed and the length L is sized for the apex A of the heart H to be received within the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed at the A-V groove AVG. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference>A, the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is open and the length L&prime; is sized for the apex A of the heart H to protrude beyond the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; when the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; is placed at the A-V groove AVG. The length L&prime; is sized so that the lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; extends beyond the lower ventricular extremities LE such that in both of jackets <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, the myocardium MYO surrounding the ventricles RV, LV is in direct opposition to material of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; during diastole. Such placement is desirable for the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; to present a constraint against dilation of the ventricular portions of the heart H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> After the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned on the heart H as described above, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to the heart. Preferably, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to the heart H using sutures (or other fastening means such as staples). The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sutured to the heart H at suture locations S circumferentially spaced along the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. While a surgeon may elect to add additional suture locations to prevent shifting of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after placement, the number of such locations S is preferably limited so that the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not restrict contraction of the heart H during systole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constrains further undesirable circumferential enlargement of the heart while not impeding other motion of the heart H. With the benefits of the present teachings, numerous modifications are possible. For example, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> need not be directly applied to the epicardium (i.e., outer surface of the myocardium) but could be placed over the parietal pericardium. Further, an anti-fibrosis lining (such as a PTFE coating on the fibers of the knit) could be placed between the heart H and the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fibers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be coated with PTFE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used in early stages of congestive heart disease. For patients facing heart enlargement due to viral infection, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> permits constraint of the heart H for a sufficient time to permit the viral infection to pass. In addition to preventing further heart enlargement, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> treats valvular disorders by constraining circumferential enlargement of the valvular annulus and deformation of the ventricular walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> C. Tensioning of the Jacket </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To permit the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be easily placed on the heart H, the volume and shape of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are larger than the lower portion LP during diastole. So sized, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be easily slipped around the heart H. Once placed, the jacket&apos;s volume and shape are adjusted for the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to snugly conform to the external geometry of the heart H during diastole. Such sizing is easily accomplished due to the knit construction of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, excess material of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be gathered and sutured S&Prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to reduce the volume <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and conform the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the shape of the heart H during diastole. Such shape represents a maximum adjusted volume. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constrains enlargement of the heart H beyond the maximum adjusted volume while preventing restricted contraction of the heart H during systole. As an alternative to gathering of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be provided with other arrangements for adjusting and determining the volume of the jacket. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,343, the jacket can be provided with a slot. The jacket can alternatively include, for example, tension indicators as disclosed in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 09/400,018 or tensioning arrangements as disclosed in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 09/400,019. The entire disclosure of each of these applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adjusted to a snug fit on the heart H during diastole. Care is taken to avoid tightening the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> too much such that cardiac function is impaired. During diastole, the left ventricle LV fills with blood. If the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is too tight, the left ventricle LV cannot adequately expand and left ventricular pressure will rise. During the fitting of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the surgeon can monitor left ventricular pressure. For example, a well-known technique for monitoring so-called pulmonary wedge pressure uses a catheter placed in the pulmonary artery. The wedge pressure provides an indication of filling pressure in the left atrium LA and left ventricle LV. While minor increases in pressure (e.g., 2-3 mm Hg) can be tolerated, the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is snugly fit on the heart H but not so tight as to cause a significant increase in left ventricular pressure during diastole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> D. Delivery of the Jacket </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to methods and apparatuses for facilitating delivery or application of a jacket through procedures which are less invasive and less traumatic as compared to full stemotomy approaches. In general, an apparatus of the invention provides for compacting and passing a jacket through a minimally invasive opening into a patient&apos;s thorax and subsequently opening the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket for passing over the heart. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes arrangements to facilitate securing the jacket to the heart prior to removal of the apparatus from the thorax. The apparatuses of the invention can include a biasing member which provides for collapsing and opening the upper end of the jacket through the use of components which permit selective alteration of configurational states such as hinges, shape memory materials, elastic materials, springsteel, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a delivery tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> are schematic representations of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in longitudinal cross-section and showing only two diametrically opposed spacing arms (as will be described) and showing the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in open (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and closed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) positions (also, as will be described). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a distal end of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with attached jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> placed on a heart H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a proximal handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for hand-held manipulation by a surgeon. A plurality of attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are secured to the handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at a distal end of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are preferably blunt, non-piercing and smooth, such as smooth plastic knobs, to avoid trauma to the patient as the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are advanced toward the heart H as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Each of the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be individually attached to the handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a plurality of spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be strips of flexible, elongated shape memory materials having straight portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and outwardly curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this embodiment, the spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are flat, narrow sheets of spring metal having curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>configured for selective flexing toward and away from axis X-X. The proximal ends of the straight portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be secured to the handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are secured to distal ends of the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are secured to the handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for the straight portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be arranged in a closely compact cylindrical array around the longitudinal axis X-X of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the open position, the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>curve outwardly from the axis X-X. Thus, the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are disposed in a circular array around the axis X-X. In the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, all spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are of equal length. As a result the circular array of the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is in a plane perpendicular to the axis X-X. In an alternative embodiment, the lengths of the spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> could vary. The curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provide for attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to expand into an open configuration for attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be spaced from axis X-X by a distance substantially greater than the spacing of the straight portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the axis X-X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show one embodiment of a control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for controlling the position of the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> shown here is a tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which surrounds the straight portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is axially slidable along spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> toward and away from the distal end of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is moved distally, the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> slides over the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>urging the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the connected attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward axis X-X. When the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is moved proximally (i.e., the &ldquo;open position&rdquo;), the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is not covering the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. With the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in the open position, the shape memory biases the spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to urge the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the spaced-apart open array. When the tube <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is moved distally to cover and compress the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(i.e., the &ldquo;closed position&rdquo;), the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are urged to a compact array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> illustrate an alternative embodiment of a delivery tool <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, control arrangement <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which connect to attachment locations <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the free ends <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> passing through the handle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The surgeon can operate the drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by pulling free ends <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, pulling the drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> urges the curved portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of spacing arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the compact array position. Upon release of the drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the spacing arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> return to a rest position thereby moving the attachment locations <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the open array position. It will be appreciated that in the illustrated embodiment, the length of curved portions <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of spacing arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are not the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;posterior&rdquo; spacing arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are longer than the &ldquo;anterior&rdquo; spacing arms <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, unlike delivery tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the circular array of attachment locations <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are not in a plane perpendicular to axis X-X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Multiple drawstrings connected to separate sets of the attachment locations <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> could be employed. For example, the attachment locations <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> could be divided into anterior and posterior sets representing anterior and posterior placement of the attachment locations around the heart. Controlled by separate drawstrings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the anterior <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and posterior <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>sets could be separately manipulated by a surgeon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The operation of a tool of the invention will now be described with reference to the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. However, it will be appreciated that the following discussion is applicable to all tools of the invention. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a cardiac constraint device (such as jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) can be placed within the open array of the attachment locations. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the open upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is secured to the attachment locations by an attachment suture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> passed through the material of the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and further passed through holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The lower end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> faces the handle <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is surrounded by the curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>such that the jacket open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is held open sufficient to receive an apex A of the heart H when the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are in the open array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Having described the mounting of the jacket to delivery tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a surgical approach using tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will now be described. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the heart H is positioned behind the sternum ST and behind the lungs LU. The heart H rests on the diaphragm DI. Not separately shown, the heart H is surrounded by the pericardium which forms a sack around the heart H. The pericardium is attached to the diaphragm DI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The present procedure will be described using a sub-xyphoid approach. However, it will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to any procedure were a compact configuration of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is desired to advance the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> toward the heart H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The lower extremity of the sternum ST is called the xyphoid XI. Below the xyphoid, surgical access can be made to the chest cavity without need for a sternotomy. After making a sub-xyphoid incision (and after any desired pre-retraction of the lower end of the lung LU), a surgeon can use the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to pass the jacket through the incision and place the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the heart H. The placement of the jacket can be visualized using known throscopic instrumentation and visualization procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> By moving the control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the closed position, the distal end of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (with attached jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) can be inserted into the chest cavity through the incision and between the diaphragm DI and the lung LU. The jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, curved portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of spacer arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are all constrained within the compact array. The distal end of the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can now be advanced toward the apex A of the heart H through the restricted space of the chest cavity. During such advancement, the blunt attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> avoid trauma to thoracic structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The pericardium may be incised to permit access of the distal end to the apex A beneath the pericardium. When the distal end of tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is at the apex A, the control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is moved to the open position. The spacing arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> now urge the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the open array to open the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sufficient to receive the apex A. With the control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the open position, the distal end is passed around the apex A toward the base B of the heart H such that the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is passed onto the heart. During such movement, the blunt attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can urge the pericardium away from the heart H to create a space to receive the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> After the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fully placed on the heart H, sutures S are placed between the open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the heart H securing the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place on the heart. The attachment suture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is severed releasing the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can then be withdrawn. After the attachment locations <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> have passed the apex A, the control arrangement <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be moved to the closed position and the tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be withdrawn from the chest cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> With the present invention, access to the heart is made through a restricted space requiring a less traumatic surgical approach. Further, lifting and other substantial movement of the heart H can also be reduced or avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in an alternative embodiment, an attachment suture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as described above may not be used to attach jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the spacing arms of the tool. According to this embodiment, jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a hem <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> into which can be inserted the attachment locations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of spacing arms <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The previously described control arrangements and handles can be used according to this embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Alternative embodiments of the distal end of spacing arms suitable for the invention are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each of the embodiments can be used with the tools described herein. For purposes here, elements in common with each embodiment are similarly numbered (with the addition of single, double and triple apostrophes to distinguish the embodiments). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; terminates at the distal attachment location <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; having a hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; to receive an attachment suture such as suture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; is hollow to define an internal bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; having a radial outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime; facing the axis of the delivery tool. Therefore, in use, outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime; faces both the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heart H. A bio- or tissue-adhesive (e.g., fibrin glue) can be pumped through the bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime; and through outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime; to adhere the open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the heart H. Such glue can be used in conjunction with or in lieu of the sutures S of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&Prime; terminates at the distal attachment location <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&Prime; having a hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&Prime; to receive an attachment suture such as suture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&Prime; is hollow to define an internal bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&Prime; having a radial outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&Prime; facing the axis of the delivery tool. In use, outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&Prime; faces both the upper end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heart H. A coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime; of metal or other suitable material is held in a straight configuration in the bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&Prime; against the natural coiling bias of the coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime;. A push rod <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>&Prime; is slidably positioned in the bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&Prime; to push the coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime; out of outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&Prime; (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). When pushed out of outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&Prime;, the coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime; penetrates through both the open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heart H and assumes its coiled shape thereby attaching the open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the heart H. Such a coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be used in conjunction with or in lieu of the sutures S of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; terminates at the distal attachment location <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The spacing arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is hollow to define an internal bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; having a radial outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; facing the axis of the delivery tool. In use, outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; faces both the open end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the jacket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heart H. A rod <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is disposed in bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; with a hooked end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; at the outlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;.
