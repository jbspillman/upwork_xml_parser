<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a liquid coater that applies liquid to target objects by delivering mists (liquid minute particles) in a container. Particularly, the present invention relates to a liquid coater that applies a cutting oil to a cutting edge of a machine tool such as a machining center, a grinding machine, or a lathe. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, oil has been applied to target objects such as workpieces and tools in order to improve machining accuracy and to extend tool life in machining. In a method of applying liquid oil directly toward target objects, an excessive amount of oil has been applied and it has taken time to remove extra oil, thus decreasing productivity. Furthermore, since the extra oil floats up around a coater, a countermeasure for preventing a working environment from getting worse has been necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When applying oil in a drop-state, machining can be conducted with a very small (minimum necessary) amount of oil, thus not only improving machining accuracy and productivity, but also leading to the improvement of a working environment and the simplification of a plant. An example of coaters that can apply oil in a drop-state is proposed in Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application Jikkai Hei 5-92596. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in an oil feeder mentioned above, it has been necessary to provide a casing for an oil dropping part, a passage for a high-speed gas, a Venturi nozzle and the like in a mist generating section. In addition, since an oil tank has been constructed individually, the configuration has been complicated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Object of the present invention is to provide a liquid coater excellent in fast-response that can generate fine mists with a simple configuration by simplifying the configuration of a mist generating section and that can convey the mists at a high speed by providing a gas feed passage. The problems mentioned above can be solved by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to attain the object mentioned above, a first liquid coater of the present invention comprises: a mist feed nozzle for feeding mists into a container; a gas feed passage for feeding gas into the container; and a mist conveying passage for conveying the mists pressurized by the gas inside the container to the outside of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the first liquid coater, droplets and large mist particles fed from the mist feed nozzle can be trapped inside the container and therefore only fine mist particles can be conveyed to the outside of the container. The fine mist particles do not adhere on the wall surface of the conveying passage easily. Therefore, it is easy to convey the fine mist particles. In addition, the conveying speed at which the fine mist particles are conveyed can be accelerated by the gas fed from the gas feed passage. Consequently, the mist conveyance is excellent in fast-response and the mists can be conveyed at a high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the first liquid coater mentioned above, it is preferable that a discharge part with a narrowed tip is connected to the end of the mist conveying passage. When such a discharge part is connected, flow velocity increases at the discharge part, thus enlarging the particle size of the fine mists and changing the fine mists into droplets. Consequently, these large mist particles and droplets can be applied to target objects and therefore it is easy to make liquid adhere to the target objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the mist feed nozzle has a double tube structure comprising a gas tube in which gas flows and a liquid tube in which liquid flows that extends inside the gas tube, and the end of the liquid tube is positioned inward compared to the end of the gas tube. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, mists can be generated with a simple configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that mists are generated at a space between the end of the liquid tube and the end of the gas tube by mixing a liquid discharged from the liquid tube and a gas flowing inside the gas tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that a gas flow-regulating valve is connected to the gas feed passage. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, the mist conveying speed can be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is further preferable that liquid for generating mists is collected in the container and flows into a liquid pump connected to the container, and the liquid discharged from the liquid pump goes through the mist feed nozzle and is fed as mists into the container. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, the liquid can be circulated efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that an opening part of the end of the mist conveying passage faces to the surface of the collected liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the distance between the end of the mist conveying passage inside the container and the surface of the collected liquid can be regulated. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, the size of mist particles flowing into the mist conveying passage can be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the liquid pump is integrated with the container at the bottom of the container. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, a small-size coater can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferable that the end of the mist feed nozzle is arranged so that mists are injected from the mist feed nozzle toward the inner-wall side face of the container. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, since the injected mists circulate along the inner-wall side face, a centrifugal force is strongly applied to large mist particles and droplets injected together with the mists. Therefore, the mists and the droplets adhere to the inner-wall side face easily, thus preventing the large mist particles and the droplets from flowing into the mist conveying passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the container is formed in a cylindrical shape. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, it is easy to circulate mists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the end of the mist conveying passage inside the container is provided almost at the center in the horizontal direction of the container. Since a mist conveying passage is arranged as mentioned above, fine mist particles gathering at the center can be conveyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is further preferable that a partition in which a flow-through hole is formed is provided in the horizontal direction of the container, the container is divided into an upper part and a lower part by the partition, a liquid reservoir is provided below the partition, and the mist feed nozzle, the gas feed passage, and the mist conveying passage are provided above the partition. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, since the liquid surface is not disturbed in the liquid reservoir, mists with a stable mist-particle size can be conveyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferable that a pipe is provided at a part of the partition in the vertical direction and the pipe enables the gas in the upper part and the lower part to be circulated. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, since oil can be dropped promptly at the time of refueling, the coater can be started quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A second liquid coater of the present invention generates mists from liquid in a container and discharges the mists to the outside of the container. The liquid coater comprises: a lower nozzle having a gas injection port in the liquid; an upper nozzle having a gas injection port in the upper part of the container; and a mist conveying passage provided in the upper part of the container, which conveys mists in the container to the outside of the container. Mists are generated by injecting gas from the gas injection port of the lower nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the second liquid coater, mists can be generated with a simple configuration, and an oil-circulating pump is not required. Therefore, the coater itself can be simplified. Since the upper nozzle is provided, large mist particles and droplets are prevented from rising in the container and disturbances at the liquid surface can be reduced. Consequently, large mist particles and droplets can be prevented from flowing into the mist conveying passage. Furthermore, by injecting gas from the upper nozzle, the mist conveying speed can be increased more than that limited by the lower nozzle, thus regulating the mist conveying speed in a wide range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the second liquid coater mentioned above, it is preferable that a discharge part with a narrowed tip is connected to the end of the mist conveying passage. When such a discharge part is connected, flow velocity increases at the discharge part, thus enlarging the particle size of fine mists and changing the fine mists into droplets. Consequently, these large mist particles and droplets can be applied to target objects and therefore it is easy to make liquid adhere to the target objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the gas injection port of the upper nozzle and the gas injection port of the lower nozzle are arranged so that gas is injected toward the inner-wall side face of the container from both the gas injection ports. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, since generated mists circulate along the inner-wall side face, a centrifugal force is strongly applied to large mist particles and droplets injected together with the mists. Therefore, the mists and the droplets adhere to the inner-wall side face easily, thus preventing the large mist particles and the droplets from flowing into the mist conveying passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the container is formed in a cylindrical shape. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, it is easy to circulate mists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the directions of the gas injection port of the upper nozzle and of the gas injection port of the lower nozzle are arranged so that circulating directions of the gas injected from the gas injection port of the upper nozzle and of the gas injected from the gas injection port of the lower nozzle are opposite to each other. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, since the circulating directions are opposite to each other, the circulation caused by the gas injected from the lower nozzle is partially canceled by the gas injected from the upper nozzle, or the circulation power is decreased. Therefore, large mist particles and droplets distributed in the vicinity of the inner-wall side face can be prevented from rising within the container, and disturbance at the liquid surface can be reduced, thus reducing large mist particles and droplets flowing into the mist conveying passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is further preferable that a reticulated filter is provided in the horizontal direction inside the container and the container is divided into an upper part and a lower part by the filter. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, the filter is provided, thus reducing large mist particles and droplets generated by the gas injected from the lower nozzle flowing into the mist conveying passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that a gas flow-regulating valve is connected to at least one of the upper and lower nozzles. According to such a liquid coater as mentioned above, an amount of mists, a size of mist particles, and a mist conveying speed can be regulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the end of the mist conveying passage inside the container is provided almost at the center in the horizontal direction of the container. Since a mist conveying passage is arranged as mentioned above, fine mist particles gathering at the center can be conveyed.</paragraph>

In an airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an oil mist feed port <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an air feed port <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and an oil mist outlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed. A mist feed tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided at the oil mist feed port <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The mist feed tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to the oil pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is arranged so that the end of the mist feed tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is located inside the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the end of the mist feed tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> inside the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the end of the oil tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is located inward compared to the end of the air tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by a length A. The length A is preferably about 20-40 mm. The space indicated by this length A forms a nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> At the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, oil that flows from the oil pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through the oil tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by an arrow a and is discharged from the end of the oil tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and air flowing through the air tube <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by an arrow b are mixed to form oil mists and the oil mists are fed into the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided to the air inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. One end of the air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the air source <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) via the air flow-regulating valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), and the other end is located inside the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with the air flow-regulating valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Air flowing inside the air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by an arrow b is fed into the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is oriented in the vertical direction. The mist intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is the lower end of the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> faces to the liquid surface of collected oil. The mist intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is spaced from the liquid surface by a distance B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the upper end of the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the oil mist outlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The mist conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is piped toward an outside oil supply part S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It will be explained as follows how the coater operates while oil mists flow into the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and are spouted to the outside of the coater. The oil mist particles fed from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have various sizes from small to large. Not only a mist-state oil but also a drop-state oil is fed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Mists and oil droplets drop from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>due to gravity. Compared to the fall velocity due to gravity of large mist particles and oil droplets, the fall velocity due to gravity of fine oil mists is slow and the fine oil mists stay longer inside the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The fine oil mists are defined as smoke-like mists capable of drifting in the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The inside of the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is pressurized by an air pressure from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an air pressure from the air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the fine oil mists that do not reach to the bottom of the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and that are remaining in the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are susceptible to the pressurization and move in the direction shown by an arrow d. Then the fine oil mists flow through the mist intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and are conveyed into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Large oil mist particles and oil droplets drop to the bottom of the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> quickly and are not susceptible to the air pressure. Therefore, these large oil mist particles and oil droplets do not easily flow into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The oil mists flow through the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and are conveyed to the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sequentially. The oil mists conveyed through each conveying pipe are fine oil mists as mentioned above and therefore can be conveyed at a high speed and the oil mists do not adhere easily to the wall surfaces of the pipes. Consequently, the fine mists can go through the conveying pipes in a short time, even if there is a long distance to an object on which oil is supplied and the conveying pipes are long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After going through the outside mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the oil mists pass through the discharge part whose diameter is narrowed down, thus increasing the velocity. Therefore, the particle size of the oil mists is enlarged, or the oil mists are changed to oil droplets depending on how narrow the diameter of the discharge part is set. As mentioned above, the particle size of the oil mists is changed or the oil mists are changed into oil droplets. The reason is that when the fine oil mists, i.e. the smoke-like oil mists that drift in the air are discharged without changing the particle size, most of the fine oil mist particles do not adhere to the object on which oil should be supplied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example in which the oil mists after flowing through as mentioned above are spouted from a tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an outlet. The tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to, for example, a spindle (not shown in the figure) of a machining center connected to the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Since oil mists having an enlarged particle size or oil droplets are spouted from the end of the tool <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, they adhere to workpieces easily. Consequently, the workpieces can be processed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The oil mists flowing into the spindle from the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have a fine particle size as mentioned above. Therefore, the oil mists are not susceptible to the centrifugal force caused by the spindle that rotates at a high speed, thus preventing the spindle from being blocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the pressure of the air flowing inside the air hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set to be the same as that of the air flowing inside the tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the oil mists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the height B of the intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>changes, the particle size of the oil mists that can be taken into the inside mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also changes. Therefore, by changing the inside mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to other pipes having various lengths, the height B of the intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be adjusted, thus regulating the particle size of the oil mists taken in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At the bottom of the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, oil that is collected in advance or that has dropped from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is collected. Depending on the amount of this collected oil, the flowing condition of the oil mists flowing out from the outside mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> changes. Therefore, the particle size of the oil mists also can be regulated by increasing the amount of the oil fed from the outside or by changing the size of the airtight container <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Each mist-conveying pipe may be integrated to form one pipe. Similarly, in this case, the height B of the intake <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be changed by replacing the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The outside mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not limited to one pipe. A plurality of pipes may be provided. In this case, the intermediate oil mist outflow pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should be branched into a plurality of pipes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A mist feed tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is different from an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. An air tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is forked and ports <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed. An oil tube <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is inserted into the air tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the port <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thus, the mist feed tube <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a double wall structure. The oil tube <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to an oil pump. The port <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to an air source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The oil feeder of the present example can be used in any machine tools when the oil feeder is connected to an oil tank in which oil is collected via an oil pump. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of a primary portion of an oil feeder according to Example <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the present invention. An airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a body that is formed in a cylindrical shape. An oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to the bottom of the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by arranging pipes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At an intermediate part of the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is arranged in the horizontal direction. The airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is divided into an upper part and a lower part by the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In the part below the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in which oil is collected is formed. In the part above the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in which oil mists circulate is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A mist feed port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an air feed port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and an oil feed port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed in the top panel of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the oil mist inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a mist feed tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is arranged toward the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the air feed port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, an air hose <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> that is connected to an air source <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> directly via an air flow-regulating valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, an oil mist outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed at the center of the top panel of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In the oil mist outlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, an oil mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is directed toward the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the vertical direction, and a mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that supplies oil mists to an outside tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The mist feed tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a double structure in which an oil tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed inside an air tube <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> like the mist feed tube <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for oil mists is piped to the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The opening part of an outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>a is directed toward the inner-wall side face of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The position of the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set so that injected oil mists can circulate along the inner-wall side face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the end of the oil tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is located inward compared to the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by about 20-40 mm. The space between the end of the oil tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a nozzle part <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. At the nozzle part <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, oil that flows out from the oil tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and air that flows out from the air tube <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are mixed to form oil mists. These oil mists are injected into the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has the same shape and pipe arrangement as those in the oil pump <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in Example 1. Oil collected inside the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fed to the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the air hose <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> also is piped to the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The opening part of the outlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>of the air hose <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is directed toward the inner-wall side face of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> as that of the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The position of the outlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set so that injected air can circulate along the inner-wall side face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A flow-through hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed at the center of the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Oil fed from an oil feed port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> goes through the flow-through hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and drops into the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Further, since a pipe-like air passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> goes through a part of the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, air can flow between the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The principle in which oil and air are fed from the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to form oil mists and then the oil mists flow into the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is the same as that in Example 1. Therefore, a detailed explanation is omitted. The oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to the bottom of the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are integrated. Therefore, the oil feeder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be made small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Most oil sucked up by the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is injected into the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in a mist state from the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for oil mists. It will be explained as follows how the oil feeder operates while oil mists are fed into the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and are discharged to the outside of the feeder. Oil mists injected from the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>circulate along the inner-wall side face of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Similarly, air injected from the outlet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the air hose <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> also circulates along the inner-wall side face of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The oil mists fed from the outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have various particle sizes from small to large. Not only a mist-state oil but also a drop-state oil is fed. Most of the large oil mist particles and oil droplets drop due to gravity. A part of the oil mists circulating along the inner-wall side face adheres to the inner-wall side face due to the influence of the centrifugal force caused by the circulation. According to the principle of the centrifugal force, the larger the particle size of oil mists is, the easier the oil mists adhere to the inner-wall side face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The inside of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressurized by an air pressure from the nozzle part <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and an air pressure from the air hose <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the oil mists circulating inside the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are conveyed into the inside oil-mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, large oil mist particles and oil droplets drop due to gravity or adhere to the inner-wall side face due to the influence of the centrifugal force. Therefore, most of the oil mists conveyed into the inside oil-mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are smoke-like fine oil mists capable of drifting in the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is preferable that the inside oil-mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is arranged at the center of the airtight container <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The reason is that large oil mist particles and oil droplets drop due to the gravity or adhere to the inner-wall side face due to the influence of the centrifugal force before reaching to the center of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and therefore are prevented from reaching to the center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The operation after conveying oil mists into the oil mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is the same as in Example 1. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example in which the circulated oil mists are spouted out from a tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provided with a discharge opening. The tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is attached to, for example, a spindle (not shown in the figure) of a machining center connected to the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Oil mists having an enlarged particle size or oil droplets are spouted out from the tip of the tool <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the oil mists or the oil droplets adhere to workpieces easily, and thus the workpieces can be processed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Generally, the oil pump <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> does not operate continuously but operates intermittently. Oil mists and air injected into the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> tend to disturb the surface of oil at the bottom of the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the oil surface is disturbed, oil droplets are formed. The oil droplets flow into the mist-conveying pipe in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the present example, the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are divided by the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Therefore, oil mists circulate mainly in the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, thus preventing the oil in the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from being disturbed. Thus, stable oil mists can be supplied even at the time of starting the oil pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Oil refueled from the oil feed port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes the flow-through hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the partition <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is collected in the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the air pressure of the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is applied to the flow-through hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the oil circulates slowly, thus delaying the oil feed accordingly. Such delay delays the start of the operation of the oil feeder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the present example, the air passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through which the oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> communicate is provided. Consequently, the air in the airtight oil chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be circulated into the oil mist chamber <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and therefore oil can be fed without delay at the time of refueling oil, thus quickening the start of the oil feeder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

A certain amount of oil <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is filled into the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is immersed in the oil <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided with a filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. By fitting the peripheral part of the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the inner-wall side face of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is divided into an upper part and a lower part by the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> injects gas that has passed inside the tube <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by arrows e and g from a gas source (not shown in the figure). Generally, air is used as the gas. The upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> injects gas that has passed inside the tube <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by arrows e and f The amount of gas injected from each nozzle can be controlled by regulating gas flow-regulating valves <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment will be explained in detail using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of the liquid coater shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in the vertical direction. When injecting gas into the oil <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the oil <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is splashed and entrained by this injected gas and is atomized and diffused from the liquid surface. Thus, the oil <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is changed to mists. An internal pressure is applied inside the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by the gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the generated mists are eventually conveyed to the outside of the container through the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The flow of the injected gas and the mists will be explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken on line II-II in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The gas injection port of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is provided at an off-center position in the horizontal direction of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Further, the end of the gas injection port of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> faces to the inner-wall side face so that the injected gas circulates along the inner-wall side face after colliding with the inner-wall side face. That is to say, the gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> collides with the inner-wall side face of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and then rises while circulating along the inner-wall side face in the rotation direction shown by an arrow i. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> At the part above the liquid surface in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the injected gas continues to rise together with generated mists while circulating along the inner-wall side face in the rotation direction shown by an arrow i as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The particle sizes of the generated mists vary. Oil droplets also are atomized and diffused from the liquid surface. Most of the mists and a part of the oil droplets rise while circulating as mentioned above. However, the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> prevents mists having a larger particle size than a certain size and oil droplets from rising. As the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, for example, a filter formed of metal wires in a braided form is used. It is preferable that the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> has a smaller mesh size in order to separate mists having a large particle size. However, when the mesh size is too small, conversely, essentially necessary mists also are separated. Therefore, it is necessary to secure a larger mesh size than a certain size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Thus, large mist particles and oil droplets can not be separated completely, and a part of them further rises to the upper side of the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. According to the result of a test conducted with gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> stopped, most of the large mist particles and the oil droplets rise in an oil-drop state adhering to the inner-wall side face or rise while circulating in the vicinity of the inner-wall side face. Therefore, when providing the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> almost at the center in the horizontal direction of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the large mist particles and the oil droplets can be prevented from flowing into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In order further to reduce the large mist particles and the droplets flowing into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided. The movement of the gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> will be explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> as follows. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken on line I-I in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is omitted in the figure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The gas injection port of the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided at an off-center position in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Further, the end of the gas injection port of the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> faces to the inner-wall side face so that injected gas circulates along the inner-wall side face after colliding with the inner-wall side face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is inclined slightly downward with respect to the horizontal direction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). By setting the position and angle of the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in such a manner, the flow of gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> collides with the inner-wall side face of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and then descends while circulating along the inner-wall side face in the rotation direction shown by an arrow j (in the opposite direction to the rotation direction shown by the arrow i) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The circulating flow of the gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in the rotation direction shown by the arrow i and the circulating flow from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by the arrow j that is opposite to the direction shown by the arrow i flow together inside the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. When referring to the inner-wall side face as an example, large mist particles and oil droplets adhering to the inner-wall side face that tend to rise are pushed back along the inner-wall side face or rise slowly due to the circulating flow of the gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that tends to descend in the rotation direction shown by the arrow j. Thus, the large mist particles and the oil droplets on the inner-wall side face or in the vicinity of the inner-wall side face can be prevented from flowing into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> According to the set value of the injecting amount of each nozzle, the circulation caused by the gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is partially cancelled or is slowed by the gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Thus, the disturbance at the liquid surface by the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> can be prevented and therefore the generation of large mist particles and oil droplets can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Due to the gas injected from both the upper and the lower nozzles, the circulation momentum itself is weakened. However, since gas is injected from both the upper and the lower nozzles, the internal pressure in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> increases compared to the case where gas is injected only from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the rising momentum of mists increases conversely, and the mists in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> flow into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> with stronger momentum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In other words, due to the gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, not only large mist particles and oil droplets are prevented from flowing into the mist-conveying pipe, but also the conveying speed can be accelerated. When only increasing the amount of gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the disturbance at the liquid surface becomes too big. Therefore, it is necessary to restrain the amount of gas injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to a certain amount or less. However, the mist discharging velocity can be increased beyond the limitation of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> by injecting gas from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Thus, the mist conveying speed can be regulated in a wide range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this case, large mist particles and oil droplets included in mists generated tend to gather on the inner-wall side face or in the vicinity of the inner-wall side face, and fine mists tend to gather at the center as mentioned above. The large mist particles and the oil droplets on the inner-wall side face or in the vicinity of the inner-wall side face are prevented from rising by gas injected from the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is provided at the center in the horizontal direction of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the large mist particles and the oil droplets can be prevented from flowing into the mist-conveying pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the present example, air is injected from the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and mists are generated directly from the oil present at the bottom of the container. Therefore, it is not necessary to circulate the oil. As a result, an oil circulating pump, pipes necessary for the pump, and the like are not required, thus simplifying the coater itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> When continuing the operation of this coater and discharging mists through the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, the oil is consumed and the liquid level goes down. However, oil can be replenished by removing the liquid injection port cap <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The flow of oil mists after being conveyed into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is the same as in Examples <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The oil mists are conveyed to the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> through the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The oil mists after passing through the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> pass through the discharge part <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> whose diameter is narrowed down with respect to the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Oil mists having a enlarged particle size or oil droplets are discharged from the discharge part <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the oil mists or the oil droplets adhere to workpieces easily and thus the workpieces can be processed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, oil is filled in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. However, even if filling another liquid, for example, water, mists can be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are provided in the top panel. However, it is not always necessary to provide them in the top panel as long as they are provided in the upper part of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is provided in the bottom of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. However, the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be provided so as to extend from the upper part of the container as long as the gas injection port of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is in the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, one lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is provided. However, a plurality of lower nozzles may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is used inside the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. However, the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be used without a filter when the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a certain height or more. This is because large mist particles and oil droplets drop due to the gravity before reaching the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It is possible to regulate the mist amount, the mist particle size, and the mist conveying speed by controlling the amount of injected gas by gas flow-regulating valves <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be made using a more detailed example as follows. In this example, a container had a cylindrical shape, an outer diameter of 120 mm, an inner diameter of 100 mm, and a height of 350 mm. The amount of oil to be filled in the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> was an amount for filling the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so that the oil level is at a position of 30 mm from the bottom of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this case, the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> was immersed in the oil. A cutting oil was used as the oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The diameter of each gas injection port of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> was set to 1.7 mm. The inner diameter of the end of the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> inside the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> was set to about 11.5 mm (JIS gas pipe &frac14;&Prime;). The port of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> was set so as to be located at an off-center position shifted from the center of the bottom of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by 35 mm. The port of the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> was set so as to be located at an off-center position shifted from the center of the top panel of the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by 35 mm. The direction of the port of each nozzle was set so that the circulation directions of the gas discharged from the nozzles were opposite to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The end of the tube <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (a total length of 3 m) for the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> was attached to a spindle of a machining center. A tool having two oil discharge openings was attached to the tip of this spindle. The diameter of each oil discharge opening was set to 1.0 mm. The filter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> was provided inside the container <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and its mesh size was 150 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The upstream air feed pressure was set to 5.5 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The discharge flow-volume of the lower nozzle <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> was set to 78NL/min and the discharge flow-volume of the upper nozzle <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> was set to 22NL/min. In this case, the pressure inside the container was 4.3 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Using a liquid coater that was set as mentioned above, generated mists were changed to oil droplets and were discharged from the oil discharge openings locating at the tip of the tool attached to the spindle. In this case, when the particle diameters of the mists are relatively small and almost uniform, the mists are not susceptible to the centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the spindle. Consequently, most of the mists do not remain in the spindle and are discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> However, when mists having a large particle size that is a certain particle size or more or oil droplets are mixed in the mists, they adhere to the inner wall of the spindle by the centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the spindle. As a result, the mists remain inside the spindle and can not be discharged sufficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In this example, even when changing the rotating speed of the spindle within the range of 0-6000 rpm, mists do not remain inside the spindle. The mists can be discharged after being changed to oil droplets within about 1 second from the operation start of the coater. The discharging condition was good. Therefore, according to the present example, it can be conceivable that the mists that have flown into the mist-conveying pipe <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> have a relatively small particle size and are almost uniform. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the liquid coater of the present invention can generate fine mists with a simple configuration by simplifying the structure of the mist generating part and can convey the mists at a high speed by providing a gas feed passage. Therefore, the liquid coater is excellent in fast-response. Thus, the liquid coater can be utilized as an oil feeder for feeding a cutting oil to a cutting edge of a machine tool such as a machining center, a grinding machine, or a lathe. </paragraph>
