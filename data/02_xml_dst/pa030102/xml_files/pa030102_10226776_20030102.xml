<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to internal combustion engines, and more particularly to release mechanisms for engine valves of internal combustion engines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a normal four stroke pull-start engine, a starting event moves the engine through one or more engine cycles to start the engine. The starting event may involve a person pulling a pull cord, or an electric starter, rotating the engine. The engine cycle has four strokes: the intake stroke, the compression stroke, the expansion stroke, and the exhaust stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> During normal engine operation, an air/fuel mixture is ignited just before the expansion stroke to power the engine and move the engine through the engine cycle. During pull starting, the operator must exert enough force to overcome the resistive force of the compressed air in the combustion chamber during the combustion stroke. The additional force required to compress the air increases the torque on the cord and makes the engine more difficult to start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A compression release mechanism may be used to release pressure in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke, which reduces the torque and resistive force on the cord. The reduced torque makes the engine easier to start because the operator does not have to exert as large of a force on the pull cord to move the engine through the cycle. Typically, a compression release mechanism slightly unseats an engine valve to vent the combustion chamber during the compression stroke while the engine is rotating at starting speeds. The compression release mechanism generally disengages at or before the engine reaches normal operating speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the compression release mechanism is to reduce the torque on the cord by releasing the pressure in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke. Since the combustion chamber is relatively airtight when the engine valves are closed, the release of pressure during the compression stroke creates a partial vacuum in the combustion chamber for the expansion stroke. When starting an engine having a compression release mechanism, the operator must exert enough force on the pull cord during the expansion stroke to pull the piston against the partial vacuum in the combustion chamber. The additional force required to overcome the partial vacuum during the expansion stroke creates a torque and the resistive force on the cord, and makes the engine more difficult to start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In some prior art engines, the compression release mechanism may be pivotally retained to the cam shaft with a pin. An aperture extends through the cam shaft, and the pin extends through the aperture. The pin is connected to the compression release member, and retains the compression release member to the cam shaft. The compression release member may pivot about a pivot axis which extends through the pin. Both the pin, and the pivot axis of the some prior art compression release members intersect with the cam shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Creating an aperture through a cam shaft is generally a difficult machining operation. The cam shaft is generally made from a relatively hard and strong material that may be difficult to machine. A harder material is generally more difficult to machine than a softer material. Additionally, the cam shaft is generally round and cylindrical, and machining into a round surface to create an aperture may also be difficult. The round surface tends to deflect a drill tip, and increase the difficulty of maintaining the center line of a drilled hole through the cam shaft. Machining an aperture into a round surface of a hard material creates many manufacturing problems, such as scrapped parts and excessive tool wear. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A retainer retains a release member for an internal combustion engine. The retainer comprises a cam shaft, and a cam assembly including a cam driving member. The cam driving member may be a cam gear, a pulley, or other means. A pin retains the release member to the cam lobe or the cam driving member. The pin is substantially transverse to the cam shaft, and does not intersect the cam shaft. Preferably, the release member is centrifugally responsive, and pivots about the pin. The release member may be a compression release member, a vacuum release member, or a similar release member that at least partially vents an engine combustion chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, machining an aperture through the cam shaft may present several manufacturing problems, due to the hardness and rounded surface of the cam shaft. In the preferred embodiment, since the pin does not intersect the cam shaft, the retainer does not require any additional machining of the cam shaft. Therefore, many of the problems associated with machining the cam shaft may be avoided. The release member retainer of the preferred embodiment may be manufactured more efficiently than some prior art release members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, the release member is preferably L-shaped, and is pivotally retained to the cam lobe. A pin extends through the release member, and is interconnected to the cam lobe. The release member may pivot about the pin. The pin does not intersect the cam shaft. In the first embodiment, the release member may include a separate compression release member and vacuum release member. Each release member may have a separate pin, however, neither pin intersects the cam shaft. Alternatively, nubs may be used to retain the release members to the cam lobe. The release members may pivot about the nubs, but the pivot axis of the release members will not intersect the cam shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the release member is preferably a U-shaped yoke and at least partially surrounds the cam shaft. A pin extends through the yoke and pivotally retains the yoke to the cam gear. Bosses project from the cam gear, and the pin extends into apertures within the bosses. The yoke may pivot about the pin, and the pin does not intersect the cam shaft. Preferably, the pin is substantially transverse to the cam shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the release member is preferably a U-shaped yoke and includes a first end, a second end, and two legs extending between the first and second end. The yoke at least partially surrounds the cam shaft. Each leg preferably includes a U-shaped recess. A pin extends through the U-shaped recesses, and pivotally retains the yoke to the cam gear. The pin extends through the recesses and into apertures in the cam gear. Preferably, the pin is substantially C-shaped, and the apertures extend in the axial direction of the cam gear. The yoke may pivot about the pin, and the pin does not intersect the cam shaft. The pin is preferably substantially transverse to the cam shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pin is substantially C-shaped and includes an elongated middle portion and at least one end portion. The end portion extends into an aperture in the cam gear, and may include barbs that engage the cam gear to interconnect the pin to the cam gear. Alternatively, the end portion may extend through the aperture, and a nut may engage the end portion on the opposite side of the cam gear to retain the end portion within the aperture. Alternatively, the end portion may include clips having barbs at the end of a flexible extension. The barbs may bend inwardly to permit the end portion to be inserted through the aperture. Once the barbs are through the aperture, the barbs bend back outwardly to engage the cam gear and retain the end portion within the aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the cam gear may include mounts that project from the cam gear and retain a substantially straight pin. The pin is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft. The mounts may include two bendable tabs that clamp the pin to the mount, and a stop that retains the pin in the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the retainer and release member may be interconnected to the cam assembly at a location remote from the cam driving member.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Several embodiments of a release member and a retainer are illustrated in the figures. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrate a first embodiment of a release member. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> illustrate a second embodiment of a release member. FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> illustrate a third embodiment of a release member. FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrate a fourth embodiment of a release member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a centrifugally-responsive vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pivotable between an engaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a disengaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be used with an engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) utilizing a direct lever overhead valve system, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/507,070 filed Feb. 18, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. The cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a side face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and rotates about a cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, it is not necessary for the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to rotate, or for the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be fastened to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may remain stationary while the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates about the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is spring biased to contact the side face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates. The cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> does not rotate with the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in relation to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends further from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> than the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is centrifugally responsive, and is pivotably retained to the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pivot between an engaged position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and a disengaged position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position, and extends beyond the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to separate the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is substantially L-shaped, and has an engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that each extend outward from a bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is substantially U-shaped, and interconnects the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a relatively flat segment having a cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> disposed at an end of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> opposite the bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends beyond the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and engages the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are both arc-shaped to provide a smooth transition for the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> between the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The smooth curved surfaces of the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> reduce the wear and extend the life of the parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extends from the end of the bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> opposite the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and has a mass sufficient to pivot the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in response to engine speed. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is larger than the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. However, the size of the portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be varied depending on the desired kick-out speed of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. A curved end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at the end of the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> opposite the bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and bends to face back toward the bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The curved end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> concentrates mass near the end of the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and shifts the center of gravity of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> toward the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The increased mass and shifted center of gravity lowers the kick-out speed and causes the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot to the disengaged position at a lower engine speed than if the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> was the same size as the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The size and mass of the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be modified to achieve a desired center of gravity and alter the kick-out speed, causing the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot to the disengaged position at a desired speed. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably made from stamped metal and is bent into a desired shape, or is cut and bent from a metal roll. The stamping and bending process for manufacturing the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is relatively inexpensive. Bending the curved end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provides sufficient clearance for the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and concentrates the mass near the curved end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to shift the center of gravity. Alternatively, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made from powdered metal, die casting, or another metal forming process, and the thickness or composition of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be modified to obtain a desired center of gravity. The flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can also be made from a material having a higher density than the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. In a multi-density embodiment, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be similar in size, but because of the higher density material, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can still have a greater mass than the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that is partially formed in the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and extends radially inward toward the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed within the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and is pivotally retained by a pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is partially disposed within the curved bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is free to pivot about the pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has two side walls <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a back surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> preferably extends between the side walls <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be pivotally retained within the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with nubs. The nubs project inward into the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from side walls of the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may pivot about the nubs. The pivot axis of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes through the nubs, and is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is disposed near the intersection of the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> contacts the shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and the shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provides support for the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In a vertical shaft engine, gravity biases the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> toward the engaged position and a return spring is not necessary. A return spring may be needed in a non-vertical shaft engine embodiment to bias the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> toward the engaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is spring biased to contact the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> separates the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the spring biased cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> exerts a force on the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Most of the force exerted on the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is transferred to the back surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and is not absorbed by the pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The bridging portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> contacts the back surface <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which buttresses the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and absorbs most of the force the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> applies on the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This embodiment preferably does not apply large shear stresses on the pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and may extend the life of the pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotate about the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rotates. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is interconnected to an engine valve, although they could be separate components. The term &ldquo;engine valve&rdquo; may refer to an exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, an intake valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, or both. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably affects movement of the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, but the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can alternatively be used to affect the movement of the intake valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The greater the distance the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> moves away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the more the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opens the respective engine valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is moved a greater distance from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, than when the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the normal engine cycle, as described below, the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is timed to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and unseat the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the engine exhaust stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Similarly, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is also moved a greater distance from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, than when the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The distance the cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends beyond the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> determines how far the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> separates the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and how far the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opens the respective engine valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generally displaces the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> a greater distance than the base radius <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> displaces the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In embodiments incorporated into other engines, the cam follower may move toward the cam shaft to open the valve, instead of away. In these embodiments, the cam follower will move closer to the cam shaft when the cam follower contacts the vacuum release member, than when the cam follower contacts the base radius. The cam lobe will displace the cam follower and the valve a greater distance than the vacuum release member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the width of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> determines the amount of time the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> separates the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The wider the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the longer period of time the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and separates the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may have an extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that extends the cam surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially tangential to the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is illustrated in broken lines to show the alternate embodiment; A vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having the extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> would separate the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a longer period of time than a vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without an extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which would thereby open the respective engine valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) for a longer period of time. Additional clearance from the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be needed to permit the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the extension <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to pivot between the engaged and disengaged positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a reciprocable piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> disposed within a cylinder <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and a crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is also disposed within the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are disposed near an end of the cylinder <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is disposed between the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is timed to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and unseat the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke when the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving away from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and toward the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) opens the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> less during the expansion stroke than the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> opens the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the exhaust stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates a graph representing the engine valve lift, cylinder pressure, and pull force in relation to the crank degrees of the engine cycle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 18</cross-reference> together illustrate various conditions occurring within the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during the engine cycle. Engine cycle crank degrees is represented as 720 degrees because the crankshaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> completely rotates twice for each engine cycle. 0 degrees to 180 degrees represents the expansion stroke during which the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving away from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and toward the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. 180 degrees to 360 degrees represents the exhaust stroke during which the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving away from the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and toward the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. 360 degrees to 540 degrees represents the intake stroke during which the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving away from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and toward the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. 540 degrees to 720 degrees represents the compression stroke during which the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving away from the crankcase <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and toward the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The valve lift represents the distance in inches that the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or the intake valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is moved from each valve&apos;s respective seat. The term &ldquo;lift&rdquo; should not be construed to mean vertical movement. &ldquo;Lift&rdquo; merely refers to the movement of the engine valves, and the movement may be in any direction depending on the orientation of the engine and valves. A lift of 0 represents a closed, or seated, position. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, exhaust valve lift <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> illustrates the distance the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is moved from its seat while the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are in the engaged position. The intake valve lift <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> illustrates the distance the intake valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is moved from its seat. The valve lifts <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> graphed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> represent the approximate valve lift for the illustrated embodiment of a <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> hp engine of the direct lever type. The actual valve lift for an engine will greatly depend upon the size and configuration of the engine. Additionally, the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> must overcome valve lash when opening, and do not actually open to permit air flow until the valve lift exceeds approximately 0.01 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is lifted when the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> contacts the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at various points during the engine cycle. The exhaust valve lift <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> illustrates the distance the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is lifted from its seat while the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are in the engaged position.

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 18</cross-reference>, the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> approximately 0.21 inches at portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>during the exhaust stroke. Comparatively, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> approximately 0.04 inches at portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>during the expansion stroke. As mentioned above, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is normally used in cooperation with a compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to reduce the resistive torque during starting. Starting usually involves the operator pulling on a pull cord to rotate the engine through the engine cycle, but starting could also include an electric starter rotating the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/782,468 filed Feb. 9, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference. A mechanical vacuum release (&ldquo;MVR&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> refers to the entire mechanism that relieves the vacuum created in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during a non-combusting expansion stroke. The MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> comprises the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. A mechanical compression release (&ldquo;MCR&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> refers to the entire mechanism that relieves the pressure in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during a compression stroke. The MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> comprises the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke to relieve pressure in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by allowing air to exit the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is substantially airtight when the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are closed. Therefore, releasing air from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke creates a vacuum in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke. The primary reason the vacuum condition exists is because the pressure within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was released by the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift, or unseat, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke to relieve the vacuum in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by allowing air to enter the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by the exhaust valve lift <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 18</cross-reference>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably first contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at approximately 40 crank degrees. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could possibly begin to open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> between 0 and 90 crank degrees, and the preferred range for beginning to open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is between 30 and 70 crank degrees. The expansion stroke occurs between 0-180 crank degrees, but a large portion of the work from the expansion stroke is done between 0-120 crank degrees. Therefore, the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may lose too much power and may not properly accelerate if the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> begins to open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> too early. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably opened approximately 0.04 inches at about 100 crank degrees, as shown by portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, during the expansion stroke. The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> begins to close before the cam lobe <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is opened approximately 0.21 inches at about 255 crank degrees, as shown by portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> then returns to a closed position for the intake stroke at approximately 450 crank degrees. The compression release mechanism <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> first contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke at approximately 550 crank degrees. The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is opened approximately 0.04 inches at about 610 crank degrees, as shown by portion <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> then returns to a closed position at approximately 670 crank degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Once the compression stroke ends at 720 degrees, the expansion stroke begins again at 0 degrees. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, </cross-reference>720 degrees and 0 degrees refer to the same point, which may also be referred to as top-dead-center, since it represents the point where the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is at the end of its stroke near the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. At 720 or 0 degrees, or top-dead-center, the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> changes directions, and the compression stroke transitions into the expansion stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably opens, as shown by exhaust valve lift <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, at approximately 550 degrees, and closes at approximately 670 degrees. Also, the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> preferably opens at approximately 40 degrees, and begins to close near 135 degrees. The points where the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closes and MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens are more significant than where the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> opens and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> closes. In the illustrated embodiment, the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closes near 670 degrees, and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens near 40. Therefore, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is closed for approximately 90 crank degrees between the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is closed at top-dead-center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, if the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens too early, the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may lose too much power and may not properly accelerate. Similarly, the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may not be able to accelerate if the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closes too late. Even when the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are engaged, the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must retain and begin to compress some of the air/fuel mixture for combustion to accelerate the engine speed. Therefore, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> must remain substantially closed when the engine is at 720 degrees, or top-dead-center, so that the engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can eventually accelerate to normal operating speeds, which will disengage the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is closed for approximately 90 crank degrees, which includes 720 degrees, or top-dead-center. The exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> must be closed at 720 degrees, and the engine could possibly operate as long as the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closes far enough before 720 degrees, and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens far enough after 720 degrees to permit some combustion and work transfer to the crankshaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to occur. Preferably, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is closed for at least 40 crank degrees between the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, including 720 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> All of the degrees referred to above have been crank degrees representing crankshaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> rotation. As mentioned above, crank degrees goes up to 720 degrees because the crankshaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> completely rotates twice for every engine cycle. However, the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> only completely rotates once for every engine cycle, so cam degrees representing cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> rotation only goes up to 360 cam degrees. Cam degrees are generally one-half of the corresponding crank degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> and mentioned above, the maximum for the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is approximately 100 crank degrees, and the maximum for the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is approximately 610 crank degrees. The maximums are separated by approximately 210 crank degrees. Converted from crank degrees into cam degrees, the maximums are separated by approximately 105 cam degrees. The maximums may represent the centerlines of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the centerlines of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are spaced approximately 105 cam degrees apart in relation to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The specific degree of separation between the centerlines is not necessary, and the centerlines could be modified by either opening the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> earlier, or closing the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> later. As mentioned above, the point where the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> opens and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> closes is not as significant as where the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closes and MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opens. Therefore, since the separation of the centerlines may be easily modified by adjusting non-critical features, the separation between the centerlines could be increased above 105 cam degrees. Additionally, the centerlines of the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, cam surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be offset, and need not be aligned with one another. However, as mentioned above, the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> must close between the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> closing and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> opening, and the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably closed for 40 crank degrees, or 20 cam degrees. Therefore, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the compression release <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are preferably spaced far enough apart to allow the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to contact the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and to allow the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to close between the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> only contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to lift the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> while the members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are in the engaged position. As mentioned above, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) as the engine is started. As the engine speed increases and reaches normal operating speeds, the rotation speed of the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> about the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also increases. Once the engine speed reaches a predetermined kick-out speed, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is centrifugally forced away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, causing the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to pivot about the pivot pin <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and move into the disengaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). As the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pivots into the disengaged position, the engaging portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is moved away from the shoulder <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and out of contact from the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Once the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disengaged, the cam follower <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably contacts the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> throughout the entire rotation of the cam <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> operate normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) for engine starting speeds, and pivots to the disengaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) when the engine reaches normal operating speeds. The kick-out speed generally occurs during the transition between starting speeds and normal operating speeds. The purpose of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to reduce resistance during the starting event, and it is only desirable for the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be engaged during engine starting speeds. A person pulling on a pull cord to start an engine generally rotates the engine approximately 350-700 RPM, with the average usually being between approximately 500-600 RPM. The desired range for the kick-out speed for the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is approximately 200-600 RPM. The kick-out speed could be below 200 RPM, but the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would not work as effectively. Also, the kick-out speed could be above 600 RPM, but the engine begins to lose too much power if the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> remains engaged at too high of a speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Since the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is normally used in cooperation with the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> should preferably not remain engaged after the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has disengaged. The kick-out speed for the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably less than, or similar to the kick-out speed for the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is larger than the corresponding flyweight of the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The relatively large flyweight portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generally causes the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the illustrated embodiment to disengage at a lower speed than the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. If the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> were desired to disengage at approximately the same speed, then the shape of the members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> could also be approximately the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are intended to reduce the resistive engine torque, or resistive force, on the pull cord (&ldquo;pull force&rdquo;) during starting. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates the pull force in pounds in relation to crank degrees for an engine. A dual release line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> represents the pull force for an engine having both a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A single release line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> represents the pull force for an engine having only a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, but not a MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The single release line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides a comparative illustration of the additional pull force for an engine without a MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and therefore also illustrates the pull force reduced by the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The single release line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a peak near 90 degrees that is not present on the dual release line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and this peak near 90 degrees represents the pull force reduced by the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A shaded area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>under the single release line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> represents the energy reduction by using the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is only needed when a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is used, and the pull force reduced by the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is significantly larger than the pull force reduced by the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The pull force for an engine without a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> would be off the scale of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> represents the pressure in psi within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during the starting event for an engine having only a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. When the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are both closed, the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a substantially air-tight seal. The pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may fluctuate as the movement of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> increases or decreases the volume of the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, because the change of volume of the substantially sealed combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will also change the pressure within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For most of the engine cycle illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is near zero, which indicates that one of the engine valves <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are open and the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is vented. The pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> becomes slightly negative (meaning a vacuum) near 500 crank degrees as the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> moves away from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during the intake stroke to draw the air/fuel mixture into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through the open intake valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> begins closing the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at approximately 630 crank degrees, and the exhaust line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>begins decreasing. At this same time, the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is moving toward the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke to decrease the volume of the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The combination of the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> closing and the volume of the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> decreasing causes the pressure within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to increase, so the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> begins increasing near 630 crank degrees. As the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> increases, the pull force required to continue moving the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> toward the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> also increases, so the dual release line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> also begins increasing near 630 crank degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> continues increasing after the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> closes because the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> continues moving toward the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to decrease the volume of the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> after the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is resealed. Once the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> passes top-dead-center at 720 or 0 crank degrees, the pressure built-up within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> pushes the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> downward and actually creates a negative force on the pull cord, as shown by the dual release line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> which decreases below zero immediately after 0 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> represents the pressure for an engine having only a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In an engine having only a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> becomes negative (meaning a vacuum) as the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> continues moving away from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and toward the crankcase <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> because a portion of the air within the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was released through the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The volume of the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> continues to increase, but there is no new air available to fill this volume so a vacuum is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In an engine having both a MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> unseats the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke and air is drawn into the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to minimize the vacuum otherwise created by the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The exhaust line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>begins increasing near 40 crank degrees as the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> begins opening the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. A shaded area <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>above the pressure line <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> near 90 crank degrees represents the vacuum created by the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> reduces vacuum represented by the shaded area <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to near zero. Since the vacuum is reduced by the MVR <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the dual release line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> also remains near zero at approximately 90 crank degrees. As described above, the single release line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> increases near 90 crank degrees because additional pull force is needed to overcome the vacuum <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>created by the MCR <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrate the first embodiment of a release member incorporated into an engine utilizing a direct lever overhead valve system. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> illustrate a second embodiment of a release member that implements a centrifugally responsive vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in a different engine configuration. The second embodiment relieves a vacuum within the combustion chamber during the expansion stroke when the engine is rotating at cranking and starting speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, a cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> rotates with a cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and contacts a tappet-type cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> which controls an engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is disposed near the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and comprises a blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and a cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. A cam surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> on the beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> acts as the vacuum release member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Similar to the first embodiment, the second embodiment also has an engaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a disengaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> has a tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> that is disposed between the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> when the vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> has a base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and a cam lobe <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is a portion of the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> that extends a substantially uniform distance from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The cam lobe <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is a bulge that extends outward from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> beyond the base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is interconnected to the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and contacts the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> as the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> rotates. The cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> preferably opens the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> when the cam lobe <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is preferably an exhaust valve <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, but it could possibly be an intake valve. The engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is configured to be closed when the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> contacts the base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The cam lobe <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is preferably timed to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and open the exhaust valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the exhaust stroke of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> has a cam surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> that is disposed near the end of the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> adjacent the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is interconnected to a cam gear <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, and has a bracket <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> at the end of the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> opposite the cam surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. The cam gear <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> rotates the cam in timed relation to the engine crankshaft. When the vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the cam surface <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> extends beyond the base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and separates the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to open, or unseat, the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> preferably opens the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> less during the expansion stroke than the cam lobe <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> opens the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the exhaust stroke. The vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is preferably timed to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and open the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke of the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is substantially U-shaped, and has respective flyweight portions <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> near the two ends of the U-shape. The blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is pivotably coupled to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and may pivot between the engaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and the disengaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). As mentioned above, the vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is normally used in cooperation with a compression release member <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> to reduce the resistive torque during starting. In the second embodiment, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may also function as the compression release member <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, similar to the saddle or yoke-type compression release member disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,453,507, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A cam member <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> is disposed near the curved portion of the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and extends away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and beyond the base radius <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The cam member <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> may form a portion of the compression release member <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> and contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> to separate the cam follower <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> from the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The cam member <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> is preferably timed to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and open the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke when the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position. A return spring <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> may be used to bias the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> toward the engaged position, and the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> preferably remains in the engaged position when the engine is rotating at or below starting speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As the engine and cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> begin to rotate faster, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> also rotates faster, and the flyweight portions <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are centrifugally forced away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The centrifugal force on the flyweight portions <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> causes the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to pivot toward the disengaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> reaches the disengaged position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is no longer disposed between the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> valve spring <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> biases the engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> toward a closed position. The spring biased engine valve <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> applies a force on the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, which in turn applies a force on the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is preferably made from a hardened material, such as metal or a similar material that is relatively flexible yet resilient and durable. When the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is in the disengaged position, the tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is not disposed between the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and the cam shaft <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and the tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> does not support the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> against the force of the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> alone, without the tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, can not support the force of the valve spring <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The valve spring <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> and cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> deflect the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> so the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may contact the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Therefore, once the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> pivots to the disengaged position, the engine returns to a relatively normal engine cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may also function as the compression release member <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. In addition, the blocking member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> must pivot to the disengaged position before cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> may deflect to allow the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to contact the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the vacuum release mechanism <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment have similar kick-out speeds and disengage at approximately the same time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> illustrate the tab <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> pivoted away from the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, and the cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> deflected to permit the cam follower <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to contact the cam <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The cantilevered beam <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is interconnected to the cam gear <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> with the bracket <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. Conventional fastening devices, such as screws, bolts, nuts, or rivets, may be used to fasten the bracket to the cam gear <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The cam gear <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may be made from a plastic material that may be heat deformed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the bracket <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may be alternatively fastened to the cam gear using plastic nubs <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> that extend from the cam gear <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and may be melted to hold the bracket <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> in the proper position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> pre-melted nub <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is represented by a dashed line. The pre-melted nub <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is first placed through a hole <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> in the bracket <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The nub <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is exposed to a heat source that melts the nub <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> around the hole <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> to form a plastic integral rivet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> illustrate a third embodiment of a release member. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a centrifugally responsive vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and a compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are both interconnected to a single yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> that is disposed near a cam <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and a cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is pivotally coupled to a cam gear <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to pivot between an engaged position and a disengaged position. Two bosses <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> project from the cam gear <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and apertures extend into the bosses <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> extends through the bosses <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to retain the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to the cam gear <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the pin <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> does not pass through the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is substantially U-shaped, and has a tab portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and two flyweight portions <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. The tab portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is disposed near the curved portion of the U-shaped yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and the flyweight portions <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> are disposed near the two ends of the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is a tab that projects outward from the tab portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, in a direction opposite the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may also be a tab that extends outward from the tab portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> both contact a cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> when the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position at engine starting speeds. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to open an engine valve during the expansion stroke. In the illustrated embodiment, when the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> contacts the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, the tab portion <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> contacts the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> helps support the force exerted by the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The flyweight portions <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> have sufficient mass to function as a flyweight. Once the engine reaches normal engine operating speeds, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> is centrifugally forced away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, causing the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to pivot to the disengaged position. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position, and a broken line <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> illustrates the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in the disengaged position. Once the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> pivots to the disengaged position, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> no longer contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Since the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are both interconnected to the yoke <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> both have the same kick-out speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> are oriented in relation to the cam <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and open an exhaust valve during a specific stage of the engine cycle. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke, and the compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke. As described above, the exhaust valve closes between the compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, so the cam follower <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> contacts the cam <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> between the compression release member <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrate a fourth embodiment of a release member. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a centrifugally responsive vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and a compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are both integrated into a single yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is disposed near a cam <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> and a cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and curves around the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is pivotally coupled to a cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to pivot between an engaged position and a disengaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is substantially U-shaped, and has an open end <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> and a curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> disposed at opposite ends of the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is a rounded bulge that extends outward from the curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> and projects away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is also a rounded bulge that extends outward from the curved closed end of the U-shaped yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> both contact a cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> as the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> rotates and the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position at engine starting speeds. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> to open an engine valve during the expansion stroke. In the illustrated embodiment, when the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> contacts the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> contacts the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, which helps support the force exerted on the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> by the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Two legs <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> extend from the curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> toward the open end <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> of the U-shaped yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Two flyweight portions <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are disposed at the ends of the legs <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> near the open end <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, each leg <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> has a retaining portion between the closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> and the open end <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> extends through the retaining portion and retains the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the receiving portions are U-shaped recesses <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the receiving portions may be holes, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the recesses <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> are positioned between the pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> and the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> pivots about the pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> when pivoting between the engaged position and disengaged position. The pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the pivot axis of the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is also substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> is substantially C-shaped and has an elongated middle portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and two end portions <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> that extend at an angle to the middle portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>. The middle portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> extends through the recesses <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>, and the end portions <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> extend into apertures <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> in the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the apertures <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> extend in the axial direction of the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> to facilitate the manufacture of the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, which is generally made from a molding or casting process. Since the apertures <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> extend in the axial direction, the apertures <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may be formed with a single pull during the manufacturing of the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. If a hole would extend in a direction transverse to the axial direction of the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, an additional pull during the gear manufacturing process may be necessary to form the hole. Reducing the number of pulls during manufacturing simplifies manufacturing and reduces the cost of the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment may be retained to the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> with a substantially straight pin, similar to pin <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> described above with the third embodiment and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this alternative embodiment, the pin <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may extend through apertures in the bosses <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> that extend in a direction substantially transverse to the axial direction of the cam gear <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the design of the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> also simplifies manufacturing and reduces the cost of the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The U-shaped recesses <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> that engage the pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> may be bent and eliminate the need to form a hole in the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are relatively co-planar with curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>, and the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> contacts the edge of the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> is substantially planar, but may have a slightly curved profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may be formed with a stamping process which permits relatively accurate tolerances for the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> do not have to be bent or machine ground, which eliminates additional machining steps. Also, contact stress on the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is reduced because the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is not ground. Since the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> contacts the edge of the curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> and the curved closed end <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> is substantially planar, the force exerted by the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> is substantially supported by the pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may support a relatively large amount of force, and the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may not have to be hardened. Additionally, the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, pin <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> and cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> are relatively easy to assemble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The flyweight portions <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> have sufficient mass to function as a flyweight. Once the engine reaches normal engine operating speeds, the flyweight portion <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is centrifugally forced away from the cam shaft <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, causing the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to pivot to the disengaged position. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> is in the engaged position, and a broken line <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> illustrates the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> in the disengaged position. Once the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> pivots to the disengaged position, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> no longer contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> as the cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> rotates. Since the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are both interconnected to the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> both have the same kick-out speed. The cam gear <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> includes a stop <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> to prevent the yoke <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> from pivoting beyond the desired position of the disengaged position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> are oriented in relation to the cam <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to contact the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and open an exhaust valve during a specific stage of the engine cycle. The vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> during the expansion stroke, and the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> contacts the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> during the compression stroke. As described above, the exhaust valve closes between the compression stroke and the expansion stroke so the cam follower <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> contacts the cam <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> between the compression release member <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and the vacuum release member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the retainer includes a pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> that retains a yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> adjacent a cam gear <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> at least partially surrounds a cam shaft <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, and is movable between an engaged position, in which the yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is adjacent a cam lobe <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and a disengaged position, in which the yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> pivots away from the cam lobe <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> extends through receiving portions in the yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the receiving portions are substantially U-shaped recesses <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. The yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> may include a release member <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight>, such as a compression release member, a vacuum release member, or other similar release members. In the illustrated embodiment, the yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is similar to the yoke <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> does not pass through the cam shaft <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, and is substantially transverse and non-intersecting to the cam shaft <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is an elongated member that is retained by a mount <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> near each end of the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The mounts <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> are connected to the cam gear <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, and may be formed integral with the cam gear <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the each mount <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> includes two tabs <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> that extend in substantially the same direction as the axial direction of the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, and a stop <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight> that extends in a direction substantially transverse to the axial direction of the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The stops <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight> retain the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> in the axial direction, and the tabs <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> retain the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> in a lateral direction. The tabs <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> are preferably made from a bendable material, preferably metal. Once the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is positioned within the mounts <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>, the tabs <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> may be bent inwardly toward one another to clamp the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and retain the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> within the mounts <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of the cam gear <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> with the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> within the mount <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the yoke <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is in the disengaged position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> also illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pin <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> within the mounts <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight>.
