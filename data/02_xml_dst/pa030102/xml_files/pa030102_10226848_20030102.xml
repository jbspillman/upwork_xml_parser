<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to a connector assembly with multiple rows and columns of conductive elements, especially to a connector assembly having a plurality of inner circuit boards mounted therein to form needed conductive paths to connect with a daughtercard and a backplane assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most of backplane assemblies used in a computation or communication device have at least one primary circuit board with the basic specialized function which need to combine with other functional electronic extension cards/circuit boards so that the whole assembly they belong to can achieve diverse, improvable and massively repeated performance. Therefore, a plurality of interconnection devices like board-to-board electrical connectors used to connect the primary circuit board and other extension circuit boards/cards then are broadly adopted in the backplane assembly. Due to multiple rows and columns of conductive elements or contacts such an interconnection device may have, the perfect and cheap way for manufacturing, assembling and mounting the interconnection device is difficult to find out or achieve at present. Originally, the conventional backplane connector design uses a large insulative housing with a plurality of holes for the inserted installation of contacts. However, this kind of designs is not good and convenient enough for the high density and small-pitched requirement of an interconnection device recently. Specially, the complicated and necessary assembling process causes the high cost of the final product and time consuming. Therefore, it is known to provide each column of contacts as a separate module that includes one vertical array of contacts having an overmolded carrier. Multiple modules then are integrally installed in a connector housing to form a complete connector. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,066,236 and 5,664,968 both show such a connector structure. Generally, all of the modules in such a connector are substantially identical. But different types of modules sometimes are needed in a connector in order to accommodate different electrical characteristics of signals through the connector. Besides, due to continuing trends toward miniaturization and improved electrical performance by the electronics industry, requirements for greater conductive element/contact density and higher electrical speeds are constantly being promulgated. These requirements lead to design conflicts, especially when electrical speeds are in the range of approximately 500 megahertz and above, due to the fact that increasing the contact density places the conductive elements/contacts in closer proximity to each other, thereby leading to crosstalk between neighboring conductive elements/contacts in different signal pairs. Thus, as introduced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,341 and 6,299,484, some ground reference means are disposed between every two signal modules to reduce crosstalk induced therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, new overmolded technology developing recently shows possibly high production cost may be caused because more and more minimized conductive elements should be assembled together in a small-sized plastic block. It is much difficult to position these high density arranged conductive elements in a overmolding mold due to the high plastic injection pressure and scarce space between these elements. A precise and complicate mold that usually costs high is needed to achieve the production. Therefore, some other substitutes like a small circuit board are considered. Robin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,014 and Paagman U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,899 both show a plurality of inner circuit boards installed inside a backplane connector. Each conductive path on these circuit boards can be thinner and closer to each other than a separate stamping contact of the overmolded module though a perfect small circuit board costs high too. An extra solder tail or a mating contact for every conductive path on the circuit board is needed and most of them should be soldered onto one of the circuit boards first before the circuit board is installed into the backplane connector. And the solder joints of every circuit board may be hurt or broken when the backplane connector is mated because the mating force applied on every circuit board may be transferred to its solder joints right away. More fixing or positioning features have to be considered and adopted to overcome this situation and result in a higher product cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector used in a backplane application with inner circuit boards installed therein to achieve a better electrical performance by using a method of assembling and fastening the inner circuit boards and other parts of the connector along a direction vertical to its mating direction so that they can avoid any unnecessary displacement during the processes of mating or board-mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector having effective and useful fixing mechanism to fasten parts, like inner circuit boards, inside the connector, which still contributes easily assembling of parts and functions without any complicated structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical connector having larger tolerance to undesired mating displacement of inner circuit boards installed therein and maintaining better electrical performance in a vibration circumstance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To obtain the above objects, an electrical connector in accordance with the present invention includes a top housing and a bottom housing to form a receiving space therebetween. A plurality of parallel partitions extends respectively from the inner face of the top and bottom housing and protruding into the receiving space. Inner circuit boards with traces thereon are respectively inserted and stay in the space between every two partitions of either the top housing or the bottom housing. Besides, pairs of signal contacts and grounding plates are installed in the bottom housing. The signal contact pairs are respectively received inside every partition in one row and exposed their engaging arms out of one surface of the partition while each grounding plate is seated and abutting against the other surface of every partition respectively. Each of the inner circuit boards has pairs of signal traces on one surface and a grounding layer formed on the other so that they can be engaged with the signal contact pairs and grounding plates installed in the bottom housing when the connector is assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Specially, compressible ridges are disposed on the inner top face of the top housing between every two partitions in spaced-apart relationship. And holes are formed on the top housing and the bottom housing respectively and can be treated as a pair because each hole on the top housing and its related one on the bottom housing are located in the same plane right between two spaced-apart partitions. Two projections corresponding to the holes extend out of edges of every inner circuit board and are inserted into the holes when the connector is assembled. Meanwhile, a plurality of stops abutting against the inner bottom face of the bottom housing is stamped out of the surface of each grounding plate. Every one of the inner circuit board is rested on the top of the stops of a corresponding grounding plate and is pressed by the compressible ridges of the top housing in order to be positioned when the top and bottom housings are assembled as a whole connector along the direction parallel to the mating face of the connector. Therefore, the inner circuit boards can be held in position inside the connector though they are not actually fixed therein. The effective engagement between the boards and conductors in the bottom housing will be continuously maintained by projections of inner circuit boards and holes of the housings, and a flexible mechanism including ridges cooperating with stops of grounding plates when the connector is mated with its complementary connector. And due to the separable engagement between the inner circuit boards mostly received in the top housing and the conductors, pairs of signal contacts and grounding plates, received in the bottom housing and the fact of the top housing being removably latched above the bottom housing, the inner circuit boards can be dismantled and replaced anytime even though the connector is mounted on a printed circuit board and no special treatment or process like reflow is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the projections of every inner circuit board are inserted into the holes of the top and bottom housings respectively along a direction parallel to the mating face of the connector, which is the same direction as the assembling direction of the top and bottom housings, so that the top housing is latched on the bottom housing as well as all of the inner circuit boards are installed and fixed inside the connector at the same time. And projections of the inner circuit boards will stop any unnecessary movement of the inner boards along the mating direction when the connector is mated with its complementary connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present embodiment when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the electrical connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is shown mating with its complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The receptacle type electrical connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being assembled together to form a receiving space therebetween. The top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a top wall, a rear wall and two sidewalls extending from the edges of the top wall partially surrounding the receiving space. A plurality of partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed extending from the inner face of the top wall and protruding into the receiving space. These partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are parallel arranged and spaced from each other. Several compressible ridges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed on the inner face of the top wall between every two partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in spaced-apart relationship. Each of these ridges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can extend from one partition to the other perpendicular to surfaces of these two partitions or at a predetermined angle. A row of holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed on the top wall of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and each of these holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is disposed on the portion between every two parallel partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. And a pair of locking arms <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends from the lower edge of the rear wall and two sidewalls respectively. The bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a bottom wall, rear wall and two sidewalls corresponding to the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to enclose the receiving space together. Grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> each having a step disposed therein are formed on the outer surface of the rear wall and sidewalls of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corresponding to locking arms <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in order to lock the top and bottom housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together when each of the locking arm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> moves into one of the grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A plurality of partitions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are disposed extending from the inner face of the bottom wall of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and each partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is located basically in the same vertical plane as the one of its corresponding partition <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, two rows of recesses <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are disposed respectively on two surfaces of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and recesses <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> on one surface are formed deeper than others <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> on the other surface. A row of holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is disposed on the bottom wall of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corresponding to the holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and each of these holes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is located in the same vertical plane as its corresponding hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, two kinds of electrical conductors are received in the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. One kind of the conductors, pairs of signal contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, are installed in the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and resting in every partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in one row. Each signal contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a retention portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> used to fix the whole signal contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in its resting partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an engaging arm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> flexibly extending from the retention portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> upwards and having an contacting end disposed beyond one surface of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a tail portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> extending from the retention portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and extending out of the lower face of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to be compressively engaged with conductive traces of the daughter backplane circuit board (not shown). The other conductors, however, are grounding plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> seated on every partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> respectively. Each grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a plate-like base abutting against one surface of a partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a plurality of press-fit tails <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extending from the lower edge of the base. These tails <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and tail portions <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of signal contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are alternately arranged along the same line below every partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to avoid short circuit happening between these two kinds of conductors <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Every tail <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of grounding plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pressed fit in a corresponding hole on the daughter backplane circuit board when the receptacle connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted thereon. Thus, the whole connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be held in position on the daughter backplane circuit board by these press-fit tails <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and signal contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> gain enough normal compressing force to have their compressive tail portions <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> effectively engaged with pads connecting to traces on the daughter circuit board. Besides, several flexible beams <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extend from the top edge of every grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and are bent abutting against the other surface of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each flexible beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> exposes its end beyond the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> surface though most portions of the flexible beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are received in a corresponding recess <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> disposed thereon. On the base surface of each grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, lanced arms <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are punched out therefrom and located next to the shallower recesses <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> formed on the surface of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> where the base of the grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> abuts. The lanced arms <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> then gain enough space to move flexibly when they are engaged with any inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, a plurality of stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is stamped out of the base surface of each grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. These stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be shaped as a vertically extending tab partially seated on the inner face of the bottom wall of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a vertically risen shear-out protrusion with top and bottom sheared edges. Every one of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rested on the top of the flexible stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of a corresponding grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to be positioned vertically when these parts are assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference>, a plurality of inner circuit boards <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, used as main conductors in the connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are received in the receiving space with portions of them resting between every two partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> respectively. Every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has pairs of signal traces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on one surface and a grounding layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed on the other surface. Basically the signal trace pairs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are parallel arranged and spaced apart from each other on the board surface and a grounding layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed on the board surface either between two neighboring signal pairs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or partially surrounding one signal pair <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Each of signal traces of every pair <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at its both ends. The pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at one end of these signal traces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are aligned near a mating edge of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to be engaged with the conductors received in the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. And the pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at the other end of these signal traces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are aligned near another mating edge of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> used to mate with the complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. These mating-use pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> all have a cut-off area <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (shown one only by dash lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) near the mating edge of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in order to keep coincident impedance along the trace of a signal transmission path because the impedance of the transmission path varies when a pad <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is always wider than its connected trace <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a cut-off area of the grounding layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the other side of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> neighboring any one of the pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can affect the impedance of the signal transmission path by a similar coupling way in the substitutive method. And two rows of spaced trace ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connecting to the grounding layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed on the other board surface near either one mating edge of every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> respectively. Two projections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extend out of the top and bottom edges of every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and are inserted in the holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively in order to position the board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> along the mating direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is understandable, when the connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is going to be assembled, the conductors including signal contact pairs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and grounding plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are first installed therein. The signal contact pairs <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are installed in every partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and keep their engaging arms <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> partially exposed out of one surface of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. And each grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is installed abutting against the other surface of one partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and its flexible beams <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are hung down in the recesses <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> on the same exposing surface of the partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as signal contacts <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then inner circuit boards <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are respectively inserted into slots formed between every two partitions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and seated on stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the grounding plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> abutting against these boards <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the bottom of the slots. The engaging arm <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of every signal contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is then electrically engaged with the corresponding pad <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of every signal trace pair <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of one inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while the flexible beams <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> installed on the same partition <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as this contact <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are electrically engaged with grounding layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> surrounding the signal trace pairs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. And the lanced arms <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the same grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are electrically engaged with the trace ends <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the grounding layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a second inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> next to the previously mentioned one. Obviously, the distance between the engaging area of grounding layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the bottom edge of the inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is different from the distance between the signal pads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the same edge. Therefore, the insertion of each inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into its related slot of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is easier due to smaller needed insertion (or engaging) force. Finally, the subassembly of inner circuit boards <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is covered by the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> along the direction parallel to the mating face of the connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with locking arms <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sliding in the grooves <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and being locked therein to put the two housing parts <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> together. The upper portion of every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is received in the space between partitions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. And the whole circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is releasably kept in position by engaging with stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the grounding plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at its bottom and compressible ridges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at its top to be prevented from excess moving along the circuit board surface. Two projections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are movably received in hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the top and bottom housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to prevent the board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from backward moving when the connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mated with its complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Surely the installation of the boards <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is easy and convenient because the insertion direction of these projections <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is same as the assembling direction of the top housing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and every inner circuit board <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a header one for the backplane assembly connection mostly mounted on the primary backplane circuit board, has a housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a bottom wall and two shrouds <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> vertically extending from the opposing sides of the bottom wall. A plurality of partitions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the bottom wall and protrusively extending therefrom. These partitions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are parallel arranged and spaced apart from each other. Conductors, including grounding plates <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and signal contacts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, are installed onto/in partitions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the complementary connector housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Basically the structural feature or function of grounding plates <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and signal contacts <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mostly identical to those conductors in the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the receptacle connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. And the structural features of every partition <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> same as the features of the partitions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are adopted too. Therefore, the producing cost of the complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be reduced due to the duplicate parts of the receptacle connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. And most of the advantages mentioned above about the parts of the receptacle connector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be achieved by the complementary connector <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as well. </paragraph>
