<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a column packing filled in a device which is divided in a plurality of chambers or channels connected to one another and performs material transfer, heat exchange or mixing between gases, liquids or gas and liquid. The invention relates also to a method for manufacturing such column packing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. Hei 3-203976 discloses a column packing of this type. This column packing is made up of a plurality of permeable sheets which are disposed in parallel to one another and extend in the direction of a main stream of fluid. Projecting portions of these permeable sheets are disposed in the direction that crosses the main stream of fluid and these projections function as spacers between the adjacent permeable sheets. This packing (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;X-packing&rdquo; because the cross section of a joint portion between two adjacent permeable sheets assumes the shape of the letter X) is beneficial in that fluid flowing down along the permeable sheets is repeatedly joined, mixed, horizontally dispersed and redistributed at each joint of the permeable sheets. Thus, fluid flow which was not uniform when it was charged in the device gradually becomes uniform resulting in an optimum material transfer or heat exchange. Moreover, gas charged in the device passes through the liquid flowing along the inclined surfaces of the permeable sheets and necessary contact between the gas and the liquid is achieved by contacting the gas with the liquid while the gas passes through the permeable sheets, so that material transfer or heat exchange can be effected efficiently with a minimum pressure loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For manufacturing this X-packing, the inventor of this application proposed the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5, 673,726. According to this method, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, permeable sheets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in plural layers and joints <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of adjacent permeable sheets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are simultaneously produced and a three-dimensional woven packing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereby is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a case where this X-packing manufactured by the above described prior art method is used as a packing loaded in, e.g., a gas-liquid mixing device, the packing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is erected in the device and liquid from a distributor is caused to flow from the top to the bottom, i.e., in the direction of arrow A. It is, however, actually difficult to maintain the packing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> strictly horizontally in the device by reason of an error in installation or other causes and, as a result, the threads that run crosswise of the separated portions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the joints <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the packing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are disposed in a somewhat inclined relationship to the horizontal direction. For this reason, when the operation of the device is started and liquid is caused to flow in the direction of the arrow A, the liquid flows concentrically along a lower portion of the threads that run crosswise with the result that collection, horizontal distribution and downward redistribution of the liquid are not performed uniformly but flow of the liquid tends to concentrate on the lower portion of the inclined threads running corsswise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an X-packing capable of accurately achieving uniform collection and redistribution of liquid at joints of the X-packing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a method for manufacturing such X-packing at a low cost and in a large scale. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is also provided a method for manufacturing a packing made of a three-dimensional net-like structure which constitutes an internal structure of a device which performs material transfer, heat exchange or mixing between gases, liquids or gas and liquid, said internal structure being divided in a plurality of chambers or channels connected to one another and said three-dimensional net-like structure being made of a plurality of unit structures which are arranged continuously in vertical and horizontal directions of the three-dimensional net-like structure, each of the unit structures being formed by converging and dispersion of three line elements, said method comprising steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (A) forming a unit structure with three line elements, said unit structure consisting of a plurality of basic units each of which is a combination of two triangular pyramids having a common bottom surface and apexes disposed in opposite directions, said basic units being arranged continuously in vertical direction of the three-dimensional net-like structure with apexes of each of the basic units being in contact with apexes of adjacent basic units, and a converging section of the three line elements being formed by binding the three line elements at a point of contact of the apexes of the adjacent basic units, and </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing method of the invention, a packing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> consisting of a three-dimensional net-like structure as shown in the schematic perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be produced.

In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are bound by wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, no element corresponding to the horizontal threads in the prior art X-packing is used at all in this unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By disposing, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of these unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in such a manner that horizontally adjacent ones of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> come into contact with each other so that the adjacent one of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are in a position to form a converging section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at each apex <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the common bottom surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the two triangular pyramids constituting the basic unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and forming the converging section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by binding the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at each point of contact of the horizontally adjacent ones of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the packing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of a three-dimensional net-like structure is formed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> This embodiment relates to a method for manufacturing a three-dimensional net-like structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> in which the unit structure is formed by converging and dispersion of three line elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Line elements used in the manufacturing method of the invention may be made of metal or plastic. There is no particular limitation in the material used for line element and wire, twine or monofilament may be used as the line elements. Since the line element is formed to a three-dimensional net-like structure by alternately repeating opening and converging of the three line elements, the material for the line element must be capable of plastic deformation and have sufficient rigidity to maintain their shape after twisting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The line element may be made of a monofilament or a single piece of wire but a line element made of wire or twine which is made by twisting thin steel lines or plastic lines is preferable because liquid flows along the space between the lines which constitute the wire or twine due to the capillary action and thereby enhance transfer of the liquid. In the present embodiment, seven steel lines each having a diameter of 0.1 mm are twisted together to form a single steel wire and two of this steel wire are further twisted to a single wire and this wire is used as the line element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (1) Step of Producing a Unit Structure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For producing the unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the three-dimensional net-like structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are first disposed in parallel to one another and in contact with one another as shown in the front view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and the plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Then, for forming converging sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are bound together at a predetermined interval with wires <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as shown in the front view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and the plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For binding the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with the wires <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> made of steel wire is bent in U-shape in its foremost end portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by means of a known wire tip bending machine (not shown). Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, this wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is disposed in such a manner that its bent foremost end portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>enclose the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and are engaged with these line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the foremost end portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a portion of the wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> adjacent to the foremost end portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are held by cutting pliers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. By turning the cutting pliers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by predetermined times (e.g., three times), a knot (shown by reference numeral <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) is formed in the wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Then, the cutting pliers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are withdrawn by a predetermined distance and the wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and its foremost end portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are cut off with the cutting pliers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Then, the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which have been bound at converging sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed at the predetermined interval in the longitudinal direction are spread apart at each middle position between the adjacent converging sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A, 10B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, an opening spreader <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having three hooks <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are disposed at an interval of 180 degrees is disposed in such a manner that the respective hooks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>l<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are engaged with respective three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at middle positions between the respective converging sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, by pulling the hooks <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the direction of arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are spread apart at the middle positions of the converging sections <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. Thus, when the hooks <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have been withdrawn, the unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which consists of a plurality of basic units <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> each of which is a combination of two triangular pyramids having a common bottom surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and apexes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed in opposite directions, the basic units <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being arranged continuously in vertical direction, is formed. The converging section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of this unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is shown in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (2) Step of Binding a Plurality of the Unit Structures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A plurality of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are disposed in such a manner that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, horizontally adjacent ones of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> come into contact with each other so that the adjacent one of the unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are in a position to form the converging section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at each apex <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the common bottom surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the two triangular pyramids constituting the basic unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. By binding the converging section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at each point of contact of the adjacent ones of the unit structure <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in a manner shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, i.e., by binding with wire <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the packing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> made of a three-dimensional net-like structure is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the above described steps (1) and (2), forming of plural unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and binding of these unit structures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be achieved all at once by arranging and operating a plurality of cutting pliers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and opening spreader <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Another example of binding three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> together is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, flat steel wire <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the form of a flat sheet is bent in U-shape in its foremost end portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>. This flat steel wire <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is disposed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in such a manner that its bent foremost end portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>substantially encloses the three line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and is engaged with the line elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>.
