<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for automatically calculating and managing customer earned equity liaises several customers with merchants who wish to participate in a plan to reward a customer with earned equity credit, also termed ownership investment credit (OIC), from the merchant&apos;s stock holdings, based on a customer&apos;s completed purchase of a product or service. A merchant interface which is part of the inventive system, provides access for customers registered in the system to information, merchant brand, product/service categories, incentive program, and price, through descriptive pages which customers can browse. The merchant interface assists a customer to select a merchant, a product/service and to complete an order form. After receiving, verifying and recording the customer&apos;s purchase transaction, the merchant interface sends information to a registration and transactions database. From inputs received from the registration and transaction database and based on merchant equity credit calculation rules recorded in the system, a customer&apos;s earned equity credit is automatically calculated, stored in an equity credit database and further processed for redemption by the customer, based on redemption rules in the system and based on customer choice. A customer&apos;s earned equity credit information may be sent by the system to a stock broker to initiate purchase of stock for the customer. The equity credit calculation rules might include considerations such as customer&apos;s purchase volume, customer being a new customer, and payment by customer within terms. The merchants might be selling products or providing services, and could include, without limitation, those dealing in long distance telecommunications, credit card services, gasoline, cable/satellite TV service, Internet service, automobile leasing, mutual finds, bonds, stock funds, or entertainment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Incentives for patronage wherein customers/consumers are encouraged to buy more and more of whatever product/service a merchant has to offer are known in prior art. A well-known example is frequent flier miles completed up to a stage where if the accumulated miles reach a predetermined limit (e.g., 50,000 or 100,000 miles) the user is then entitled to a free flight within a defined distance radius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A second well-known example is the incentive provided by certain credit card companies to encourage use of the credit card by a customer, wherein the customer accumulates points based on the dollar value of the credit used. The points are redeemable for purchase of items from a predetermined list maintained by the credit card providers, or can be applied towards the cost of vacations, for example. Alternatively, the accumulated redeemable points can be converted into cash coupons which can be applied or used for future purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Yet another example is a well-known GM&reg; card, which provides its users with 5% earnings on purchases made using the card, with a $500/year cap on earnings. The accumulated card earnings are redeemable on the purchase or lease price of new GM&reg; cars and trucks. The parameters to be considered by the card provider in such an arrangement are simply that there is a cap or ceiling on the <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>% earned amounts for calendar year, and that the only way the accumulated card earnings can be used by a user is to purchase or lease a new GM&reg; vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Prior art includes examples whereby a user is rewarded for using certain services or making purchases on-line, or even for paying attention to an advertisement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The general concept of the present invention took shape in 1997 from research into customer acquisition and retention strategies being used by the telecommunications industry. These strategies usually employ some form of rebate or promotional &ldquo;currency&rdquo; as an incentive for new or continued patronage. Frequent flier miles, concert tickets, even checks for $100 were being distributed, often yielding disappointing acquisition results as well as poor retention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In September, 1997, the assignees of this invention commissioned a national survey, conducted by the Townsend Group, of 600 respondents interviewed by telephone. The sample was controlled for gender to ensure an even distribution of men and women. The results were deemed accurate by the survey group within a margin of error of &plusmn;4 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The survey, entitled &ldquo;Equity Investment Program as a Means to Attain and Secure Long Distance Telephone Subscribers&rdquo;, was presented on Oct. 6, 1997. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention resides in a system and method for calculating and administrating offering of equity grants and earned equity incentives to customers who consume products or services offered by a provider, based on several factors including the consumption of products and services by the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Prior art systems known hitherto where a customer is rewarded for a purchase, are relatively simple and do not need to take into consideration any account balance or payments by the user, nor the calculation of any customer equity grants and/or earned equity credits (equity grant/earned equity commerce). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Generally, offering a reward or some kind of an advantage or benefit to the buyer or consumer for the business transacted by the consumer, is a palatable idea for the consumer, and a marketing tool for the provider. Additionally, the idea that a consumer can own a piece of the business of a provider from whom the consumer buys a commodity or service is a highly attractive proposition for the majority of the consumers. It is recognized that the extent of interest which a consumer or buyer can own in a provider&apos;s business should, among other things, depend on the magnitude of purchase or the rate of consumption of the service consumed on an ongoing basis. This concept has led to the creation, by the inventors, of a unique promotional currency called Ownership Investment Credit (OIC), which enables consumers to build an equity stake in the provider&apos;s business. Examples of such providers are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Long distance telecommunications; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Credit card services; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Gasoline; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Cable/satellite television service; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Internet service; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Automobile leasing; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Entertainment; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Mutual funds, stock funds, and bonds; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> and many more The OIC incentive is doubly attractive to consumers since it offers growing equity ownership in major corporations for expenditures that are already committed in every household budget. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The OIC incentive is much more powerful than traditional forms of customer incentive such as rebates, discounts, and frequent flier miles. Rebates require customer action (usually delayed) for redemption. Discounts are often assumed by the customer to represent the true price of the good or service. It is said that frequent flier miles, now more than 20 years old, are over-offered and under-used. They are also subject to increasing restrictions on their redemption. None of these, or other forms of buyer incentive or loyalty programs have the attraction of ownership. The value of the OIC will be instantly perceived by the consumer. Building an equity stake in a number of major corporations offers a pathway in the direction of financial security, the most powerful incentive of all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to a system wherein the OIC can be used by the consumer to obtain equity grant and earned equity credit. The present invention provides a processing system, and method of data processing for causing consumer equity granting and consumer earned equity interest in patronage commerce. By this invention, an offering company grants a slice of its equity and stock to the consumer in correlation to the individuals consumer&apos;s patronage as measured by the consumer&apos;s consumption of products, services, and promotional alliance offerings of the offering company. A consumer can earn OICs, for example, as a percentage of the consumer&apos;s purchase. Based on the earned OICs, shares in the offering company&apos;s stock can be purchased by a brokerage house and held in the consumer&apos;s account, as directed by the assignee company, for example. Several considerations such as consumer&apos;s transaction data and customer&apos;s response to company&apos;s promotion type offerings can additionally be taken into account as parameters while figuring out the equity credit which a consumer will be earning from time to time. The use of the method, data processing system, and apparatus of the present invention has application in the offering of consumer services and products such as consumer utilities services, gas and electric, consumer communications services, such as telephone services, cable services, and Internet services, and the offering of consumer products, both durable and non-durable goods, as well as the ability to make available the offering company&apos;s equity credits to other companies to use in the promotion and sale of their goods and services under promotional alliance agreements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The assignee, through a website, might offer a variety of unique services, special offers that include bonus OICs, examples of equity-building potential for typical merchant goods and services, and an incentive OIC calculator, which shows the value of the consumer&apos;s personal OIC portfolio based on the previous day&apos;s closing stock prices. In addition, consumers might use the website as an Internet gateway since it will also include such Internet functionalities as e-mail, access to search engines, personal productivity tools, news, and other valuable content. The assignee website will be a powerful marketing and advertising medium for the participating merchant companies. It will also be a source of valuable consumer data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Consumers can become members of the system operated by the assignee through the website and/or mail or call center by filling out a registration form and selecting the merchant company programs in which they wish to participate. New merchant companies will be added on a regular basis. Merchant companies may also solicit members through their own websites and promotional material. Merchants and providers, by associating with an assignee or license could derive a variety of benefits including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Increased market share; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Customer retention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Creation of new shareholders; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Enhancement of equity value; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Source of customer purchase and demographic data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Merchant companies and other providers can benefit directly by the addition of new customers seeking the equity grant and earned equity credit commerce and by the conversion of existing to customer/owners to ensure competitive preference and customer retention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This invention generally provides a liaison system and method for calculating and managing customer earned equity in the seller&apos;s ownership equity, based on the customer&apos;s purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> More particularly, in electronic commerce or in an Internet setting where a customer can buy a product or a service from a selected merchant on-line, the invention provides a liaising system between the customer and the merchant provider for automatically calculating, managing, and selectively administrating customer earned equity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In its broad form, the invention resides in a method, and a system for automatically calculating customer earned equity stock in a merchant&apos;s/provider&apos;s ownership equity based on purchases made by the customer with the merchant/provider, comprising a merchant interface which receives, verifies, and records a customer&apos;s access/registration information and transaction fulfillment information, means for generating signals indicating completion of a purchase transaction and payment therefor; means storing merchant&apos;s/provider&apos;s equity credit calculation and equity conversion and redemption rules; and a processor coupled to a software program which responsive to said signals and said equity conversion and redemption rules generates calculated equity credit information which indicates equity stock earned by the customer for purchase made through the purchase transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention, in another form, resides in a system and method for liaising a plurality of customers with a plurality of merchants/providers, with the object of automatically calculating and managing customer earned equity based on customer&apos;s purchases from a provider. In electronic commerce where customers on line can select a merchant and an offered product/service/promotional deal for purchase, and wherein a selected merchant wishes to participate in a plan to reward a customer with earned equity credit from the selected merchant&apos;s stock holdings, said earned equity stock being commensurate with customer&apos;s purchase, the invention provides a method for liaising a plurality of customers as potential purchasers with a plurality of merchants who wish to participate in and be part of the system, for automatically calculating and managing customer earned equity, said method comprising the steps of: enabling said plurality of customers and said plurality of merchants to participate in the system; offering access to any of said plurality of customers to participating merchants&apos; information including available products, services, promotional deals and their corresponding prices; storing merchants&apos; equity credit calculation rules and equity redemption rules; and using a processor including a software program for automatically generating calculated earned credit equity information for a single customer, based on said credit calculation rules and equity redemption rules as well as said single customer&apos;s completed purchase information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a modification of the system, the merchant interface includes means to allow a customer to obtain information pertaining to several merchants by browsing merchant data and merchant&apos;s product/service data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order for the system and method of the invention to serve to liaise a customer with a merchant/provider, it is preferable that both the customer and the merchant are affiliated with the system provider. If not already affiliated, the customer can become affiliated with the system provider. Likewise, the merchant can become affiliated too.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates diagrammatically a system and a process overview of an embodiment of the invention showing earned equity incentive driven commerce. The illustrated system is intended as a bridge between users/customers on the one hand, and merchants/providers on the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For a new customer <highlight><bold>010</bold></highlight>, the incentive process/system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> provides for registration at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is transmitted as information to both the registration/transactions database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and into a unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which interfaces with merchant&apos;s customer registration and transaction fulfillment unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which may be outside of the system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Parallely, unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> handles and screens access to the system from those who are already customers. Information entered by customers is likewise transmitted to units <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for processing, and to database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> for storage. The purchase and delivery aspects of a transaction from a new customer or an existing customer are handled at the unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which is controlled by the concerned merchant. Notwithstanding, information to the effect that a purchase has been made and the payment therefor authorized, is transmitted back from unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Database <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> receives inputs from unit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and also stores information relating to the merchant&apos;s products and services. Output information from both the databases <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is made available to unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> which has a program to make automated equity credit calculation and generate earned equity credit information. It is also possible to obtain reports from databases <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> to obtain any required information or details regarding customers and/or merchant services and products. The program within unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> takes into account all the parameters which the provider of system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> intends to be considered before making a calculation of equity credit or automated equity credit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Examples of parameters (for any customer) which might be considered by unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> include product sales, service usage, acquired promotional equity credits, account balance, and payments and other data elements. Unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> also holds calculation capabilities necessary to process consumer equity grants, the allocation and award of earned equity credits, the conversion of equity credits and transfer of offering company equity to the consumer customer. Unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> generates updated equity credit information which is stored in database at <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. From database <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, a feedback line is capable of transferring information to either an existing customer or a newly registered customer, as the case may be. Unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> also generates an output received by unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> to prepare suitable equity credit information to equity conversion documents which may be in the form of a hard copy voucher, or a record in an electronic form which is conveyed to a customer and the merchant/provider, as well as a securities broker/dealer as shown at <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a functional layout of a new customer/owner registration module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A customer who is a potential owner of equity interest in a merchant firm obtains telephone and/or Internet access to a call center and/or welcome page <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> respectively. The customer is led to the customer/owner registration page where the customer provides the registration information. A customer identification number or code is assigned at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to a new customer. The customer identification is sent to a customer registration and transactions database <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a customer/owner access unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which includes a login page <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, portal page <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a call center interface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> provides a view of account data. <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> houses company information pages. Unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> lets the customer view the earned equity credits, and if the customer desires to redeem the credits, information is sent to the equity credit database <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a merchant interface <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which shows the access to a customer for merchant and product information/data as shown at <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a customer gets to select a merchant and a product to be purchased as shown at <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> respectively. From block <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, an order form <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is completed and a credit verification is done as shown at <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, signals are sent to enable the merchant&apos;s customer registration and transaction fulfillment as shown at <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, the merchant&apos;s customer registration and transactions fulfillment information is received, verified and recorded. Database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> holds in memory all information regarding customers&apos; registrations and transactions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also shows a customer/owner calling via telephone direct to merchant and then being included in data transfer system from merchant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows at <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, an equity credit calculation process using the invention, which may use a CPU, RAM, ROM, clock, network card, and I/O interface as needed, as well as a software program which by using an interactive setup of equity calculation rules, computes the customer equity credit for each purchase made from a merchant/provider wherein the merchant/provider has agreed to allot earned equity stock to a customer based on purchases made by the customer. Information so generated is updated and is held in memory in the database <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates at unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> the equity credit redemption process using the invention. Unit <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> incorporates software and other elements such as a CPU, RAM, ROM, network card, and a clock. It includes an interactive setup of equity credit redemption rules as shown at <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> is an equity redemption rules database. The equity credit redemption calculation is performed at <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, as well as the preparation of equity credit redemption vehicles as well as notification to merchant and brokerage house and customer/owner (e.g., voucher or an electronic document). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Process Narrative of an Exemplary Embodiment of the Inventive System: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The process begins with a new customer <highlight><bold>010</bold></highlight> entering the system via one of numerous methods. First, a new customer <highlight><bold>010</bold></highlight> may reach via telephone (A) our call center, via an Internet connection or through a merchant&apos;s call center, mail or Internet presence <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> a page where a user may enter customer information including name, address, contact information, social security number and user preferences resulting in a unique identification code and password being issued <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A potential customer may also enter the system via an Internet connection and browser such as Netscape navigator or Internet explorer (A) and arrive at the Welcome page <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The user will have the option to browse pages for further company information and advantages, required Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosures and equity accumulation illustrations <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, or proceed directly to the registration page <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. From all pages a link is provided to the registration page where vital information can be entered into a secure environment, submitted and a unique user identification (ID) and password will be assigned at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Access to this routine will also be provided via member merchant&apos;s web sites, mail processing center and customer service departments. In all instances, the customer/owner&apos;s information, ID and password will be stored in the Customer Registration and transaction Database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> (In all Internet routines it is assumed user will have the ability to backtrack from any particular point in the program. Also user will have the ability to return to the selection menu as well as have the ability to exit program at any time during all further steps even though this is not constantly repeated. It is also common that a customer service and call center will have the ability to interact and access all data and routines.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The user will then have the option to proceed directly to the merchant interface or proceed as other existing registered customer owners would, via a login page <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which will be an optional security feature to restrict access to personal portal page <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Elements of the portal page will include links to company pages <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, View and manage stored earned equity credits <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, trigger the redemption of qualified credits <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, view and manipulate account registration information and preferences, and links related to the merchant interface in addition to stock portfolio functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The merchant interface section of the portal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> will display choices by merchant brand and product information categories. From this point the user can use the browse option to either view stored product data and program description pages <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, or follow links directly to the individual merchant&apos;s web sites for more detailed information on the merchant or programs/services offered. The browse option will allow the user the ability to display the products and services in a variety of ways; for example, they may want to view merchants alphabetically or they may opt to view products by assigned criteria via a &ldquo;boolean&rdquo; search string to enable easier product or service comparison. Each particular merchant may have numerous product offerings and levels of services and incentive programs which will result in numerous pages to view and scroll through depending upon the amount of information the customer requires for making a decision. If the user decides to purchase a product or service, a merchant is selected at <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, then a product is selected at <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. From this point merchant fulfillment may be handled in one of many ways. The customer owner may be an existing customer of a merchant, resulting only in the need to identify himself by their unique ID number, to the merchant resulting in being included in the merchant&apos;s routine data transfer to the inventive system. Alternatively, a link may be provided to the merchant and the order can be placed electronically directly to the merchant, again resulting in a data transfer from the merchant to the inventive system database. Or, the customer may utilize an electronic order from within the system <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Upon filling out this order form, if open terms are not offered, a credit card will be required and an electronic credit card verification routine <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> will be conducted; the credit card will be authorized and if positive, as with merchants offering open terms, a purchase order will be generated and transmitted to the merchant and any transaction information will be stored in the customer transactions database or, a customer may print an order form from merchants&apos; pages and either submit via mail or facsimile the order directly to the merchant. In all instances including those where product orders or subscription of services are handled directly by the merchants, data on the commerce activity will be transferred from the merchants to the inventive system either by an electronic data or media transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> All merchant and transaction data received by system <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> will undergo such processes as receipt confirmation, verification, matching and sorting of registration and fulfillment data. Upon completion of data processing operations, this transaction data is then stored in the customer/owner registration and transactions database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The customer may at this point either exit the system or return to personal portal to utilize other features, or begin a selection routine of another product or service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As the transaction data is reported to database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the inventive system, batches of data undergo the equity credit calculation process <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. The program calls the specific equity credit calculation rules <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> unique to that merchant&apos;s services or products transactions and the calculation is performed resulting in equity credits in the equity credit database <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. For example, purchase activity with merchant A may have been $100 for user JQ<highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, and this sales volume will be calculated to result in X number of credits being issued based upon pre-defined merchant criteria and parameters. Some exemplary merchant criteria would include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Sales Volume X a fixed percentage&equals;X Equity Credits </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> New customer&equals;Award X additional Credits and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Sales volume&gt;X&equals;XX in credits and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Sales volume&gt;Y&equals;YY in credits and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Sales volume&gt;Z&equals;ZZ in credits . . . and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> P credits if paid within terms, R if not and/or More . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As the equity credits are calculated at <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, and recorded, batch data will be matched to additional criteria <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to determine credit redemption eligibility and to assign a status to those credits. These additional criteria for example may relate to (a) certain purchase or commerce volume (b) length of time a customer has been active with that merchant (c) that a certain number of credits be accrued since last redemption of credits, or (d) credits may become available immediately. If result is automatic redemption or if customer has activated a redemption routine, again, additional merchant data is queried, a redemption vehicle is prepared and delivered as a notification to the customer. Results again are stored in the equity credit database <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and/or the customer/owner registration and transactions database <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
