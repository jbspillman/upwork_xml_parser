<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An isolation system is provided that is suitable for use in telephony, medical instrumentation, industrial process control and other applications. Preferred embodiments of the invention comprise a capacitive isolation barrier across which a digital signal is communicated. The system provides a means of communication across the isolation barrier that is highly immune to amplitude and phase noise interference. Clock recovery circuitry may be employed on one side of the isolation barrier to extract timing information from the digital signal communicated across the barrier, and to filter the effects of phase noise introduced at the barrier. Delta-sigma converters may be disposed on both sides of the isolation barrier to convert signals between analog and digital domains. An isolated power supply may also be provided on the isolated side of the barrier, whereby direct current is generated in response to the digital data received across the isolation barrier. Finally, a bidirectional isolation system is provided whereby bidirectional communication of digital signals is accomplished using a single pair of isolation capacitors. In preferred embodiments, the digital data communicated across the barrier consists of digital delta-sigma data signals multiplexed in time with other digital control, signaling and framing information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of isolation systems for use in selectively isolating electrical circuits from one another. More particularly, this invention relates to isolation systems having capacitor-coupled isolation barriers and to direct digital access arrangement circuitry for connecting to phone lines. This invention is useful in, for example, telephony, medical electronics and industrial process control applications. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electrical isolation barriers can be identified in many industrial, medical and communication applications where it is necessary to electrically isolate one section of electronic circuitry from another electronic section. In this context isolation exists between two sections of electronic circuitry if a large magnitude voltage source, typically on the order of one thousand volts or more, connected between any two circuit nodes separated by the barrier causes less than a minimal amount of current flow. typically on the order of ten milliamperes or less. through the voltage source. A electrical isolation barrier must exist, for example. in communication circuitry which connects directly to the standard two-wire public switched telephone network and that is powered through a standard residential wall outlet. Specifically, in order to achieve regulatory compliance with Federal Communications Commission Part 68. which governs electrical connections to the telephone network in order to prevent network harm, an isolation barrier capable of withstanding 1000 volts rms at 60 Hz with no more than 10 milliamps current flow, must exist between circuitry directly connected to the two wire telephone network and circuitry directly connected to the residential wall outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In many applications there exists an analog or continuous time varying, signal on one side of the isolation barrier, and the information contained in that signal must be communicated across the isolation barrier. For example, common telephone network modulator/demodulator, or modem. circuitry powered by a residential wall outlet must typically transfer an analog signal with bandwidth of approximately 4 kilohertz across an isolation barrier for transmission over the two-wire, public switched telephone network. The isolation method and associated circuitry must provide this communication reliably and inexpensively. In this context, the transfer of information across the isolation barrier is considered reliable only if all of the following conditions apply: the isolating elements themselves do not significantly distort the signal information, the communication is substantially insensitive to or undisturbed by voltage signals and impedances that exist between the isolated circuitry sections and, finally, the communication is substantially insensitive to or undisturbed by noise sources in physical proximity to the isolating elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> High voltage isolation barriers are commonly implemented by using magnetic fields, electric fields, or light. The corresponding signal communication elements are transformers, capacitors and opto-isolators. Transformers can provide high voltage isolation between primary and secondary windings, and also provide a high degree of rejection of lower voltage signals that exist across the barrier, since these signals appear as common mode in transformer isolated circuit applications. For these reasons, transformers have been commonly used to interface modem circuitry to the standard, two-wire telephone network. In modem circuitry, the signal transferred across the barrier is typically analog in nature, and signal communication across the barrier is supported in both directions by a single transformer. However, analog signal communication through a transformer is subject to low frequency bandwidth limitations, as well as distortion caused by core non-lineanties. Further disadvantages of transformers are their size, weight and cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The distortion performance of transformer coupling can be improved while reducing the size and weight concerns by using smaller pulse transformers to transfer a digitally encoded version of the analog information signal across the isolation barrier, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,369,666. &ldquo;MODEM WITH DIGITAL ISOLATION&rdquo; (incorporated herein by reference). However, two separate pulse transformers are disclosed for bidirectional communication with this technique. resulting in a cost disadvantage. Another disadvantage of transformer coupling is that additional isolation elements, such as relays and opto-isolators, are typically required to transfer control signal information. such as phone ID line hook-stitch control and ring detect. across the isolation barrier, further increasing the cost and size of transformer-based isolation solutions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because of their lower cost. high voltage capacitors have also been commonly used for signal transfer in isolation system circuitry. Typically, the baseband or low frequency analog signal to be communicated across the isolation barrier is modulated to a higher frequency, where the capacitive isolation elements are more conductive. The receiving circuitry on the other side of the barrier demodulates the signal to recover the lower bandwidth signal of interest. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,895, &ldquo;TELEPHONE ISOLATION DEVICE&rdquo; (incorporated herein by reference) discloses a switching modulation scheme applied directly to the analog information signal for transmission across a capacitive isolation barrier. Similar switching circuitry on the receiving end of the barrier demodulates the signal to recover the analog information. The disadvantage of this technique is that the analog communication, although differential, is not robust. Mismatches in the differential components allow noise signals, which can capacitively couple into the isolation barrier, to easily corrupt both the amplitude and timing (or phase) of the analog modulated signal, resulting in unreliable communication across the barrier. Even with perfectly matched components, noise signals can couple preferentially into one side of the differential communication channel. This scheme also requires separate isolation components for control signals, such as hook-switch control and ring detect, which increase the cost and complexity of the solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The amplitude corruption concern can be eliminated by other modulation schemes, such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,292,595, &ldquo;CAPACITANCE COUPLED ISOLATION AMPLIFIER AND METHOD,&rdquo; which discloses a pulse width modulation scheme; U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,486 &ldquo;ISOLATION AMPLIFIER WITH PRECISE TIMING OF SIGNALS COUPLED ACROSS ISOLATION BARRIER,&rdquo; which discloses a voltage-to-frequency modulation scheme; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,339 &ldquo;ISOLATION AMPLIFIER INCLUDING PRECISION VOLTAGE-TO-DUTY CYCLE CONVERTER AND LOW RIPPLE, HIGH BANDWIDTH CHARGE BALANCE DEMODULATOR,&rdquo; which discloses a voltage-to-duty cycle modulation scheme. (All of the above-referenced patents are incorporated herein by reference.) In these modulation schemes, the amplitude of the modulated signal carries no information and corruption of its value by noise does not interfere with accurate reception. Instead. the signal information to be communicated across the isolation barrier is encoded into voltage transitions that occur at precise moments in time. Because of this required timing precision. these modulation schemes remain analog in nature Furthermore, since capacitively coupled noise can cause timing (or phase) errors of voltage transitions in addition to amplitude errors. these modulation schemes remain sensitive to noise interference at the isolation barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another method for communicating an analog information signal across an isolation barrier is described in the Silicon Systems.

Nos. 5,500.894 for &ldquo;TELEPHONE LINE INTERFACE WITH AC AND DC TRANSCONDUCTANCE LOOPS&rdquo; and 5,602,912 for &ldquo;TELEPHONE HYBRID CIRCUIT&rdquo; both of which are incorporated herein by reference.) In this modem chipset, an analog signal with information to be communicated across an isolation barrier is converted to a digital format, with the amplitude of the digital signal restricted to standard digital logic levels. The digital signal is transmitted across the barrier by means of two, separate high voltage isolation capacitors. One capacitor is used to transfer the digital signal logic levels, while a separate capacitor is used to transmit a clock or timing synchronization signal across the barrier. The clock signal is used on the receiving side of the barrier as a timebase for analog signal recovery, and therefore requires a timing precision similar to that required by the analog modulation schemes. Consequently one disadvantage of this approach is that noise capacitively coupled at the isolation barrier can cause clock signal timing errors known as jitter, which corrupts the recovered analog signal and results in unreliable communication across the isolation barrier. Reliable signal communication is further compromised by the sensitivity of the single ended signal transfer to voltages that exist between the isolated circuit sections. Further disadvantages of the method described in this data sheet are the extra costs and board space associated with other required isolating elements, including a separate high voltage isolation capacitor for the clock signal, another separate isolation capacitor for bidirectional communication, and opto-isolators and relays for communicating control information across the isolation barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Opto-isolators are also commonly used for transferring information across a high voltage isolation barrier. Signal information is typically quantified to two levels. corresponding to an &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; state for the light emitting diode (LED) inside the opto-isolator. U.S. Pat. No. 5,287,107 &ldquo;OPTICAL ISOLATION AMPLIFIER WITH SIGMA-DELTA MODULATION&rdquo; (incorporated herein by reference) discloses a delta-sigma modulation scheme for two-level quantization of a baseband or low frequency signal, and subsequent communication across an isolation barrier through opto-isolators. Decoder and analog filtering circuits recover the baseband signal on the receiving side of the isolation barrier As described, the modulation scheme encodes the signal information into on/off transitions of the LED at precise moments in time, thereby becoming susceptible to the same jitter (transition timing) sensitivity as the capacitive isolation amplifier modulation schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another example of signal transmission across an optical isolation barrier is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,275 &ldquo;ANALOG DATA ACQUISITION APPARATUS AND METHOD PROVIDED WITH ELECTRO-OPTICAL ISOLATION. (incorporated herein by reference). In this disclosure, an analog-to-digital converter, or ADC, is used to convert several. multiplexed analog channels into digltal format for transmission to a digital system. Opto-isolators are used to isolate the ADC from electrical noise generated in the digital system. Serial data transmission across the isolation barrier is synchronized by a clock signal that is passed through a separate opto-isolator The A-DC timebase or clock, however, is either generated on the analog side of the barrier or triggered by a software event on the digital side of the barrier. In either case, no mechanism is provided for jitter insensitive communication of the ADC clock, which is required for reliable signal reconstruction, across the isolation barrier. Some further disadvantages of optical isolation are that opto-isolators are typically more expensive than high voltage isolation capacitors. and they are unidirectional in nature, thereby requiring a plurality of opto-isolators to implement bidirectional communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists an unmet need for a reliable, accurate and inexpensive apparatus for effecting bidirectional communication of both analog signal information and control information across a high voltage isolation barrier, while avoiding the shortcomings of the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above-referenced deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by the present invention, which provides a reliable, inexpensive, lightweight isolation system that is substantially immune to noise that affects the timing and/or amplitude of the signal that is transmitted across the isolating element. thus permitting an input signal to be accurately reproduced at the output of the isolation system. </paragraph>

Briefly described. the invention provides a means for transmitting and receiving a signal across a capacitive isolation barrier. The signal is digitized and quantized to standard logic levels for transmission through the barrier, and is therefore largely immune to amplitude noise interference. In one embodiment of the invention, the digital signal is synchronous and the signal is re-timed or latched on the receiving side of the isolation barrier using a clock signal that is recovered from the digital data sent across the barrier. The clock recovery circuit provides a means for filtering jitter on the received digital data so that the clock recovered has substantially less jitter than the received digital signal. Consequently, the digital communication across the capacitive isolation barrier is also largely immune to timing or phase noise interference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a context for understanding this description, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a typical application for the present invention: a telephone that includes circuitry powered by a source external to the phone system. A basic telephone circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is powered by the &ldquo;battery&rdquo; voltage that is provided by the public telephone system and does not have a separate power connection. Many modern phones <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, however, include radio (cordless), speakerphone, or answering machine features that require an external source of power <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, typically obtained by plugging the phone (or a power supply transformer/rectifier) into a typical 110-volt residential wall outlet. In order to protect public phone system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (and to comply with governmental regulations). it is necessary to isolate &ldquo;powered circuitry&rdquo; <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that is externally powered from &ldquo;isolated circuitry&rdquo; <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is connected to the phone lines, to prevent dangerous or destructive voltage or current levels from entering the phone system. (Similar considerations exist in many other applications as well. including communication, medical and instrumentation applications in which this invention may be beneficially applied.) The required isolation is provided by isolation barrier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The signal that passes through the isolation barrier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is an analog voice signal in a typical telephone application, but it may also be a digital signal or a multiplexed signal with both analog and digital components in various applications. In some applications, communication across isolation barrier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be unidirectional (in either direction), but in many applications, including telephony. bidirectional communication is required. Bidirectional communication may be provided using a pair of unidirectional isolator channels, or by forming a single isolation channel and multiplexing bidirectional signals through the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The primary requirements placed on isolation barrier <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are that it effectively prevents harmful levels of electrical power from passing across it, while accurately passing the desired signal from the powered side <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the isolated side <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, or in the reverse direction if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a basic block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. First the overall operation of the invention will be described. and then each component will be described in detail to the extent required to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. As a matter of terminology, the circuitry shown on the left or powered side of the isolation barrier (capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) will be referred to as the &ldquo;powered&rdquo; circuitry or the &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; circuitry or system, and the circuitry on the right side of the isolation barrier will be referred to as the &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; or &ldquo;receive&rdquo; circuitry or system. The &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; side can ordinarily be identified by the location of the dominant master oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on that side of the barrier, and the slave oscillator (e.g. clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>) is located on the receive side. Note, however, that in some embodiments of the present invention signals may be transmitted from the receive system to the transmit system, so these terms do not necessarily indicate the direction of data flow across the barrier. Furthermore, in some embodiments the master oscillator may be on the low-power (e.g. telephone system) side of the barrier, and a clock recovery PLL may be located on the high-power side of the barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> preferred unidirectional capacitive isolation system according to the present invention includes a delta-sigma analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> operable on the analog input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and driven by a clock signal from oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The digital output of the delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is synchronous with the operating frequency of oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and time division multiplexed with digital control signals <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> by encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> also formats the resulting digital data stream <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> into a coding scheme or framing format that allows for robust clock recovery on the receiving side of the isolation barrier. The isolation barrier comprises two high voltage capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the present invention. driver circuit <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> drives the transmit side of capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> with a digital voltage signal. Clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> presents a very high impedance to the receive side of capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. allowing the digital voltage output of driver <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to couple across the isolation barrier. In this embodiment. capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provides a return current path across the barrier In another embodiment, capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are differentially driven by complementary digital outputs of driver circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> In that embodiment. clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> presents a very high impedance to the receive sides of capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. allowing the differential digital voltage outputs of driver <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to couple across the isolation barrier The input to driver circuit <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is the output <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of encoder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The receive side of the isolation barrier includes clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. with inputs connected to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The clock recovery circuit recovers a clock signal from the digital data driven across the isolation barrier. The recovered clock provides clocking signals for decoder <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and delta-sigma digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Decoder circuit <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> separates the time division multiplexed data signal from control signals, providing a digital control output <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and data output <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that is routed to delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, with digital input supplied from decoder <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and clock supplied from clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, provides the analog output of the receive side of the isolation system, which closely corresponds to the original analog input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Active diode bridge circuit <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> may also be connected to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to provide a DC voltage source <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and decoder circuit <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> derived from energy contained in the signal transmitted across the isolation barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the descriptions of preferred embodiments that follow, all circuit references are made with respect to MOS (metal oxide-semiconductor) integrated circuit technology, although the invention may be implemented in other technologies as well, as will be understood by one skilled in the art. A preferred embodiment incorporates transmit system <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> consisting of delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, encoder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and driver <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> fabricated on one silicon substrate. and receive system <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> consisting of clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, decoder <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and active diode bridge <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> fabricated on a second silicon substrate. The two separate silicon substrates are required to maintain the high voltage isolation provided by capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, since typical MOS technologies cannot provide high voltage isolation of 1000 volts or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter, shown as block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is well known in the art. See, for example, J. C. Candy, <highlight><italic>A Use of Double Integration in Sigma Delta Modulation, </italic></highlight>IEEE Trans. On Communication, March 1985, pp. 249-258, and B. E. Boser and B A. Wooley, <highlight><italic>The Design of Sigma-Delta Modulation Analog-to-Digital Converters, </italic></highlight>IEEE Journal Solid State Circuits, December, 1988, pp. 1298-1308. both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The specific design of ADC <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> will be a matter of design choice depending upon the needs of the particular application in which the isolation barrier will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The use of a delta-sigma converter within the isolation system provides several desirable features. It will be appreciated that the delta-sigma converter uses a high oversampling rate to provide accurate A/D conversion over the input signal bandwidth without the use of precisely matched components or high-order, analog anti-aliasing filters. Moreover, such converters occupy a relatively small amount of space on an integrated circuit and are relatively easy to fabricate on a CMTOS chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The digital pulse stream <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> output from delta-sigma converter <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> encodes the analog input signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in a pulse density modulation format. In pulse density modulation, the amplitude information of the analog input signal is contained in the density of output pulses generated during a given interval of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Suitable designs for oscillator circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are well known in the art and may typically comprise a ring oscillator, relaxation oscillator, or an oscillator based on a piezo-electric crystal disposed external to the integrated MOS circuit. See, for example, A. B. Grebene. <highlight><italic>Bipolar and MOS Analog Integrated Circuit Design, </italic></highlight>John Wiley and Sons, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> further illustrates the clock signals that may be provided to delta-sigma converter <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in a preferred embodiment of this invention. Clock signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> from oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is input to clock divider circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that divides the frequency of the input clock and provides an output in the form of two phase, non-overlapping clock signals &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, to the delta-sigma modulator circuit. The design and construction of clock divider circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is within the ordinary skill in the art and is not detailed here. Since encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> may perform time-division multiplexing of the digitized data signal <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> with digital control input data <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> using a time base derived from oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, clock divider <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> must typically divide the frequency of oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by at least a factor of two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates exemplary signals associated with clock divider circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and delta-sigma modulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Trace <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is the clock signal received from oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Trace <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is the &ldquo;clock divided by <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; signal that is generated by clock divider circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Traces <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> illustrate exemplary two phase, non-overlapping clock signals &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &thgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively, that may be output from clock divider circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to delta-sigma modulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Trace <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> represents the analog input to ADC <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which generally changes very slowly in comparison to the frequency of clock signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. This bandwidth relationship is required because the delta-sigma modulator must operate at a sampling rate much higher than a typical Nyquist rate (for example, a 1 MHz sampling rate for a 4 kHz voiceband signal is typical) in order for the information in the analog signal to be accurately represented by the single-bit binary output. Finally trace <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> represents the digital output of delta-sigma modulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which may, for example, be synchronized to the rising edge of clock signal &thgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(The illustrated output bit pattern <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is provided to show exemplary timing relationships and does not attempt to accurately reflect the illustrated analog input <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. the encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> performs two primary functions in preferred embodiments of this invention. The first function of encoder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is time-division multiplexing of control signals <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> from other circuit and data signals <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> from the delta-sigma modulator <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, an operation that is well known in the art and subject to many suitable implementations. The multiplexing function is synchronized by clock signals from oscillator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The second function of encoder <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is formatting the data for transmission across isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> details one coding scheme that may be used to transmit digital pulses across the capacitive isolation barrier. (Another suitable coding scheme is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>.) <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows the format for data sent from the transmit circuit to the receive circuit. When data&equals;1 for a given bit cell, the output of the encoder is high for the first quarter of the bit cell period. When data&equals;0 for a given bit cell. the output of the encoder is high for the third quarter of the bit cell period. This coding scheme Guarantees one low-to-high transition followed by one high-to-low transition for every bit cell period, independent of the data pattern. The resulting data independent transition density allows for robust clock recovery in the receiving circuitry on the other side of isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, robust clock recovery can also be achieved by use of a preamble used for frequency locking followed by a data pattern which is not of constant average frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In a bidirectional system, as is described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the transmit system encoder <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and driver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may cooperate to provide a high-impedance in-state output to the isolation capacitor <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> during either the last half of the bit cell period <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (if transmit data&equals;1) or the first half of the bit cell period <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> (if transmit data&equals;0) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. This permits transmission of information from the receive system to the transmit system during that portion of each bit cell when the transmit driver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is tri-stated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, at the beginning of each bit cell period the receive system decoder section <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> detects whether the transmit circuit has sent a data&equals;1 pulse across the isolation barrier. If a transmit data&equals;1 pulse was sent, the receive driver remains tri-stated until the second half of the bit cell period, during which time a receive data&equals;0 or 1 pulse can be sent back across the isolation barrier to the transmit system. If a transmit data&equals;1 pulse is not detected by the receive circuit the receive driver sends receive data&equals;0 or 1 during the first half of the bit cell period and in-states for the second half of the bit cell period. This operation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments in which the digital, bidirectional communication is differential. capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> are driven by complementary digital voltages in both directions. and the driver circuits associated with both capacitors are restated during selected portions of the bit cell period in accordance with the coding scheme shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the unidirectional driver circuit <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> for single ended (not differential) communication and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> For differential communication across the capacitive isolation barrier Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>. the transmit circuit driver <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may comprise an inverter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> driven by the encoder output signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> The output of inverter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> drives the transmit circuit side of isolation capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> to transmit logic levels defined by the transmit V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>and ground voltage levels. The clock recovery input buffer presents a high impedance to the receive side of capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the receive side of capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> to attain substantially the same logic levels as the transmit side of capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> In this manner the digital logic signal is effectively coupled across the capacitive isolation barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is disposed between the transmit circuit Ground node <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and receive circuit ground node <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> in order to form a ground current return path across the isolation barrier. Thus path is required because the clock recovery buffer input impedance, although high, is not infinite. Therefore a small current must flow across the barrier and back in order to couple the digital logic signal across the barrier. Furthermore, capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> must deliver charge to the active diode circuit <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in order that a supply voltage for several receive circuit sections can be provided. The current associated with this transfer of charge from the transmit circuit to the receive circuit must have a path to return to the transmit circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The single-ended communication system described above is insensitive to voltage signals that may exist between the transmit circuit ground <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and receive circuit ground <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> provided that the rate of change of such voltage signals is substantially less than the frequency of the digital signal transmitted across the barrier. The single-ended method is also insensitive to resistive and capacitive impedances that may exist between the transmit circuit ground <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and receive circuit ground <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The system can be desensitized to inductive impedances that may exist between the transmit circuit ground <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and receive circuit ground <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> by adding resistive elements in series with capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in series with the transmit ground connection <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, in series with the receive ground connection <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, or any combination of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> shows an example of a suitable differential driver <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> for unidirectional digital communication across a capacitive isolation barrier The inverter <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> that drives capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is driven by the digital signal output from the transmit encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, while inverter <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. which drives capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. is driven by the complement <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of the digital signal output from transmit encoder circuit <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Clock recovery; input buffer <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> presents high impedances to the receive sides of capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. allowing the differential digital transmit voltages to couple across the isolation barrier In this differential communication method. both capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provide return current paths across the isolation barrier. The differential digital communication system described above is largely insensitive to voltage signals and impedances that may exist between the transmit circuit ground <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> and receive circuit ground <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, since these voltages and impedances appear as common mode influences in differential communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Bidirectional communication across the barrier can be supported by additional driver and receive buffer structures, similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, without the need for any additional isolation elements, providing that inverters <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, which drive the high voltage isolation capacitors, can be tri-stated generally in accordance with the timing diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or any other suitable coding and timing scheme. In some embodiments. additional capacitor driving inverters that can be tri-stated may be provided in a receive-side driver circuit <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and input buffers may be provided in a transmit side decoder circuit <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In presently preferred embodiments, the actual isolation barrier comprises a pair of isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which are high voltage capacitors that may be chosen for a particular application to prevent DC and low frequency current flow across the barrier and protect the isolated circuitry from high voltage faults and transients, while permitting data at selected transmission frequencies to cross the barrier. The capacitors must be capable of withstanding anticipated voltages that may appear due to faults in the powered circuitry <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, in order to provide the protective function that is the purpose of the barrier. For example, in preferred embodiments ordinary 2000 volt capacitors with capacitance on the order of 100 pF may be utilized in the isolation barrier. In a barrier system in accordance with the present invention it is not necessary to use high precision capacitors, because the system is very tolerant of variations in capacitor performance due to environmental influences. such as variations in voltage and temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment for a clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> for use in this invention is detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and described below. One section of the clock recovery circuit may be a phase locked loop (&ldquo;PLL&rdquo;) circuit, consisting of phase/frequency detector <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, charge pump <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>, capacitor <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, and voltage controlled oscillator (&ldquo;VCO&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>. The other section of the clock recovery block is data latch <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> operating outside the phase locked loop to re-time the digital data received across the isolation barrier Circuitry for performing these functions is well known to those skilled in the art. See. for example, F Gardner. <highlight><italic>Phaselock Techniques, </italic></highlight>2d ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons. NY. 1979; and R. Best. <highlight><italic>Phase-Locked Loops, </italic></highlight>McGraw-Hill, 1984, which are incorporated herein by reference. The data input to the receive system from the isolation capacitors may be derived from a differential signal present at the barrier by passing the differential signal through MOS input buffers (not shown). which are well known in the art, and providing a single-ended binary output signal <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> to the clock recover., circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The illustrated exemplary phase/frequency detector <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> receives a digital input <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> from the isolation barrier and an input <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> from the output of VCO <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and performs a phase comparison between these two inputs. If the VCO phase lags the input data phase, a speed up signal <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> is supplied to charge pump <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>. If the input data <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> phase lags the VCO output <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> phase, a slow down signal <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is supplied to charge pump <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>. In response to &ldquo;speed up&rdquo; inputs from phase/frequency detector <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, charge pump <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> delivers a positive current to the loop filter consisting of resistor <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> and capacitor <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> connected in series. In response to &ldquo;slow down&rdquo; inputs from the phase/frequency detector, charge pump <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> sinks a positive current from the loop filter. The output voltage of the loop filter at node <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> drives voltage controlled oscillator <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, which increases its operation frequency as the Input voltage increases. The output of VCO <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is fed back as input <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> to phase/frequency detector <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, and it is also used to re-time the input data <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> by serving as the clock input to flip-flop latch <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, thus providing a clock signal to the isolated circuitry and also providing data signal <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> that is synchronized to clock signal <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. A divider circuit may be included in the feedback path <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The phase/frequency detector and charge pump operate to increase loop filter voltage <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and VCO frequency if VCO phase <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> lags input data phase <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the VCO frequency is decreased if the VCO phase leads input data phase. In this manner, the VCO output phase is adjusted until phase lock is achieved with input data. Consequently, the VCO frequency is driven to be substantially identical to the input data frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If noise interference occurs at the isolation barrier, the input data transitions will occur at points in time that are noisy, or jittered, relative to the transition times of the transmit circuit driver. These jittered data edges will cause a noise component in the charge pump current that drives the loop filter. The loop filter and VCO, however, low-pass filter this noise component. substantially attenuating the effects of this input data jitter. Consequently, the VCO output signal, while frequency locked to the input data, contains substantially less phase noise than the noisy input data. The bandwidth of the phase noise filtering operation may be set independently of the bandwidth of the analog signal to be communicated across the isolation barrier. Since the Filtered, phase locked loop output clock signal <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> is used to latch or re-time the noisy input data at flip flop <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, the effects of noise interference at the capacitive isolation barrier are substantially eliminated. Finally. the filtered. phase locked loop output clock signal <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> is used as the timebase or clock for the other receive circuits. including decoder <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> and delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, resulting in an analog output <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the capacitive isolation system that is substantially free from any noise interference that may have been introduced at the capacitive isolation banner. </paragraph>

The active diode bridge generates a DC power supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>DD</subscript></highlight>, which may be used to operate the clock recovery and receiver decoder circuits, in response to the digital data received across the capacitive isolation barrier. An active diode bundle circuit is distinguished from a standard or passive diode bridge in that the gating elements are active transistors rather than passive elements such as bipolar diodes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, the operation of the active diode bridge circuit used in single-ended digital communication will now be described. A digital logic signal is coupled across capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> from the transmit section. When a digital &ldquo;high&rdquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, node <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> goes high. The logic &ldquo;high&rdquo; signal on node <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> forces the CMTOS inverter <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> output node to go low, turning off device <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> and turning on device <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. Consequently, current flows through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, device <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, and from VDD to receive circuit ground through Capacitor C<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and through clock recovery and decoder circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The circuit is completed by current flow returning across the isolation barrier through capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The current demand by circuitry on V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>through capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must be limited so that the voltage on node <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> relative to node <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> can still be recognized as a digital high logic level. When a digital &lsquo;low&rsquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, CMTOS inverter <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> turns off device <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> and turns on device <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> Consequently, current flows across the isolation barrier through capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, through device <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, and returns across the isolation barrier through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> Therefore. although no average current flows through capacitors <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, average current can be supplied from V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>to receive circuit ground to operate clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and decoder circuit <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>.

When a digital &lsquo;high&rsquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, a corresponding digital &lsquo;low&rsquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and node <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> goes high while node <highlight><bold>647</bold></highlight> goes low. This condition turns on devices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> while turning off devices <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. Consequently, current flows through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, device <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>, from V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>to ground through capacitor C<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and through clock recovery circuitry <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and decoder circuitry <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

The current demand on V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>must be limited so that the voltage on node <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> relative to node <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> can be recognized as a high logic level signal by the clock recovery and decoder circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When a digital &lsquo;low&rsquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, a digital &lsquo;high&rsquo; signal is received through capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and node <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight> goes low while node <highlight><bold>647</bold></highlight> goes high.

An added benefit of the ability to power sections of the isolated circuitry from the digital signal transmitted across the capacitive isolation barrier from the powered circuitry is that it allows isolated power-up and power-down control of isolated circuitry sections on an as-needed basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Parasitic bipolar transistors may result from typical CMOS processes. If they are not controlled. these bipolar transistors can discharge the power supply <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> during the initial power up time. If the discharge current from the parasitic bipolar transistors is larger than the current delivered to the power supply <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> through transistor <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, then the circuit may not power up to the desired full voltage level. The beta of a lateral bipolar transistor in any CMTOS process is a function of layout. With appropriate layout (i.e., large base region), the beta can be kept small enough to minimize undesired discharge currents. Further care needs to be taken in the design of any circuit that is connected to power supply <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight>. The circuits connected to power supply <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> cannot draw more current from the power supply than is available from the active diode bridge, even before the supply has ramped to the full value.

Analog output signal <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is generated by DAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in response to the digital data that is communicated across the capacitive isolation barrier. The output signal <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is highly immune to amplitude and phase noise that may be introduced in the barrier circuitry because the signal that is communicated across the isolation capacitors is a synchronous digital signal, and because the received data is resynchronized to the recovered, jitter-filtered clock signal. The DAC is also timed by that clock signal. Delta-sigma DAC technology is well known in the art, and selecting a suitable DAC circuit will be a matter of routine design choice directed to the intended application of the barrier circuit.

Naus et al., <highlight><italic>A CMOS Stereo </italic></highlight>16-<highlight><italic>Bit D/A Converter for Digital Audio, </italic></highlight>IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a preferred bidirectional embodiment of the present invention. It will be recognized that other unidirectional and bidirectional isolation barriers may be designed by persons skilled in the art using the principles described herein, and that such barriers will fall within the scope of this invention. In the illustrated and described embodiment, the capacity isolation system comprises a &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; system to the left of center. a &ldquo;receive&rdquo; system to the right of center, and a capacitive isolation barrier in the center of the figure comprising two high voltage capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Note that the terms &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; and &ldquo;receive&rdquo; are used to identity the powered and isolated sides of the barrier. respectively, and that in this embodiment data may be conveyed across the barrier in both directions Many of the components in this bidirectional embodiment are identical or similar to those in the unidirectional embodiment described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The transmit system includes delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> operable on the analog input <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of the transmit circuit and synchronized to clock signal <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> from oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The analog input <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of the transmit system is an analog signal containing information to be transmitted across the isolation barrier, which may be for example an analog voice signal to be coupled to a telephone system. Digital output <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> of the delta-sigma ADC may be time-division multiplexed with digital control input <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> by the encoder circuit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Digital control input <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> is a digital signal containing additional information to be transmitted across isolation barrier <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Digital control input <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> may include control information for analog circuitry on the receiving side of the isolation barrier. Encoder circuit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> also formats the resulting data stream into a coding scheme that allows for robust clock recovery on the receiving side of the isolation barrier, as is described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Encoder circuit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> also receives a clock signal <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> from oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Driver circuit <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> of the transmit system drives the encoded signal to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> in response to the output of encoder circuit <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The isolation barrier comprises two high voltage capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, capacitor <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is driven bidirectionally by drivers <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> while capacitor <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> provides a return path across the isolation barrier. In another embodiment of the present invention, capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> are differentially driven by digital driver circuits <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the receive system, shown to the right of isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> includes clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, whose inputs are connected to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The clock recovery circuit recovers a clock signal from the digital data driven across the isolation barrier and provides synchronized clock signal <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> to the various circuits in the receive system. The recovered clock operates as the time base for decoder <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and delta-sigma digital-to-analog converter <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. Decoder section <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> separates the time division multiplexed data and control information, providing digital control output <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> to other circuitry, and providing synchronous data signal <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> as an input to delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. The delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>, with digital input <highlight><bold>734</bold></highlight> supplied by decoder <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, and clock signal <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> supplied by clock recovery section <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, operates synchronously with the transmit system delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and provides analog output <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> on the receiving side of the isolation barrier. Active diode bridge <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is connected to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and supplies a DC power supply voltage to clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and decoder circuit <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> by drawing current from the digital signal transmitted across the isolation barrier, as is described in detail above. Driver <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> must remain tristated until decoder <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> has detected a valid frame, indicating successful power-up of the receive circuit sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also enables communication from the receive system to the transmit system. or from right to left across the isolation capacitors as illustrated. The receive system encoder circuit <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and driver circuit <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> cooperate to communicate information back from the receive system to the decoder circuit <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> in the transmit system. Receive system encoder section <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> receives a clock input <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> from clock recovery section <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, and is thereby synchronized to the transmit system oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and encode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. This synchronization allows transmission in each direction to occur in distinct time slots. In time slots where transmit driver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is operable to transmit information from the transmit system to the receive system, receive driver <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is tristated or disabled. Alternatively, in time slots where receive driver <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is operable to transmit information back from the receive system to the transmit system, transmit driver <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is in-stated or disabled. In this manner. bidirectional communication may be established across a single pair of high voltage isolation capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Digital control input <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> of the receive system is a digital signal containing information to be communicated across the isolation barrier, including control information for analog circuitry on the transmit system side of the barrier. The receive system also includes delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> operable on analog input signal <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> so that the information contained in analog signal <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> on the receive system side of the isolation barrier can be conveyed across the barrier in digital form and then accurately reproduced on the transmit system side of the barrier. The receive system delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> receives its clock input from clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, and is thereby synchronized with transmit system oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> Digital output signal <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> generated by receive system ADC <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> may be time-division multiplexed with receive system digital control input <highlight><bold>738</bold></highlight> in encoder section <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the transmit system, decoder circuit <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is connected to isolation capacitors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> to receive signals therefrom, identify signals representing information coming from the receive system. Decoder <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> then extracts the digital control information from the data stream received from the receive circuit, and passes data signal <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> generated by delta-sigma ADC <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> to transmit system delta-signal DAC <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight>. Decoder <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> also latches and retires the data received across the barrier to synchronize it with clock signal <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, which is generated by oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, thereby eliminating the effects of phase noise interference and other sources of jitter in the synchronous digital signal Circuits that are suitable for performing these decoder functions are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Transmit system delta-sigma DAC <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> receives its clock input from oscillator <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and is thereby synchronized to receive system ADC <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. Transmit system DAC <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> provides a reconstructed analog data output signal <highlight><bold>746</bold></highlight>. thereby completing the communication of analog information back from the receive system to the transmit system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In summary, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> describes a bidirectional communication system for convening analog and digital information across a capacitive isolation barrier. The barrier itself is inexpensive, since only two high voltage isolation capacitors are required for synchronous, bidirectional communication. The barrier is a reliable communication channel because the digital signals communicated across the barrier are insensitive to amplitude and phase noise interference that may be introduced at the isolation barrier </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A more detailed description of a clock recovery circuit suitable for use in this invention with the coding scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will now be provided, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Clock recovery PLL <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> has data input <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, data output <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> and recovered clock signal output <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. Phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> has inputs DATA <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and feedback clock signal CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. The outputs of phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> are SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signals, both of which are connected to inputs of phase detector charge pump <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. Frequency detector <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> has inputs DATA <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and output clock signal CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. The outputs of frequency detector <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are signals designated SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are connected to the inputs of frequency detector charge pump <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight>. The outputs of phase detector charge pump <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> and frequency detector charge pump <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight> are connected together and are also connected to the input of voltage controlled oscillator (&ldquo;VCO&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and one terminal of resistor <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>. The other terminal of resistor <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> is connected to one terminal of capacitor <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>. The other terminal of capacitor <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The output of VCO <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is the CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signal <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. The clock input of flip-flop <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight> is connected to CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>. The Q-bar output of flip-flop <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight> is connected to the D input of flip-flop <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight>. The Q and Q-bar outputs of flip-flop <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight> are connected to the inputs of multiplexer (mux) <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight>. The control input <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> of mux <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> is called MUX CONTROL and comes from the framing logic, which is described elsewhere in this specification. The output of mux <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> Is the CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signal <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. The D input of flip-flop <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> is connected to data input <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The clock input of flip-flop <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> is connected to the CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signal <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>. The Q output of flip-flop <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> is the resynchronized DATAOUT signal <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, which is sent to the frame detect logic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Frequency detector <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> is dominant over phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> when the frequency of the DATA and CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signals are different. Once the frequency of the DATA and CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signals are substantially similar, the SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signals become inactive and phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> becomes dominant. Separate charge pumps for the phase detector and frequency detector allow for independent control of the gain of the phase detector and frequency detector circuits Alternatively, if independent gains are not required. then the SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signals could be logically ORed together to drive one charge pump. And likewise the SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signals could be logically ORed together to drive the other input to the charge pump </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The output of VCO <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> the CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signal, which is divided by two in frequency by flip-flop <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight> Since CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is divided by two to generate the bit rate clock signal CK<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there can be two phases of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with respect to the start of a bit period. The phase of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that will yield correct operation of the frequency detector is the one where the using edge of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> aligns with the start of a bit period. The frame-detect logic is needed to detect the start of a bit interval and is used to select the appropriate phase of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> using mux <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that a clock recovery circuit according to this invention. such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, may be beneficially used to recover and stabilize a clock signal on the isolated side of the barrier where the clock signal is conveyed via isolation elements that are separate from the isolation elements that are used to transfer the data signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of a decoder circuit <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Shift register <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> has an input connected to the DATAOUT signal <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> from clock recovery circuit <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> and is clocked by recovered clock signal CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Multi-bit output <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight> of shift register <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> is connected to frame-detect logic <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> and to demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight>. Frame detect logic <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> has one output connected to mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight> and one output connected to demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight>. Demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight> is clocked by CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Counter <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> is also clocked by CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The output of counter <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> is connected to mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight>. The output of mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight> is the MUX-CONTROL signal <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> sent to the clock recovery PLL <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> to select the proper phase for the CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signal. The outputs of demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight> are the DEMUXED DATA signal and the CONTROL signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Shift register <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> stores a predetermined number of bits of the serial DATAOUT signal <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. Frame-detect logic <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> operates on this data and detects when a frame signal is received. Many possible framing signal formats can be used. A format that may be used in a presently preferred embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Data <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> is alternated with framing signals <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> and control signals. In the framing format shown in this figure, one control signal (off hook) <highlight><bold>864</bold></highlight> is sent for every eight data bits. The remaining seven bits in the frame of sixteen are used for frame synchronization. The illustrated framing signal is six ones followed by a zero in the control signal field. The data signal may be guaranteed to not have more than five ones in a row so that it will not be mistaken for a framing signal. Many other framing formats are possible to allow for different data signal properties and to permit the use of additional control bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Once the frame detect logic <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> detects six one&apos;s followed by a zero in the control signal field. mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight> is set to maintain the phase of the CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signal. If after a predetermined number of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> clock cycles a framing signal is not detected. then counter <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> will cause mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight> to change the phase of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> using mux <highlight><bold>828</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) Counter <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> will then be reset, and frame detect logic <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> will again attempt to detect the selected framing signal so as to achieve synchronization. Only the correct phase of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will achieve frame synchronization Once frame synchronization is achieved, demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight> can correctly decode control and data signals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The specific structure and operation of frame detect logic <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, demux logic <highlight><bold>846</bold></highlight>, and mux control logic <highlight><bold>848</bold></highlight> is dependent upon the selected framing format the selected multiplexing scheme, and other design choices. The detailed design of this circuitry is within the ordinary skill in the art and is omitted from this description of a preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Exemplary embodiments of phase and frequency detectors <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> has input signals CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and DATA and output signals SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A two input NAND gate <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> has inputs DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and its output is connected to one input of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight>. A two input NOR gate <highlight><bold>864</bold></highlight> also has inputs DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and its output is connected to the input of inverter <highlight><bold>866</bold></highlight>. A two input NAND gate <highlight><bold>868</bold></highlight> has one input connected to the output of the inverter <highlight><bold>866</bold></highlight> and one input connected to the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight>. NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> has one input that is connected to the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> and the other input connected to the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>868</bold></highlight>. A three input AND gate <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> has one input connected DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the output of inverter <highlight><bold>872</bold></highlight>, another input connected to the DATA signal and another input connected to the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight>. The output of AND gate <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> is the SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signal. The input of inverter <highlight><bold>872</bold></highlight> is connected to the CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signal. A three input AND gate <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight> has one input connected to the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight>, another input is connected to the CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signal and another input is connected to the output of inverter <highlight><bold>876</bold></highlight>. The output of AND gate <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight> is the SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signal. The input of inverter <highlight><bold>876</bold></highlight> is connected to receive the DATA signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, phase detector <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> compares the phase on the falling edges of DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after both signals are high at the same time. NAND gates <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>868</bold></highlight> form a set-reset type latch. The latch gets &ldquo;set&rdquo; such that the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> is high when both the DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> signals are high. The latch gets &ldquo;reset&rdquo; such that the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>862</bold></highlight> is low when both DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are low. When the latch is &ldquo;set&rdquo; (i.e., both DATA and CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are high), AND gates <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight> are enabled. Once the AND gates <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>874</bold></highlight> are enabled they can compare the falling edges of CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and DATA to determine which signal goes low first. If DATA goes low First, then the SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signal will go high until CK<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also goes low, indicating that oscillator <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> needs to oscillate faster in order to achieve phase alignment with the DATA signal. If the CK<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signal goes low first then the SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signal will go high until DATA also goes low. indicating that oscillator <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> should oscillate slower in order to achieve phase alignment with the DATA signal. The SPEED-UP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and SLOW-DOWN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> signals are connected to phase detector charge-pump <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiment of frequency detector <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> counts the number of DATA pulses within one CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> cycle. The frequency of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> should equal to the bit rate of the DATA pattern. Suitable encoding used for the DATA signal will ensure that there will be only one CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rising edge for each data pulse falling edge, if the frequency of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is equal to the data rate. If the CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> frequency is equal to the data rate then the Q-output of flip-flop <highlight><bold>888</bold></highlight> will be high prior to each rising edge of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the Q-outputs of flip-flops <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>892</bold></highlight> will be low prior to each rising edge of CK<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary data coding scheme that may be used in an isolation system constructed in accordance with this invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> In this scheme. each bit period <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is split into four fields. The first field <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight> is referred to as the clock field and is always high independent of the data being transferred. The second field <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight>, which may occupy the second quarter of the bit period <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, contains the forward-going (from transmit side to receive side) data bit. This data bit can be either the delta-sigma data bit or a control bit or any desired type of encoding bit. in accordance with the requirements of the application in which the invention is used. The third field <highlight><bold>576</bold></highlight>. which may occupy the third quarter of the bit period. is always low to ensure enough signal transitions to provide for power transmission in the forward path along with the first two fields, at least one of which is high in each bit period. The forward (transmit side) driver circuit is in-stated during the fourth field <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight>, thus allowinng for data transmission in the opposite direction across the isolation capacitor Of course, this particular coding scheme is provided as an example, and many other coding schemes may be devised that will be operable in the various embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to use the logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; that is present at the beginning of each bit period for clock recovery, since it is always present at periodic intervals. However, if the reverse data bit from the previous bit period is a one, the using edge at the beginning of the next bit period will not be readily seen by a logic gate and therefore will not be useful for clock recovery. To mitigate this effect and to allow reliable clock recovery, every fourth bit in the reverse field may be guaranteed to be zero by the encoding algorithms that are employed. The total frame length can be increased if more control bits need to be sent across the barrier in the reverse direction. Every fourth clock edge (the one associated with a zero in the previous reverse bit field) may then be used for clock recovery. </paragraph>
