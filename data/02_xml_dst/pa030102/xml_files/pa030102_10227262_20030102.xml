<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to the formation of a high density pattern for field emitter tips for field emission display (FED) devices. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method of formation of a high density pattern for field emitter tips for FEDs using microspheres and/or nanospheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Field emission display (FED) devices are of the type of flat panel display in which a baseplate with a generally planar emitter substrate is juxtaposed to a faceplate with a substantially transparent display screen. The baseplate has a number of emitters formed in the emitter substrate that project from the emitter substrate towards the faceplate. The emitters are typically configured into discrete emitter sets in which the bases of the emitters of each emitter set are commonly connected. The baseplate also has an insulator layer formed on the emitter substrate and an extraction grid formed on the insulator layer. A number of holes are formed through the insulator layer and extraction grid in alignment with the emitters to open the emitters to the faceplate. In operation, a voltage differential is established between the extraction grid and the emitter to extract electrons from the emitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The display screen of the faceplate is coated with substantially transparent conductive material to form an anode, and the anode is coated with a cathodoluminescent layer. The anode draws the electrons extracted from the emitters through the extraction grid and the cathodoluminescent layer of material. As the electrons strike the cathodoluminescent layer, light emits from the impact site and travels through the anode and the glass panel of the display screen. The emitted light from each of the areas becomes all or part of a picture element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In field emission displays, it is desirable to have a bright display at each picture element thereof in response to the emitted electrons from the emitters in the emitter set. The brightness at each picture element of a field emission display depends upon the density of the emitters in the emitter sets corresponding to each picture element. It is desirable to have a constant emitter density from one emitter set to another and from one area of the emitter set to another therein. It is further desirable to have the emitters spaced the same distance apart from other emitters in the same emitter set, and to have the emitters of each emitter set substantially the same size and overall shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One method for forming emitters is using photolithographic techniques. However, it is difficult to form conically shaped emitters using photolithographic techniques in high densities and over large areas using photolithographic techniques. Therefore, it is desirable to have an easily reproducible technique to form high densities of emitters over large areas for any desired size of field emission displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another method of forming emitters for field emission displays, illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,407,695, a large area lithographic mask is produced on the surface of a substrate by coating the substrate with a monolayer of colloidal particles such that the particles are fixed to the substrate. Depending upon the disposition technique used, the colloidal particles may be arranged on the surface of the substrate in either a random or ordered array. The array of particles can then be used as a lithographic mask and the random or ordered array can be transferred to the substrate using a suitable etching process. Alternately, the lithographic mask may be used as a deposition mask. The emitters are formed by randomly distributing a number of beads on a hard oxide layer that has been deposited over the emitter substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,238, sharp sub-micron emitter tips for field emission displays are formed without requiring photolithography. Vapor deposition is used to randomly located discrete nuclei to form a discontinuous etch mask. The nuclei are preferably non-polymerized with a relatively high melting point to assure that an ion etch produces pyramid shaped tips with a suitable enhancement factor. In one instance, an etch is applied to low work function material covered by randomly located nuclei to form emission tips in the low work function material. In another instance, an etch is applied to a base material covered by randomly located nuclei to form tips in the base material which are then coated with low work function material to form emission tips. Diamond is the preferred low work function material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,853, a mask and method of making the mask comprises distributing a mixture of mask particles and spacer particles across a layer of material on a semiconductor wafer. The spacer particles space the mask particles apart from one another to prevent the mask particles from clustering together and to control the distance between mask particles. The mixture is preferably deposited onto the layer of material to form a substantially contiguous monolayer of mask and spacer particles across the surface of the wafer. The spacer particles are then selectively removed from the surface to the layer such that the mask particles remain on the layer in a pattern of spaced apart masked elements. The spacer and mask particles are preferably made from material with different etching selectivities that allow the spacer particles to be selectively etched from the wafer. In other instances, the physical differences may allow the spacer particles to be removed by selectively breaking a bond between the spacer particles and the surface layer, or by selectively evaporating, sublimating, or melting the spacer particles from the layer of material. The spacer particles and the underlying layer of material upon which the spacer particles are deposited are preferably made from materials that may be selectively etched without etching the mask particles. The spacer particles and the underlying layer of material may accordingly be etched in a single process step to form a desired pattern of island-like elements under the mask particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,156, a method is disclosed wherein the deposition of latex spheres on a sacrificial layer on a substrate, shrinking of the spheres, depositing a metal over the spheres, dissolving the spheres, etching the substrate through the openings formed by removing the spheres, removing the remaining metal, and depositing the desired microstructure material over the sacrificial layer are used to form a textured top surface of the sacrificial layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,658, a non-photolithographic, physical patterning process is described for the selective etching of a substrate. The process comprises electrostatically charging liquid droplets which are selectively etchable with respect to the substrate, dispersing the droplets onto the substrate in a pattern, and etching the substrate using the droplets as a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another instance, self-assembled polystyrene beads whose diameter can be arbitrarily reduced by reactive ion etching are used to produce a hole array on a silicon substrate which is subsequently filled with material. The beads may have a diameter to allow the formation of a nanostructure array. Alternately, latex beads may be used rather than polystyrene beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another instance, micron and sub-micron holes are formed in field emitter displays which use microspheres to bring parallel beams of ultraviolet radiation into numerous foci on a photoresist which is used as a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In all the described prior art processes, none provides a simple, nonphotolithographic process for the manufacture of emitters for a field emission display using a minimum of process steps wherein a high density of emitters in the emitter set is of substantially equal spacing from adjacent emitters and of substantially equal height. Therefore, a need exists for such a process for the forming of a high density of emitters in the emitter set for a field emission display. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> representative field emission display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> employing a display segment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is depicted. Each display segment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is capable of displaying a pixel of information, or a portion of a pixel, as, for example, one green dot of a green/red/blue full-color triad pixel. Preferably, a single crystal silicon layer serves as a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternately, amorphous silicon deposited on an underlying substrate comprised largely of glass or other combination may be used so long as a material capable of conducting electric current is present on the surface of a substrate so that it can be patterned and etched to form microcathodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At an emission site of a field emission display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (emitter or tip) has been constructed on a substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a protuberance which may have a variety of shapes, such as pyramidal, conical, or other geometry which has a fine micro-point for the emission of electrons therefrom. Surrounding the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a grid structure <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. When a desired voltage differential, through source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is applied between the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and grid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a stream of electrons <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is emitted (shown in dotted lines) toward phosphor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> coated on an anode screen forming a faceplate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed integrally with the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternately, the micro-cathode may be formed on a variety of layered and non-layered substrates and materials. Grid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> serves as a structure for applying an electrical field potential to its respective micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A dielectric insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deposited on the conductive micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> therein at the field emission site locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Support structures <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are disposed between an electrode faceplate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a baseplate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to support the atmospheric pressure which exists on the faceplate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a result of the vacuum created between baseplate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and faceplate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is important to have uniform circular etch masks in a high density uniform pattern for the etching process of forming the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the density, sharpness, and uniformity of the microcathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> affecting the clarity and/or resolution of the field emission display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The baseplate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a matrix of an addressable array of cold micro-cathode emission structures <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on which the emission structures are formed, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the anode grid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While many suitable substrate materials <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be used, a preferred substrate material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a 14-21 ohms-cms P-type 1-0-0 single crystal silicon material for the formation of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the process of the present invention, the mask dimensions, the balancing of the gases, and parameters in the plasma etch will enable the manufacturer to determine and thereby control the dimensions of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is illustrated having a coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon and a plurality of spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> located on the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Of the plurality of spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, some spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have a diameter smaller or larger than other spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to the variation of the diameter of the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during manufacturing processes and the range of sizes of spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relating to a nominal size thereof, such as a microsphere having a nominal diameter of two (2) microns may vary in diameter from 2.5 microns to 1.5 microns in diameter while still being referred to as a 2 micron diameter microsphere. The substrate can be amorphous silicon overlying glass, polysilicon, or any other suitable material from which the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be fabricated. The coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is used as a hard mask for the forming of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is preferably of silicon dioxide having a thickness of approximately 0.2 &mgr;m, the composition and dimensions of the mask formed by coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> affecting the ability of the mask areas of coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to remain balanced at the apex of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and to remain centered on the apex of the microcathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> during the overetch thereof. &ldquo;Overetch&rdquo; refers to the time period when the etch process is continued after a substantially full undercut is achieved. &ldquo;Full undercut&rdquo; refers to the point at which the lateral removal of material is equal to the original lateral dimension of the mask formed of the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are preferably polystyrene having a diameter in the microsphere and/or nanosphere range. Further, the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be of latex material, or any suitable readily available material for use, such as silicon spheres having a metal base, etc. However, since the brightness, clarity, and/or resolution of the field emission display is dependent upon the density and uniformity of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the smallest diameter sphere is preferred to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As previously stated, the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have substantially the same diameter with a typical variation thereof due to variation of the manufacture and grading of the spheres into diameter size ranges. The spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are applied to the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon as a substantially uniform monolayer without clustering or clumping of the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with individual spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being as evenly spaced from one another as possible for a substantially uniform layer having as few discontinuities or holes therein with the individual spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having their peripheries substantially abutting to form a substantially uniform, dense monolayer of spheres. The spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be applied to the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon as spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> suspended in a volatile liquid, dispensed onto the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the substrate is rotating, and the liquid evaporated, leaving the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a substantially monolayer of spheres. A suitable volatile liquid is water and/or alcohol. Alternately, the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be dry dispensed onto the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon using an air jet or other gas to propel the spheres towards the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> settling on the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form a substantially contiguous monolayer layer with their peripheries abutting thereon. Further, if desired, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon may be electrically charged or have areas thereof electrically charged to attract and retain the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a substantially monolayer thereon to form the display segments <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been reduced, or shrunk, in diameter by the oxidation thereof using a reactive ion etch process, such as a reactive ion etch process using oxygen gas. In this manner, the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are no longer abutting each other but are substantially uniformly spaced substantially as a monolayer on the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that although the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are of slightly differing diameter, as the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are reduced in diameter during the etching process, a small change in the diameter of a sphere greatly reduces the volume of the sphere, thereby creating the space between the spheres. For example, when using spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a diameter of 2 microns and subsequently reduced to a diameter of 1.6 to 1.0 microns, a 4/8/10 fold increase in the number and density of potential micro-cathodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) results over a comparable photolithography process of forming micro-cathodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, after the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been reduced in diameter, an anisotropic etch using suitable well-known gases in a reactive ion etching process is performed on the coating of silicon dioxide <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a mask to form substantially circular openings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each circular opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a substantially vertical sidewall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereon as a result of the anisotropic etch of the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The remaining coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> located beneath each reduced diameter sphere of the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being a substantially circular island-like area having a diameter substantially the same as the diameter of the reduced diameter sphere <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When polystyrene or latex spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are used, a suitable well-known anisotropic etch chemistry selective to silicon oxide includes, but is not limited to: CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, CHF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and He. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is illustrated having the substantially circular island-like areas of the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereon being used as a mask for the etching process with the spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> removed from the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The spheres <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be removed from the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having the substantially circular island-like areas of the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed thereon using typical photoresist removal techniques, such as chemicals, etches, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is illustrated after the silicon etch step to form the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Typically, a plasma etch with selectivity to the etch mask formed by the substantially circular island-like areas of the coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is employed to form the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; preferably, in the case of a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a plasma containing a fluorinated gas, such as SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, NF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, or CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, in combination with a chlorinated gas, such as HCl or Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, is used. Most preferably, the plasma comprises a combination of NF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, having an additive, such as helium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The etch continues until all of the micro-cathodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> forming on the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> have completely undercut the substantially circular island mask areas of coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the parameters for the etching process being well known and understood, such as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,259, which is incorporated herein by reference. The etch is continued until a full undercut is obtained for the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with minimal change to the functional shape of the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> until substantially all micro-cathodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have a substantially identical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, after the tips forming the micro-cathodes have been formed to the desired dimensions, the mask areas of coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are removed with the micro-cathode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> remaining as illustrated. The mask areas of coating <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be stripped by any well-known method, such as a wet etch using a hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution or other HF containing mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from the foregoing that, in contrast to the prior art processes, the present invention is used to form a high density of uniform shape and height micro-cathodes in a substrate for use in a field emission display through a simple process of using few process steps and without the use of lithography. The density of the micro-cathodes is determined by the diameter of the spheres, and their reduced diameter, used to form a mask for the etching of the micro-cathodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that various modifications, changes, additions, deletions, and revisions of the invention may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
