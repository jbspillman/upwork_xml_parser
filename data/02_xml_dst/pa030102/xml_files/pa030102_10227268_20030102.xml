<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical amplifier, a method of controlling an excitation light source in an optical amplifier, and a method of controlling an optical amplifier which are suitably employed for use in, for example, a wavelength multiplexing optical communication system, when increasing or decreasing the number of channels in signal light (the number of wavelengths to be multiplexed in-signal light) while the system is in operation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the recent years, wavelength multiplexing optical communication systems have been investigated and developed very actively, and studies have taken place to develop a system which is capable of increasing the number of channels in signal light in answer to the demand for communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, a desire exists to upgrade the amplification scale of an optical amplifier, being an essential component of this wavelength multiplexing optical communication system, in accordance with the increase in the number of channels. A similar need also exists on an optical amplifier included in a light wave network or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To meet such a requirement, consideration may be given to a construction in which an optical amplifier capable of amplifying multi-wavelength (for example, approximately 32 channels) multiplexed signal light is introduced from the initial operation into an optical communication system, thus coping with the increase in the number of channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In this instance, although being equipped with an excitation light source, for handling the multi-wavelength multiplexed signal light, the optical amplifier is required to be provided with an excitation-light source which is capable of supplying a large quantity of excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in addition to the fact that the excitation light source is usually expensive, a small number of channels (for example, approximately 4 channels) are frequently used at the beginning of the system operation, and therefore, if such an optical amplifier capable of dealing with multi-wavelength multiplexed signal light is employed from the first system operation, there is a problem in that the initial investment for the equipment increases to lower the investment efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For this reason, in order to enhance the equipment investment efficiency, consideration can be given to that another excitation light source is added to the existing optical amplifier in accordance with an increase in the number of channels in signal light while the optical communication system is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, if the additional excitation light source is introduced into the control loop of the preexisting excitation light source, the control of these excitation light sources can frequently go unstable. More specifically, supposing that the quantity of an excitation light required for when the optical amplifier obtains a predetermined gain (excitation optical power) is P, difficulty is encountered to singly determine the combination of excitation optical powers of these two excitation light sources to be P in total, so that a plurality of stable operating points appear, which results in unstable excitation light source control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, consideration should also be given to the fact that, after an additional excitation light source is installed to increase the number of channels in signal light, the number of channels is decreased depending on the demand for communications while the optical communication system is in operation, and further, that a need can occur to remove the additionally installed excitation light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the optical communication system being in operation, in order to coping with the increase/decrease in the number of channels, there is a need to provide a construction which allows the installation or the removal of an additional excitation light source without interfering with the working channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been developed in consideration of such problems, and it is therefore an object of this invention to provide an optical amplifier, an excitation light source control method for use in an optical amplifier and an optical amplifier control method which are capable of stably installing or removing an additional excitation light source in accordance with an increase/decrease in the number of channels in signal light even if the optical communication system is in operation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is capable of amplifying signal light in answer to the case that the number of channels in signal light increases or decreases while the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in use (while operating), and this function principally relies on the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the monitoring photodiode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is for amplifying signal light inputted through the components on the input side at a predetermined gain by the excitation energy of excitation light supplied from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and outputting the amplified signal light, and is made up of a rare earth doped fiber &lsqb;concretely, Erbium-Doped Fiber (EDF)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a light source which supplies excitation light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and is made so that its excitation light output quantity is controlled by the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in an analog manner. This main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exists from the first operation in the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is for outputting excitation light corresponding to 8 channels (excitation light of a quantity required for amplifying signal light corresponding to 8 channels) as an expected maximum output, and for the purpose of securing a control dynamic range for one channel (see the reference mark D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), there is a need to use a type capable of outputting excitation light for extra two channels. That is, as this main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, employed is a type which is capable of outputting excitation light corresponding to 10 channels in total as the maximum output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Still further, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a light source for supplying excitation light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and the control for the presence or absence of the output of its excitation light (ON/OFF control) is implemented through the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>.

At this time, the reference value (the value of the output level of the signal light corresponding to the number of channels after the increase) to be taken for the level-fixing control is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> If the number of channels increases from &ldquo;8&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo;, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> controls the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs excitation light in a quantity conforming to the number of channels in the signal light after the increase (the excitation light quantity corresponding to 9 channels), exceeding the maximum excitation light quantity the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is expected to supply (the excitation light quantity corresponding to 8 channels).

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in response to a freeze release signal from the OS (the signal transmission section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) side, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> returns the attenuation factor of the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the variable condition to conduct the above-mentioned freeze release processing for the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B turns ON the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is controlled to output excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In this way, as indicated by the reference mark B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, undergoing only the ON/OFF-control, gradually outputs excitation light, while the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, being under the level-fixing control, outputs excitation light in a quantity determined considering the excitation light quantity outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Finally, the excitation light corresponding to one channel is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the excitation light corresponding to 8 channels is outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thus causing the output of the excitation light corresponding to 9 channels in total. Incidentally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> fully rises within the guard time E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the first embodiment, since the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON after the number of channels has been increased from &ldquo;8&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo;, it is possible to prevent a lack of the control dynamic range (see the reference mark D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), which would occur when the output excitation light quantity from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes zero. Accordingly, it is possible to more certainly accomplish the output control of the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Additionally, because of slowly building up the excitation light of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the control of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is followable, and the amplification of the signal light is feasible without adversely affecting the other channels before increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Besides, if the number of channels in signal light increases but does not exceed 8 channels, the excitation light from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> (2) Instance wherein the Number of Channels in Signal Light to be Inputted to Optical Amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> Decreases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In this instance, as a premise, let it be assumed that the signal light to be inputted to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> holds 9 or more channels and that, in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> cooperatively output excitation light in an amount corresponding to the number of channels in the signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The following description is about the case that the number of channels in the signal light decreases from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;8&rdquo;. At this time, the excitation light corresponding to one channel is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the excitation light corresponding to 8 channels is outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In this instance, as in the case of the above-described (1), the monitoring signal is taken out from the inputted signal light by the branch coupler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the number-of-channel information on the inputted signal light is extracted from the number-of-channel variation notice signal, included in this monitoring signal, by the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and further, this number-of-channel information is inputted to the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A recognizes the number of channels in the inputted signal light on the basis of the aforesaid number-of-channel information to decide whether or not the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo; preset in the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the case that the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A has decided that the number of channels in the signal light to be inputted to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is less than the predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo; (that is, when the number of channels in the signal light decreases to &ldquo;8&rdquo;), the quantity of the excitation light to be supplied to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is controlled as follows (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the variation of excitation light quantities (excitation light powers) from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when the number of channels in signal light decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In the case that the number of channels in the signal light to be inputted to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> decreases from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;8&rdquo;, first, the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B turns OFF the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is controlled not to output excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In this way, as indicated by the reference mark C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the excitation light quantity from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, undergoing only the ON/OFF control decreases gradually, while the excitation light is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, undergoing the level-fixing control, in a quantity determined in consideration of the excitation light quantity to be outputted from the auxiliary excitation light, source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As a result, the excitation light quantity from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> goes to zero, and the excitation light corresponding to 9 channels is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Following this, as in the case of the above-described (1), the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fixes the attenuation factor of the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to conduct the above-mentioned freeze processing for the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. At this time, the reference for the level-fixing control value (the value of the output level of the signal light conforming to the number of channels after decreased) is also updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> controls the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to output the excitation light in a quantity conforming to the number of channels in the signal light after the decrease (the excitation light corresponding to 8 channels). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, when receiving a freeze release signal from the OS side after the completion of the decrease in the number of channels in the signal light, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> returns the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the attenuation factor variable condition, thereby performing the above-mentioned freeze release processing to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Besides, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> completely stops during the guard time S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the first embodiment, since the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned OFF before the number of channels decreases from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;8&rdquo;, it is possible to prevent a lack of the control dynamic range (see the reference mark D in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), which would occur when the output excitation light quantity from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes zero, and, further, to certainly accomplish the excitation light output control (in its turn, the signal light output control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Additionally, because of gradually decreasing the excitation light of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the control of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is followable, and the amplification of the signal light is feasible without adversely affecting the other channels before decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Besides, if the number of channels in signal light decreases but the decrease occurring above 9 channels or the decrease occurring below 8 channels, the ON/OFF control of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a description will be made of the above-mentioned freeze processing and freeze release processing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the interchange of signals at the above-mentioned freeze processing and freeze release processing. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the circled numerals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> represent the interchange of signals in the freeze processing, while the circled numerals <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; designate the interchange of signals in the freeze release processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> First, in conducting the freeze processing, when the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> receives a number-of-channel variation notice signal from the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> decides that the processing of making an increase/decrease in the number of channels in the signal light to be inputted to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is conducted as mentioned above, and thereafter (X1 ms later), the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze ON signal to the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). When receiving this freeze ON signal, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fixes the attenuation factor of the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to perform the freeze processing for the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Further, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze operation flag &ldquo;ON&rdquo; to the MUC <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Incidentally, if difficulty is encountered in outputting the freeze operation flag &ldquo;ON&rdquo;, an alarm is given. Finally, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze state flag &ldquo;ON&rdquo; for informing that the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in the freeze processing conducted condition, with the freeze state flag &ldquo;ON&rdquo; being transmitted through the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the external (the other optical amplifiers or the like in the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Besides, in the case that the number of channels in the signal light decreases from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;8&rdquo;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when receiving the number-of-channel variation notice signal as a trigger, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> turns OFF the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the waiting time (X1 ms) is for freezing the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) connected in the form of multi-stage not simultaneously but in the order from the signal light input side, and different length of time is set to be different at every optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in conducting the freeze release processing, when receiving a freeze release signal from the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;), the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> makes a decision that the control for the presence or absence of the output of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is implemented, and thereafter (X2 ms later), the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze OFF signal to the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;). When receiving this freeze OFF signal, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> returns the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the attenuation factor variable condition, thereby releasing from the freeze processing conducted for the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Further, the ALC <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze operation flag &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; to the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime;). Incidentally, if difficulty is encountered in outputting the freeze operation flag &ldquo;OFF&rdquo;, an alarm is given. Finally, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> outputs a freeze state flag &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; for informing that the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is in the normal condition (that is, it is released from the freeze), with the freeze state flag &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; being transmitted through the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the external (the other optical amplifiers and others in the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Besides; in the case that the number of channels in the signal light increases from &ldquo;8&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when receiving a freeze release signal as a trigger, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> turns ON the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the waiting time (X2 ms) is for releasing the freeze in the order from the signal light input side, and is set to be different at every optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The transmission of the freeze state flags &ldquo;ON&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; to the external is because, in the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, there is a need for a plurality of optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, organizing the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to simultaneously conduct the freeze processing and the freeze release processing, involved with the increase/decrease in the number of channels in signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Still further, in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as a safeguard, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B adjust the level of the output signal light from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in accordance with the connecting condition of the output side end portion of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an illustration of the state transition of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, if the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the step condition, excitation light is not yet outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and when the input recovery of the signal light (concretely, the recovery of an input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) comes about (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), signal light at a low level is outputted from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (preliminary safe optical condition). Besides, at this time, if the input cutoff of the signal light (the cutoff of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) occurs (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to the stop condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the recovery of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> takes place (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), signal light with a level higher than that in the preliminary safe optical condition is outputted from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (safe optical condition). Incidentally, at this time, if the cutoff of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; comes about (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to the preliminary safe optical condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B recognizes the connecting condition of the output side end portion of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (concretely, the connector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) on the basis of the output signal of the reflected light monitoring photodiode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the recognition is made that the connector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>goes into the connecting condition (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> adjusts the quantity of the excitation light to be supplied from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while maintaining the outputting condition of excitation light from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> conforming to the decision result by the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A (that is, if the number of channels in the inputted signal light is &ldquo;9&rdquo; ore more, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON, and when the number of channels in the inputted signal light is &ldquo;8&rdquo; or less, the auxiliary-excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is maintained in the OFF condition), thus setting the level of the output signal light from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to a normal value (normal optical condition). Incidentally, at this time, if recognition is made that the connector <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is released (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B adjust the quantities of the excitation light to be supplied from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (in more detail, placing the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> into the OFF condition), and reduce the level of the output signal light from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to below a predetermined value, thus returning to the aforesaid safe optical condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the cutoff of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; occurs under the aforesaid normal optical condition (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to the preliminary safe optical condition, and if the input cutoff (the cutoff of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) of the signal light occurs under the normal optical condition (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to the stopped condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Besides, if the input cutoff (the cutoff of the input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) of the signal light occurs under the aforesaid safe optical condition (see the circled numeral <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to the stop condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In this way, the level of the output signal light from the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is adjustable in accordance with the connecting condition of the output side end portion of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, so that an appropriate safeguard can be taken in accordance with the condition of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of this invention, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (that is, the excitation light source control section <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>) control the operations of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and therefore, even if the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON/OFF in connection with the increase/decrease in the number of channels in the inputted signal light, it is possible to supply the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with excitation light in a quantity conforming to the number of channels after increased or decreased without exerting adverse influence on the channels being in operation. Accordingly, even if the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in operation, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is capable of stably installing or removing in accordance with an increase/decrease in the number of channels in the signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not incorporated into the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, it is possible to stably operate the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a high speed, and further, to place the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at an arbitrary position (for example, a position remote enough to avoid thermal influence on the other components). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> (c) Description of Modification of First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Although, in the above-described first embodiment, the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> recognizes the number of channels in inputted signal light on the basis of a number-of-channel information, extracted from a number-of-channel variation notice signal included in a monitoring signal, to decide whether or not the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;, it is also appropriate that a decision section of an MCU decides, on the basis of information about an operating condition of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whether or not the number of channels in inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;. The other points are the same as those in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Concretely, a drive current for operating the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used as the information about the operating condition of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, it is also possible that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; is constructed with a hardware and a control signal from the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is inputted through the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; to the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; comprises a plurality of resistors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a plurality of operational amplifiers (OP amplifiers) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a switch (SW) <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, a bidirectional Zener diode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a power source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a voltage clamping diode <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Besides, transistors <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are connected to the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> serves as a buffer amplifier which receives a voltage developing from a drive current flowing through the resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (Vbias) connected to the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is an inverting comparator with a hysteresis and functions as a decision section. Further, the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is an operational amplifier for driving a power transistor and works like the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A description will be given of the control to be executed for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at this time. When a control signal from the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is inputted through the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; to the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a drive current flows through the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby creating a condition that excitation light is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> When the drive current for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is low, the voltage generated by the drive current (Vhigh) is below a threshold of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (Vth, h) (this threshold corresponds to the value of a voltage generated by a drive current for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the number of channels is &ldquo;8&rdquo;), and hence, the output voltage of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> becomes Vhigh (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the switch <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> turns ON, and the input voltage of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is 0V, so that a drive current does not flow through the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> At this time, since the operational amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is subjected to the gain-fixing control by the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, when the number of channels in signal light to be inputted increases, the drive current for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> increases in order to increase the output amount of excitation light from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> If the drive current increases in this way and the voltage generated by the drive current (Vhigh) exceeds the threshold of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (Vth, h), the output voltage of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> becomes Vlow (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the switch <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> takes the OFF condition, and a drive current passes through the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the case of controlling the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in this way, the same advantages as those of the above-described first embodiment are obtainable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> (d) Description of Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Whereas, in the above-described first embodiment, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is not built in the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, an auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; can stably be incorporated into the control loop of an AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; by constructing an optical amplifier as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a construction of an optical amplifier according to a second embodiment of this invention, and the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, is also used as an optical amplifier for amplifying signal light, for example, in the wavelength-multiplexing optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, like the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> This optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the same as that according to the above-described first embodiment, except that an auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided in place of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an MCU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided in place of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, an AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; is used instead of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is incorporated into the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; as mentioned above, a temperature control section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is additionally attached to the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and an output signal from a reflected light monitoring photodiode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A is inputted to the aforesaid control section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the MCU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided with a decision section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A, while the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; is equipped with a control section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This control section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> substantially has the same function as that of the ON/OFF control section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>B in the first embodiment. Further, in the second embodiment, the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; has a primary low-frequency transmission characteristic. Incidentally, this is the most general and basic control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; has one figure smaller ratio between a control gain G<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and a control time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(G<highlight><subscript>{overscore (2)}</subscript></highlight>/&tgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) than the ratio between a control gain G<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a control time constant &tgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of an main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (G<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/&tgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), and its excitation light output quantity is analog-controlled by the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Besides, since this auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is also capable of installing or removing in accordance with an increase/decrease in the number of channels in signal light to be inputted to an optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is indicated with a virtual line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In addition, because of being incorporated into the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is located in the vicinity of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, if an auxiliary excitation light source to be installed is put in the preexisting control loop of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a plurality of stable operating points exist to make the control unstable, but the stabilization of the control becomes possible by determining the control characteristic of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; as mentioned above. In this case, if the control gains are the same (G<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;G<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), a stable control system can be constructed in a manner that the control time constants (&tgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &tgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are varied by one or more figures. Incidentally, an auxiliary excitation light source whose control time constant is set to be infinite is equivalent to the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the above-described first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Besides, the temperature control section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is for controlling the temperature in the vicinity of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, and for example, is constructed with a thermistor and a Peltier device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In this case, since an excitation LD chip forming an excitation light source, normally generates an intense heat and since the operating temperature is required to be around the room temperature (ordinary temperature) for obtaining a high excitation light output, the temperature control section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is driven for executing the temperature control before the light emission of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. At this time, there is need a protection time to be taken until the temperature is controlled to become stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, after the temperatures in the vicinity of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; become stable around the room temperature, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is energized with a drive current to be operated with being incorporated into the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, thereby allowing the construction of a stable control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> With the above-described construction, also in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment of this invention, as in the case of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, the amplification of signal light inputted is achievable, and, when the number of channels in the inputted signal light increases or decreases, the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; are controlled in order to supply the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with excitation light in an amount corresponding to the number of channels after increased or decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In this optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as well as the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, a monitoring signal is separated from inputted signal light by means of a branch coupler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and information on the number of channels in the inputted signal light is extracted from a number-of-channel variation notice signal, included in the monitoring signal, by the SV processing section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and, further, this number-of-channel information is inputted to the decision section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A of the MCU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The decision section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A recognizes the number of channels in the inputted signal light on the basis of the aforesaid number-of-channel information to decide whether or not the number of channels in the inputted signal light is greater than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;, preset within the decision section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In addition, the decision result by the decision section <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A is inputted to the control section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; so that the output quantities of excitation light from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; are controlled by the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime; in accordance with the decision result. In this case, the control for the output quantities of excitation light from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; are done as in the above-described first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> This optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> operates in the same way as that according to the first embodiment at the other points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment of this invention, since the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; can stably be incorporated into the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, as in the case of the above-described optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment, even if the output quantity of excitation light from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is controlled in conjunction with the increase/decrease in the number of channels in the inputted signal light, it is possible to supply the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with the excitation light of an amount corresponding to the number of channels after increased or decreased without exerting adverse influence on the channels being in operation. Accordingly, even though the optical communication system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in operation, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is capable of stably installing or removing in accordance with an increase/decrease in the number of channels in signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Besides, in this optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, since the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; is built in the control loop of the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, it is possible to shorten the above-mentioned guard time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, even in the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment, as in the case of the modification of the first embodiment, it is also appropriate that a decision section of an MCU decides, on the basis of information about an operating condition of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (definitely, a drive current for operating the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), whether or not the number of channels in inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In this case, an MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; can be constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. The MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, substantially has the same construction as that of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. A control signal from the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is also inputted through the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; and, in order for the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to show a slower response as compared with the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a low-pass filter comprising a resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> lies in a control line to the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as the information about the operating condition of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to use information on a leakage light quantity from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or information on the quantity of the excitation light from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> requires the installation of back power monitoring photodiodes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for monitoring the leakage light (back powers) from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, and the installation of excitation light monitoring photodiodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for monitoring the excitation light separated from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. In this instance, the back power monitoring photodiodes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are installed at positions opposite to the light emission ends of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A represents a main excitation light source module made up of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the back power monitoring photodiode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and the numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>A designates an auxiliary excitation light source module composed of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; and the back power monitoring photodiode <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Further, the numerals <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>depict WDM couplers for multiplexing signal light and excitation light, while numerals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote distributing couplers for separating excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In this case, an MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&Prime; is constructed with a hardware as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and a control signal from the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is made to be inputted through the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&Prime; to the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Although the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&Prime; substantially has the same arrangement as that of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, inputted to an operational amplifier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not a voltage generated by a drive current for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as in the case of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, but a voltage generated by a current developing in the back power monitoring photodiodes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or the excitation light monitoring photodiodes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(photocurrent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Like the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, this MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&Prime; is provided with a low-pass filter comprising a resistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> lies in a control line to the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, in order for the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to show a slower response as compared with the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In addition, the control to be executed for the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; at this time are substantially similar to those mentioned before with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> It is naturally possible also in a first modification to employ, as the information about the operating condition of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, information on a leakage light amount from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or information on an excitation light amount distributed from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> (e) Others </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> A description will be made hereinbelow of modifications of the operations of the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the above-described first and second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> (1) Instance of Securing Control Dynamic Range Corresponding to 2 Channels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In this instance, there is a need to use, as the excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a type which outputs, in addition to excitation light corresponding to 9 channels as the expected maximum output, extra excitation light corresponding to 3 channels. That is, in this case, as the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, there is used as a type which is capable of outputting excitation light corresponding to 12 channels in total as the maximum output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference> are illustrations of, in the case that such a main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is put to use, the variations of quantities of excitation light from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when the number of channels in signal light increases and decreases. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, the control dynamic range for 2 channels is designated at a reference mark D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> For the increase in the number of channels in the signal light, when the number of channels in the signal light increases from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;10&rdquo;, only the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is controlled to output excitation light corresponding to 10 channels (see a reference mark A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>), and subsequently, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In this way, as indicated by a reference mark B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the excitation light is gradually outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (or the excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;: same in the following), and the excitation light is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a quantity determined in consideration of the excitation light quantity to be outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Then, finally, the excitation light corresponding to 2 channels is outputted from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while the excitation light corresponding to 8 channels is outputted from the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thus causing the output of the excitation light corresponding to 10 channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, for the decrease in the number of channels in the signal light, when the number of channels in the signal light decreases from &ldquo;10&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo;, the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is first turned OFF before decreasing the number of channels in the signal light. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Each of the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to each of the above-described embodiments is equipped with an amplification optical fiber (a component of the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), which is doped with a rare earth element and receives a plurality of optical signals having different wavelengths, and is constructed to increase or decrease the number of excitation light sources (the number of auxiliary excitation light sources <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;) for supplying excitation light to the amplification optical fiber in accordance with the number of optical signals to be inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, each of the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each of the above-described embodiments are controlled to identify the number of a plurality of optical signals having different wavelengths and to vary the number of excitation light sources (the number of auxiliary excitation light sources <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;) for supplying excitation light to the aforesaid amplification optical fiber in accordance with the number of optical signals identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> (4) Instance that Decision is Made, on the Basis of the Monitoring Result of Power of Inputted Signal Light, as to Whether or not the Number of Channels in Inputted Signal Light is Greater Than a Predetermined Number of Channels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Although, in the description of the first embodiment, the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> recognizes the number of channels in inputted signal light on the basis of number-of-channel information, extracted from a number-of-channel variation notice signal included in a monitoring signal, to decide whether or not the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;, it is also appropriate that a decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A of an MCU decides, on the basis of the monitoring result of power of the inputted signal light, whether the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than the predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo;. Although a monitor for the power of the inputted signal light (that is, a monitor for the power of input &ldquo;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) is omitted from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an input monitor such as a PD provided in the AGC <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can fulfill the function to monitor the power of the inputted signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the power of inputted signal light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, forming a succeeding amplifying section, is controlled to be constant (for example, &minus;12 dBm/ch) at the initial start-up. For instance, in this optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the attenuation factor of the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is controlled so that the power of the inputted signal light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> becomes &minus;12 dBm/ch, that is, when the inputted signal light holds 8 channels, so that the power of the inputted signal light becomes &minus;3 dBm &lsqb;&minus;12&plus;9 &equals;&minus;3 (dBm)&rsqb;. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, because of being congested, the control lines are omitted from the illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The aforesaid value of &minus;12 dBm/ch does not vary in the case of the level-fixing control (ALC control), the gain-fixing control (AGC control) or the increase/decrease in the number of channels in inputted signal light. For this reason, it is also possible that the ON/OFF control of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is carried out by comparing the magnitude of the power of the inputted signal light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> with a predetermined threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the threshold can be set to &minus;3 dBm when the inputted signal light holds 8 channels (in fact, the threshold can be set to a value between the power of the inputted signal light when the number of channels is &ldquo;8&rdquo; and the power of the inputted signal light when the number of channels is &ldquo;9&rdquo;) so that a decision is made to that the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than &ldquo;8&rdquo; when the power of the inputted signal light to the optical amplifying section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> exceeds &minus;3 dBm, thereby making the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> emit light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> In this case, the speed of the increase/decrease in the number of channels is set so that the operations of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are sufficiently followable. In other words, the speed of the ON/OFF control of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is set to be higher than the speed of the increase/decrease in the number of channels (switching speed of the number of channels). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In the case that the number of channels increases to exceed a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo; (for example, in the case that the number of channels changes from &ldquo;4&rdquo; to &ldquo;12&rdquo;), if the speed of turning ON the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is lower than the speed of switching the number of channels, there is a need to increase the number of channels in three steps: from &ldquo;4&rdquo; to &ldquo;8&rdquo;, from &ldquo;8&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo; and from &ldquo;9&rdquo; to &ldquo;12&rdquo;. The above-mentioned manner, by contrast, can offer an advantage in that the number of channels can be increased from &ldquo;4&rdquo; to &ldquo;12&rdquo; at a time because the speed of turning ON the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is higher than the variation of the power of the inputted signal light at the switching of the number of channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In this case, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> are the variations of excitation light quantities (excitation light powers) from the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at the increase in the number in channels in signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Besides, the other points are the same as those in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> (5) Instance that the Number of Channels in Signal Light is Recognized on the Basis of a Number-of-Channel Variation Notice Signal, Included in a Monitoring Signal, and that a Speed of Increase/Decrease in the Number of Channels is Set so that Operations of Main Excitation Light Source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and Auxiliary Excitation Light Source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are Sufficiently Followable </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> That is, even if, like the above-described first embodiment, the decision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>A of the MCU <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> recognizes the number of channels in inputted signal light on the basis of number-of-channel information, extracted from a number-of-channel variation notice signal included in a monitoring signal, to decide whether or not the number of channels in the inputted signal light is more than a predetermined number of channels &ldquo;8&rdquo; and, as described in (4), the speed of the increase/decrease in the number of channels is set so that the operations of the main excitation light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are sufficiently followable (the speed of the ON/OFF control of the auxiliary excitation light source <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is set to be higher than the speed of the increase/decrease in the number of channels), the same advantages as those of the first embodiment and those described in (4) are obtainable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> As described above, in an optical amplifier according to this invention, since the operations of a main excitation light source and an auxiliary excitation light source are controlled by an excitation light source control section, even in the case that the output of excitation light from the auxiliary excitation light source is controlled in connection with an increase/decrease in the number of channels in inputted signal light, excitation light can be supplied to an optical amplifying section by a quantity conforming to the number of channels after increased or decreased without exerting adverse influence on the channels being in operation. Whereupon, even when an optical communication system is in operation, the auxiliary excitation light source is capable of stably installing or removing in accordance with the increase/decrease in the number of channels in the signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, this invention can suitably be used in increasing or decreasing the number of channels in signal light while the optical communication system is in operation, and it is considered that it has an extremely high usability. </paragraph>
