<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to non-volatile resistance variable devices and methods of forming the same. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor fabrication continues to strive to make individual electronic components smaller and smaller, resulting in ever denser integrated circuitry. One type of integrated circuitry comprises memory circuitry where information is stored in the form of binary data. The circuitry can be fabricated such that the data is volatile or non-volatile. Volatile storing memory devices result in loss of data when power is interrupted. Nonvolatile memory circuitry retains the stored data even when power is interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention was principally motivated in making improvements to the design and operation of memory circuitry disclosed in the Kozicki et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,761,115; 5,896,312; 5,914,893; and 6,084,796, which ultimately resulted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/652,706, filed on May 30, 1996, disclosing what is referred to as a programmable metalization cell. Such a cell includes opposing electrodes having an insulating dielectric material received therebetween. Received within the dielectric material is a fast ion conductor material. The resistance of such material can be changed between highly insulative and highly conductive states. In its normal high resistive state, to perform a write operation, a voltage potential is applied to a certain one of the electrodes, with the other of the electrode being held at zero voltage or ground. The electrode having the voltage applied thereto functions as an anode, while the electrode held at zero or ground functions as a cathode. The nature of the fast ion conductor material is such that it undergoes a chemical and structural change at a certain applied voltage. Specifically, at some suitable threshold voltage, plating of metal from metal ions within the material begins to occur on the cathode and grows or progresses through the fast ion conductor toward the other anode electrode. With such voltage continued to be applied, the process continues until a single conductive dendrite or filament extends between the electrodes, effectively interconnecting the top and bottom electrodes to electrically short them together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Once this occurs, dendrite growth stops, and is retained when the voltage potentials are removed. Such can effectively result in the resistance of the mass of fast ion conductor material between electrodes dropping by a factor of 1,000. Such material can be returned to its highly resistive state by reversing the voltage potential between the anode and cathode, whereby the filament disappears. Again, the highly resistive state is maintained once the reverse voltage potentials are removed. Accordingly, such a device can, for example, function as a programmable memory cell of memory circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The preferred resistance variable material received between the electrodes typically and preferably comprises a chalcogenide material having metal ions diffused therein. A specific example is germanium selenide with silver ions. The present method of providing the silver ions within the germanium selenide material is to initially deposit the germanium selenide glass without any silver being received therein. A thin layer of silver is thereafter deposited upon the glass, for example by physical vapor deposition or other technique. An exemplary thickness is 200 Angstroms or less. The layer of silver is irradiated, preferably with electromagnetic energy at a wavelength less than 500 nanometers. The thin nature of the deposited silver enables such energy to pass through the silver to the silver/glass interface effective to break a chalcogenide bond of the chalcogenide material, thereby effecting dissolution of silver into the germanium selenide glass. The applied energy and overlying silver result in the silver migrating into the glass layer such that a homogenous distribution of silver throughout the layer is ultimately achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It can be challenging to etch and to chemical-mechanical polish metal ion containing chalcogenide materials. Accordingly it would be desirable to develop memory cell fabrication methods which avoid one or both of etching or polishing such materials. It would also be desirable to develop alternate methods from that just described which incorporate the metal ions into chalcogenide materials. While the invention was principally motivated in achieving objectives such as these, the invention is in no way so limited. The artisan will appreciate applicability of the invention in other aspects of processing involving chalcogenide materials, with the invention only being limited by the accompanying claims as literally worded and as appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws &ldquo;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&rdquo;(Article <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer fragment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in but one preferred embodiment of a method of forming a non-volatile resistance variable device. By way of example only, example such devices include programmable metalization cells and programmable optical elements of the patents referred to above, further by way of example only, including programmable capacitance elements, programmable resistance elements, programmable antifuses of integrated circuitry and programmable memory cells of memory circuitry. The above patents are herein incorporated by reference. The invention contemplates the fabrication techniques and structure of any existing non-volatile resistance variable device, as well as yet-to-be developed such devices. In the context of this document, the term &ldquo;semiconductor substrate&rdquo; or &ldquo;semiconductive substrate&rdquo; is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material, including, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive materials such as a semiconductive wafer (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials thereon), and semiconductive material layers (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials). The term &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; refers to any supporting structure, including, but not limited to, the semiconductive substrates described above. Also in the context of this document, the term &ldquo;layer&rdquo; encompasses both the singular and the plural unless otherwise indicated. Further, it will be appreciated by the artisan that &ldquo;resistance setable semiconductive material&rdquo; and &ldquo;resistance variable device&rdquo; includes materials and devices wherein a property or properties in addition to resistance is/are also varied. For example, and by way of example only, the material&apos;s capacitance and/or inductance might also be changed in addition to resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor wafer fragment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a bulk monocrystalline semiconductive material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example silicon, having an insulative dielectric layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example silicon dioxide, formed thereover. A conductive electrode material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, also termed a first metal layer, is formed over and on dielectric layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By way of example only, preferred materials include any of those described in the incorporated Kozicki et al. patents referred to above in conjunction with the preferred type of device being fabricated. Layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> might constitute a patterned electrode for the preferred non-volatile resistance variable device being fabricated. Alternately by way of example only, layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> might constitute a patterned line or extension of a field effect transistor gate, with a subsequently deposited layer principally serving essentially as the electrode. An example preferred material for layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is elemental tungsten deposited to an exemplary thickness of from about 100 Angstroms to about 1000 Angstroms. In the illustrated example, layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been patterned, and another dielectric layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has been deposited and planarized as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A second metal layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed (preferably by a blanket deposition) on first metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An exemplary preferred material in conjunction with the non-volatile resistance variable device being fabricated is elemental silver. A preferred thickness for layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is from about 175 Angstroms to about 300 Angstroms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, second metal layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed into a structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and first metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is outwardly exposed. Such is preferably conducted by subtractive patterning of metal layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, for example by photolithographic patterning and etch. In one implementation, structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be considered as comprising a metal mass projecting from underlying substrate material and having outer surfaces comprised of a top surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and opposing side surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which join with top surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at respective angles. The preferred angles are preferably within about 15&deg; of normal, with normal angles being shown in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate on second metal structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outer surfaces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and on exposed first metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such is preferably formed by blanket physical vapor deposition. A preferred deposition thickness for layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably less than three times the thickness of deposited layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, with an example being from about 525 Angstroms to about 900 Angstroms. More preferred is a thickness to provide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at 20% to 50% of layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> thickness. Exemplary preferred chalcogenide materials include those disclosed in the Kozicki et al. patents referred to above. Specific preferred examples include a chalcogenide material having metal ions diffused therein represented by the formula Ge<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>A<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, where &ldquo;A&rdquo; is selected from the group consisting of Se, Te and S and mixtures thereof. The illustrated example provides but one possible example of surrounding the exposed outer surfaces of a projecting metal mass with chalcogenide material in accordance with but one aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, irradiating is conducted through chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to patterned second metal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> effective to break a chalcogenide bond of the chalcogenide material at an interface with the patterned second metal outer surfaces and the chalcogenide material, and to diffuse at least some of second metal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outwardly into the chalcogenide material. Metal doped material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed thereby. Therefore as shown in the preferred embodiment, only a portion of blanket deposited chalcogenide material layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is doped with second metal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A preferred irradiating includes exposure to actinic radiation having a wavelength below 500 nanometers, with radiation exposure at between 404-408 nanometers being a more specific example. A specific example in a suitable UV radiation flood exposure tool is 4.5 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 , </superscript></highlight>15 minutes, 405 nm wavelength, at room ambient temperature and pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the depicted and preferred embodiment, the irradiating diffuses only some of the metal from layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outwardly into chalcogenide material, leaving a remnant structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, the projecting metal mass <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a shape after the irradiating which is maintained in comparison to original shape <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but at a reduced size. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a lesser preferred alternate embodiment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>whereby the irradiating and/or layer dimensions might be modified such that the irradiating diffuses all of projecting metal mass <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outwardly into the chalcogenide material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The preferred exemplary tungsten material of layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not appreciably diffuse into layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and regardless, chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> not doped with metal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is substantially selectively etched from metal doped portion <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the chalcogenide material. In the context of this document, &ldquo;substantially selective&rdquo; means a relative etch ratio of layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> relative to layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or at least 3:1. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment, such etching is preferably conducted to remove all of chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which has not been doped with metal <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The preferred etching comprises dry anisotropic etching, preferably dry plasma anisotropic etching. A principle preferred component of such etching gas comprises CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Additional preferred gases in the chemistry include C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>. Top power is preferably maintained at 500 watts, with the lower wafer susceptor being allowed to float. Susceptor temperature is preferably maintained at about 25&deg; C., and an exemplary reactor pressure is 50 mTorr. By way of example only, a specific example in a reactive ion etcher is CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>at 50 sccm, Ar at 25 sccm, susceptor temperature at 25&deg; C., pressure of 50 mTorr and top power at 500 Watts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been deposited and metal doped chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has been exposed. An example and preferred material for layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is silicon nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an outer conductive electrode layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been deposited and patterned to form the outer electrode of the preferred non-volatile resistance variable device. Example materials include those disclosed in the above Kozicki et al. patents. In the illustrated and described preferred example, silver structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>might be designed and fabricated to constitute the effective quantity of silver for programming the device with no silver being provided in electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Alternately by way of example only, layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> might also constitute elemental silver with no silver being provided in electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Further, by way of example only, electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> might principally comprise elemental silver, or at least a lower silver portion in contact with the chalcogenide material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above-described preferred embodiment example was in conjunction with fabrication of a non-volatile resistance variable device. However, the invention also contemplates metal doping a chalcogenide material independent of the device being fabricated, and in the context of the accompanying claims as literally worded regarding methods of metal doping a chalcogenide material. Further, the preferred example is with respect to formation of a projecting metal from an underlying substrate having chalcogenide material received thereover. However, the invention is in no way so limited and also contemplates, by way of example only, diffusing metal from an entirely flat, or other, underlying surface into overlying chalcogenide material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates non-volatile resistance variable devices independent of the method of manufacture. In one implementation, such a device includes a projecting metal mass (for example mass <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) extending outwardly from a first metal layer laterally central into resistance variable chalcogenide material. In one aspect, the invention contemplates the device being in a highest resistance state for a given ambient temperature and pressure. For example, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> device as depicted is in such a highest state of resistance. Progressively lower states of resistance for a given ambient temperature and pressure will exist as a silver dendrite, in the preferred embodiment, progressively grows from an electrode to the point of contacting the opposing electrode. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts but one exemplary embodiment of such a non-volatile resistance variable device having such a laterally central located projecting mass relative to material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates a non-volatile resistance variable device in a highest resistance state for a given ambient temperature and pressure independent of a conductive projection which is so centrally located. Such comprises a resistance variable chalcogenide material having metal ions diffused therein. Opposing first and second electrodes are received operatively proximate the resistance variable chalcogenide material, with at least one of the electrodes comprising a conductive-projection extending into the resistance variable chalcogenide material. Provision of such a structure is in no way shown or suggested in a highest resistance state for a given ambient temperature and pressure in any of the teachings and drawings of the above, described Kozicki et al. patents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>
