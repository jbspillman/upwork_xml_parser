<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a diagnosis system of an engine, and particularly to a diagnosis system of a hydrocarbon absorbent of the engine having the hydrocarbon absorbent in an exhaust portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a common internal combustion engine, it is typical to install a catalytic converter having a function oxidizing hydrocarbon (HC) as carbon hydride and carbon monoxide (CO) and reducing nitrogen oxide (NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) contained in an exhaust gas discharged from a combustion chamber of the engine, in an exhaust pipe of the engine. The catalytic converter has a property to bring out purifying function of HC, CO and NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>when a temperature of the exhaust gas is higher than or equal to a predetermined temperature but not to sufficiently purify the exhaust gas when the temperature of the exhaust gas is lower than or equal to the predetermined temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in general, since a temperature of the catalytic converter arranged in the foregoing exhaust pipe is equal to an ambient temperature upon starting up of the engine and is lower than the exhaust gas temperature, a purifying performance of the exhaust gas by the catalytic converter is significantly low during a period until the catalytic converter is heated by the exhaust gas to be higher than or equal to the predetermined temperature, at which the catalytic converter is activated, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. In order to solve this problem, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, an exhaust gas purifying system, in which a HC absorbent absorbing HC at low temperature and releasing HC when the temperature becomes higher than or equal to a predetermined temperature Td, is arranged in the exhaust pipe and the released HC is purified by the catalytic converter provided downstream of the HC absorbent or the catalytic converter provided on the same catalyst support with the HC absorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Here, in the exhaust purifying system, in view of the fact that when the absorbing performance of the HC absorbent is degraded in certain cause, HC can be discharged even at low temperature to be a cause of significant degradation of exhaust characteristics, it is required to appropriately detect degradation of absorbing performance of the HC absorbent. Thus, a technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 08-121232 has been proposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 08-121232 is constructed to arrange air/fuel ratio sensors (A/F sensors) linearly detecting an air/fuel ratio on upstream and downstream of the HC absorbent as means for detecting degradation of performance of the HC absorbent for detecting respective outputs of upstream and downstream side air/fuel ratio sensors of the HC absorbent upon release of HC for detecting degradation of performance of the HC absorbent from a difference of detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, since the technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 08-121232 requires two linear air/fuel ratio sensors, a problem is encountered in high production cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the detection method in the foregoing technology utilizes the fact that the downstream side air/fuel ratio is shifted to rich side in the extent of released HC when the upstream side air/fuel ratio is controlled to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, and HC is discharged externally from the exhaust pipe without being purified. This depends on characteristics of the catalytic converter. Namely, in the catalytic converter, by oxidation reduction reaction between HC and CO serving as reducing agents and NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>as oxidizing agent, three components are purified efficiently. Accordingly, it is desirable in view of exhaust optimization to be stoichiometric air/fuel ratio in the condition where amounts of reducing agent and oxidizing agent in the catalytic converter is stoichiometrically balanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows purification performance of the catalytic converter for three components with respect to the air/fuel ratio. In general, by controlling air flow rate or fuel amount to be supplied to the engine, stoichiometric air/fuel ratio can be realized. When a ratio of the air and fuel to be charged into the engine during HC releasing period is controlled to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, reducing agent becomes excessive in the catalytic converter for the amount of HC released from the HC absorbent, namely in rich condition, to be a cause of deterioration of exhaust characteristics of HC and CO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 08-121232 proposes to provide air/fuel ratio sensors (O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor: output characteristics thereof is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) detecting rich or lean with respect to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio arranged upstream and downstream sides of the HC absorbent, in place of the linear air/fuel ratio (A/F sensor: output characteristics thereof is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) and provide means for calculating a correction amount correcting a feedback correction amount for correcting depending upon output of the upstream side air/fuel ratio sensor and a feedback correction amount depending upon the downstream side air/fuel ratio sensor, and means for calculating from the correction amount on the basis of the HC absorbing amount upon release of HC. In this means, in order to indirectly predict HC absorbing amount from the correction amount, it can be said that problem in precision is exist. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Means for Solving the Problem&rsqb;</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an overall construction of an engine control system having the first embodiment of an exhaust device of the engine according to the present invention. An engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is constructed with a plurality of cylinders <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. To each cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, each induction pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In each cylinder <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is mounted. In the induction pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is mounted. On the upstream of the duel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an air cleaner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an air flow sensor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are mounted, and also a throttle valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is arranged. Furthermore, an ISC bypass passage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> bypassing the throttle valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided. In the bypass passage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an ISC valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a hydrocarbon (HC) absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is arranged at an appropriate position. On the downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged. Furthermore, a throttle valve open degree sensor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is arranged in the arrangement position of the throttle valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a coolant temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged on the side of the cylinder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is arranged on a crankshaft portion <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>an A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as an upstream side air/fuel ratio sensor is arranged on upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and an O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a downstream side air/fuel ratio sensor is arranged between the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a control device (control unit) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is arranged. The control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives input of signals of respective sensors, and outputs a control signals to respective operating devices through arithmetic process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Air from outside of the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> passes through an air cleaner <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and flows into a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via the induction pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An intake air flow rate is mainly adjusted by the throttle valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but is adjusted by the ISC valve <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provided in the bypass passage <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for controlling an engine revolution speed by the adjustment. On the other hand, by the air flow sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the intake air flow rate is detected. By the crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a signal is output per 1&deg; of angular displacement of the crankshaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>By the coolant temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a coolant temperature of the engine is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Respective signals of the air flow sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the throttle open degree sensor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> mounted in a portion of the throttle valve <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the coolant temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are fed to the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. From outputs of these sensors, operating condition of the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is obtained for optimally calculating a primary operating amount, such as the basic injection amount of fuel and spark ignition timing. The fuel injection amount calculated by the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is converted into a valve opening pulse signal to be set to a fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the spark ignition timing is calculated to output a drive signal from the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for ignition at the spark ignition timing. The fuel injected from the fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is mixed with the air introduced from the induction pipe <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to flow into the combustion chambers <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of respective cylinders to form a mixture. The mixture is ignited and burnt by spark ignition by the ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. An energy generated at this time becomes a source of power as revolving driving force of the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The exhaust gas after combustion in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fed into the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> absorbs HC under cold condition of the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and releases HC at the temperature high than or equal to the predetermined temperature. The exhaust gas discharged from the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is purified respective exhaust component of HC, CO and NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>by the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is mounted on upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and has a linear output characteristics with respect to oxygen concentration contained in the exhaust gas. A relationship between the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas and the air/fuel ratio is substantially linear asset forth above. Thus, the air/fuel ratio on upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be obtained by the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, on downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted and has a characteristics to output two signals as set forth above and can detect air/fuel ratio downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> derives the air/fuel ratio of upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the signal of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and performs feedback (F/B) control sequentially correcting the basic injection amount so that the air/fuel ratio of the mixture in the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes a target air/fuel ratio. However, as will be discussed later, so that the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes constant upon release of HC, the air/fuel ratio on upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled. On the other hand, when judgment is made that fatigue is caused in the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of a predicted value of the HC absorbing amount indicative of the HC absorbing performance, a fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> as one of fatigue announcing means of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is turned ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the inside of the control unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

After signal processing, such as noise elimination or so forth, by the input circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and then fed to an input/output port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The value of the input/output port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is stored in RAM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is arithmetically processed by CPU <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A control program describing the content of arithmetic process is preliminarily written in ROM <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A value indicative of each actuator operation amount calculated according to the control program is stored in RAM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and then fed to the input/output port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, as an actuation signal of the ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an ON/OFF signal which is turned ON upon power supply for a primary winding in an ignition output circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and OFF while power is not supplied. The signal for the ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> set in the input/output port <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is amplified by the ignition output circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into sufficient energy required for combustion, and is supplied to the ignition plug <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, as the drive signal of the fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an ON/OFF signal which is turned ON upon valve opening and is turned OFF upon valve closing, is set, and is amplified by a fuel injection valve drive circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into a sufficient energy for opening the fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be fed to the fuel injection valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In addition, on the basis of the signal of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on the upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> adapting to various operating condition, environment variation, aging, a HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of performs correction of the air/fuel ratio on upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, in a HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> , on the basis of the signal of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> mounted on the downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> upon releasing of HC, air/fuel ratio correction on the downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is performed. Detailed content of the air/fuel ratio control of upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the air/fuel ratio control of downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be discussed as follow: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At first, concerning content of arithmetic operation of the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient ALPHA by the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the control is for F/B control in on-line for establishing the upstream side air/fuel ratio of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the target air/fuel ratio (TABF&plus;REARHOS) on the basis of an output RABF of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control correction coefficient REARHOS which will be discussed later. Here, TABF is target basis air/fuel ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart of particular arithmetic operation of the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient ALPHA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At first, at step <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> judgment is made whether permitting condition of the F/B control is established or not. As the permitting condition, whether the coolant temperature is higher than or equal to a given value, if not accelerating state, if the sensor is activated and so forth may be considered. Then, when the permitting condition of the F/B control is not established, process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to go to end without performing correction with setting the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient ALPHA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When judgment is made that F/B control permitting condition is established at step <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, namely when YES, PI control is performed on the basis of calculated value DLTABF from the output of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to calculate the correction coefficient ALPHA at steps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> At first, at step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a difference DLTABF of the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio RABF and the target air/fuel ratio (TABF&plus;REARHOS) is calculated. At step <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, a proportional correction term KAMP is calculated by multiplying a proportional gain KP to the difference DLTABF.

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, concerning content of arithmetic operation of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS by the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be discussed with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a HC absorbent temperature predicting means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>predicts a temperature TADSBER of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from various operation parameters of air flowsensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and so forth for setting HC releasing state indicative flag FDESORP is set to 1 by a HC releasing judgment means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when a HC absorbent temperature TADSBER becomes higher than or equal to a HC releasing temperature. Subsequently, when the HC releasing judgment means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>detects end of releasing of HC on the basis of the value of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS, the flag FDESORP is reset to 0. It should be noted that the detail of the content of calculation of the flag FEDSORP will be discussed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the output value of the downstream side air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, in a PI control means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as calculating means for fuel amount to be supplied to the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the engine, from the output value of the downstream side air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, when the flag FDESORP is 1, the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS is calculated through a calculation method discussed later on the basis of an output VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>R of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart of arithmetic operation of the HC releasing state indicative flag FDESORP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, judgment is made where HC releasing is completed or not. Particularly, starting up of the engine, judgment is made whether the flag FDESORP has not yet been reset from 1 to 0 even once or not. If not reset, namely answer is YES, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if NO, the flag FDESORP is reset to o and then the sequence operation goes end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether the temperature of the HC absorbent is reached a releasing temperature or not. Particularly, judgment is made whether the HC absorbent temperature TADSBER becomes higher than or equal to a HC release start temperature TDESORP or not. It should be noted that the HC absorbent temperature TADSBER is a value to be predicted on the basis of a physical model from various operation parameters. Since there are several proposals in connection with detail of the model, detailed discussion will be omitted here. On the other hand, it is also possible to perform actual measurement by mounting a temperature sensor on downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The HC release start temperature TDESORP is preliminarily determined at a value determined from a specification of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Then, when the HC absorbent temperature TADSBER is higher than or equal to the HC release start temperature TDESORP, namely YES, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if NO, the flag FDESORP is set 0, the sequence of operation goes end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether HC releasing is completed or not. Particularly, the value of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS is used. As will be discussed later, during releasing of HC, the air/fuel ratio is controlled to be lean on the upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in order to make the air/fuel ratio on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, the value of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction REARHOS becomes smaller. Accordingly, at step <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS becomes sufficiently small and this condition is maintained for a given period or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Then, if the value of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS is sufficiently small and this condition is maintained for a predetermined period, namely answer at step <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is YES, judgment is made that HC releasing is completed to reset the flag FDESORP to 0 to terminate the sequence of operation. On the other hand, if the answer is NO, judgment is made that HC releasing is on going to set the flag FDESORP to 1 to terminate the sequence of operation. It should be noted that the initial value of the HC releasing start temperature FDESORP is set to 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart of arithmetic operation of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient (correction term) REARHOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is for correction of the upstream side target air/fuel ratio TABF of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the output value of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> falls within a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> At first, at step <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether HC is releasing or not. Particularly, judgment is made whether the flag FDESORP is 1 or not. When the flag FDESORP is 1, namely YES, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if NO, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> to set the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS to 0 to terminate the process without performing correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether the air/fuel ratio on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is rich due to release of HC. Particularly, judgment is made whether the output VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>R of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is greater than or equal to a HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control permitting value (rich side) VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>RMAX or not. If the output is greater than or equal to the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control permitting value VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>RMAX, namely YES, judgment is made that air/fuel ratio on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is rich to advance the process to step <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the output is not greater than or equal to the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control permitting value VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>RMAX at step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the process is advance to step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to check whether the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is less than or equal to a HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control permitting value (lean side) VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>RMIN or not, namely YES, judgment is made that the air/fuel ratio on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is lean and then the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to subtract a variation rate DLL of the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS from the correction coefficient REARHOS calculated in the preceding job to set as the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction REARHOS for making the air/fuel ratio upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rich. Then, a sequence of operation goes end. This is the process to return toward the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio as excessively corrected toward lean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor is not less than or equal to the HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio control permitting value VO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>RMIN as checked at step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to make judgment that the air/fuel ratio downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> falls within the predetermined range, namely close to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to terminate sequence of operation without updating with judgment that the downstream side air/fuel ratio control correction coefficient REARHOS and the downstream side air/fuel ratio control correction coefficient REARHOS calculated in the preceding job are equal. It should be noted that the initial value of the downstream side air/fuel ratio correction coefficient REARHOS is 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Next, prediction of HC amount absorbed by the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and fatigue judgment of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be discussed with reference to FIGS, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Concerning prediction of the HC amount absorbed by the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, since the lean shift amount of the air/fuel ratio upstream of the HC absorbent caused during releasing of HC is correlated to the HC absorbing amount as set forth above, as shown in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, prediction is performed by calculation of the HC absorbing amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> At first, at step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether HC is releasing or not. When the flag FDESORP is 1, namely YES, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for summing integration of a value derived by multiplying air flow rate QA to lean shifting amount from stoichiometric air/fuel ratio on the basis of the upstream air/fuel ratio RABF and the target basic air/fuel ratio TABF to derive a HC absorbing capacity IADSHC as indicia of HC accumulated absorbing amount to terminate operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at step <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, when the flag FDESORP is not 1, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> to make judgment whether fatigue judgment is completed or not. Particularly, judgment is made whether fatigue judgment completion flag FCDIAG is 1 or not. It should be noted that, upon starting up of the engine, the initial value of the fatigue judgment completion flag FCDAG is set to 0. Set condition is discussed later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Then, when the fatigue judgment completion flag FCDIAG is 1 as checked at step <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, namely YES, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to set both of the HC absorbing capacity IADSHC and the HC absorbing capacity calculated in the preceding job to 0 to terminate operation. On the other hand, when the fatigue judgment completion flag FCDIAG is not 1, the process is advanced to step <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> to make judgment that fatigue judgment is not yet performed to maintain the preceding value with judgment that the HC absorbing capacity and the HC absorbing capacity calculated in the preceding job are equal, to terminate the sequence of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flow chart of fatigue judgment of the HC absorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, judgment is made whether HC releasing is completed or not. Particularly, judgment is made whether the HC releasing state indicative flag FDESORP is 0 and the HC releasing start indicative flag FDESORP<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>as calculated in the preceding job is 1 or not. If these conditions are satisfied, namely when YES, judgment is made that HC releasing is completed to advance the process to step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when these conditions are not satisfied, the process goes end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, fatigue judgment of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is performed. Particularly, judgment is made that the HC absorbing capacity IADSHC is less than or equal to a value derived by multiplying a threshold value RAGE of the fatigue judgment preliminarily determined within 0 to 1.0 with respect to the HC absorbing capacity in brand new state and the HC absorbing capacity IADSHCMAX of the HC absorbent in brand new state which is preliminarily and empirically determined, or not. When this condition is satisfied, namely YES, judgment is made that fatigue of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is caused to advance the process to step <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> to turn ON the fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> mounted around the driver&apos;s seat or the like. Process is then advanced to step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to set the fatigue judgment completion flag FCDIAG to 1 and process goes end. On the other hand, when the condition is not satisfied as checked at step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, judgment is made that the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not yet fatigued to advance the process to step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to terminate the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the overall construction of an engine control system having the second embodiment of the diagnosis system for the engine according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing first embodiment is directed to the control system for the engine where the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a catalyst <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the shown embodiment is formed by supporting the HC absorbent and catalytic converter on the same catalyst support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Namely, the shown embodiment of the engine control system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> has the basic construction the same as that first embodiment of the engine control system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but is differentiated from the construction, in which the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided on the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment only at the point where one catalyst <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provided in the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed by supporting the HC absorbent and the catalytic converter on the same catalyst support. Even for the constriction of the shown embodiment, ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the foregoing first embodiment is applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As set forth above, the foregoing embodiment of the present invention achieves the following function by the construction set forth above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the diagnosis system for the engine is the diagnosis system of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which has the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> mounted on the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> detecting the air/fuel ratio of wide range on the upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> detecting rich or lean with respect to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio on downstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and has HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for correcting the air/fuel ratio downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of the output signal of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the HC absorbent upstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for correcting the air/fuel ratio upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of the output signal of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when a predicted temperature of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is higher than or equal to the releasing temperature A for releasing HC, a fuel amount to be supplied to the engine is controlled so that the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> becomes a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to make the output of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as the air/fuel ratio upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> lean to maintain the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the value corresponding to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to prevent deterioration of exhaust. It should be noted that the HC releasing period can be recognized as the period until the output of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> becomes less than or equal to the predetermined value B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Then, the diagnosis system of the engine set forth above includes HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for predicting the HC absorbing amount of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the output signals of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, HC absorbent fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for making judgment of fatigue of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the output signal of the HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for announcing fatigue of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the driver on the-basis of the output signal of the HC absorbent fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The HC absorbent predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> derives the absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of a difference between the output of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio C. The amount for shifting the air/fuel ratio upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> toward lean side is proportional to oxygen amount necessary for oxidizing HC released from the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at that time for capability of prediction of the HC absorbing amount of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the lean shifting amount. Accordingly, the shown embodiment of the diagnosis system of the engine diagnose absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without causing deteriorate exhaust by controlling air/fuel ratio at the inlet of the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to announce to the driver when the fatigue of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is judged and can adapt to restriction under law and regulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, concerning diagnosis performing condition and performing condition of the diagnosis system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the engine, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, it is possible to add a condition that the output of the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor mounted on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by adjusting the output of the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted on upstream side of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, is maintained in richer condition for a predetermined period T, in addition to a temperature condition of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, for making start of releasing of HC clear to enhance accuracy of detection of HC releasing from the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the second embodiment of the diagnosis system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the engine is differentiated from the construction where the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided in the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment at the point where one catalyst <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> installed in the exhaust pipe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports the HC absorbent and the catalytic converter on the same catalyst support. In this case, the air/fuel ratio at the outlet of the catalyst <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is controlled instead of the air/fuel ratio at the inlet of the catalyst <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The first embodiment of ECU <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is applicable to achieve the same effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As set forth above, while the present invention has been discussed in detail in terms of two embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments and various modification in designing is possible without departing from the principle of the present invention as set forth in claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> For example, in the foregoing embodiment, a construction is taken to control the air/fuel ration by air/fuel ratio, it is possible to control air flow rate. On the other hand, the oxygen amount necessary for oxidizing released HC is correlated not only for the air/fuel ratio and air flow rate supplied to the engine. Therefore, HC releasing amount is derived from an integrated value in the releasing period in the value derived by multiplying the lean shifting amount and the air flow rate to improve precision in deriving the HC releasing amount. Furthermore, the HC absorbent temperature predicting means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>predicts a temperature TADSBER of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from various operation parameters, such as the air flow sensor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the crank angle sensor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and so forth. When the sensor for measuring the temperature of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided, it serves as HC absorbent temperature measuring means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the first embodiment, catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, it is also possible to provide NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>catalyst in place of the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Even in this case, similar effect to the first embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the first embodiment has the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on upstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on downstream thereof. However, it is possible to provide either of A/F sensor or O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Even in this case, as will be discussed later, absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the overall construction of the engine control system having the third embodiment of the diagnosis system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the engine. The shown embodiment of the engine control system has the same construction in the basic construction as the first embodiment of the engine control system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. To the point that the air/fuel ratio sensor is provided on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, different from the first embodiment, the air/fuel ratio is controlled on the basis of the output of the air/fuel ratio sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the control system of the diagnosis system of the engine. The diagnosis system of the engine performs prediction of the HC releasing amount upon releasing of HC on the basis of control amount in air/fuel ratio control, and includes HC absorbent downstream side air/fuel ratio correction means <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for correcting the air/fuel ratio downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of the output signal of the air/fuel ratio sensor (A/F sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A or O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B) provided on downstream of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for predicting the HC absorbing amount of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the output signal of the air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A (or <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B), the HC absorbent fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for making judgment of fatigue of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the output signal of the HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> announcing fatigue of HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the basis of the output signal of the HC absorbent fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows diagnosis performing range and performing condition of the diagnosis system for the engine when the air/fuel ratio sensor is the A/F sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A detecting the air/fuel ratio in wide range. When the measured temperature or the predicted temperature of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> becomes higher than or equal to the releasing temperature A for releasing HC, the air amount or fuel amount to be supplied to the engine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is controlled to make air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS lean to maintain the output of the air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A at a value corresponding to stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to prevent deterioration of exhaust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Then, the HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> derives a difference DLTRHOS between the air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS and the fuel injection amount G corresponding to stoichiometric value in each operational range for integrating a value derived by multiplying the difference DLTRHOS with the air amount with respect to the absorbing amount calculation period (T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to derive HC absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. On the basis of the result thereof, the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> diagnose absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to announce to the driver by the fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when fatigue is judged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the diagnosis performing range and performing condition of the diagnosis system for the engine in the case where the air/fuel ratio sensor is the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor detecting rich or lean with respect to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. Even in this case, the air amount or fuel amount is controlled so that the output of the air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B becomes a value corresponding to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to make the air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS by releasing of HC lean and whereby to maintain the output of the air/fuel ratio sensor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B at the value corresponding to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio to prevent deterioration of exhaust. Then, the HC absorbing amount predicting means <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> derives a difference DLTALP of a center value ALPST of the air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS upon non releasing state of HC and a center value ALPLN of the air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS upon releasing state of HC to integrate a value derived by multiplying the difference DLTAP and the air amount with respect to absorbing amount calculation period (T<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and to derive the HC absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. On the basis of the result thereof, absorbing performance of the HC absorbent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is diagnosed by the HC absorbent fatigue judgment means <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to announce to the driver by the fatigue announcing lamp <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when fatigue is judged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the center value ALPST and the center value ALPLN may be replace with an average value of the air/fuel ratio term REARHOS, a value derived by multiplying 1/2 to a sum of the maximum value and minimum value of the air/fuel ratio correction term REARHOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the discussion above, the diagnosis system for the engine according to the present invention can predict HC amount absorbed by the HC absorbent and perform diagnosis of the absorbing performance of the HC absorbent without causing deterioration of exhaust. &lsqb;BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS&rsqb;</paragraph>
