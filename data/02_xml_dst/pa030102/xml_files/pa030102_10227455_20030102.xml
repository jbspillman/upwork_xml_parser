<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention concerns a structural component made of hard material for a wristwatch, characterised in that it includes a hole fitted with an inner threading which is integral with said component, said threading being directly obtained by injection and thus without removing any material of said component for example by machining. </paragraph>

<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a structural component made of hard material for a wristwatch and in particular a middle part for a watch case, a winding crown or bracelet links made of a material having a Vickers hardness greater than or equal to 1100 HV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Metals are very widely used to make external parts for wristwatches because of their very advantageous properties: high mechanical resistance, high level of tenacity, ease of use and machinability, etc. Their hardness is however less than that of ceramics, and experience has shown that external parts for wristwatches have poor resistance to scratches caused by certain very hard agents such as silicon dioxide found in dust, marble or even such. There thus results a relatively rapid deterioration in the aesthetic appearance of these types of parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid these drawbacks, these external parts are currently made of hard metal, for example tungsten carbide, titanium carbonitride or even ceramics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> These materials are however difficult to shape and in particular difficult to machine by means of conventional machining techniques, which constitutes a significant limitation during manufacturing of external parts for the watchmaking industry or jewellery parts whose often complex shapes make the manufacturing cost thereof high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In particular, the assembly of various external parts made of materials of this type, such as for example the assembly of the middle part and the back cover or of the winding crown on its stem, presents significant difficulties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Swiss Patent No. 622 151 discloses an example of an assembly structure of a back cover to a middle part of a watch case made of corundum. The middle part includes a plurality of recesses obtained for example by ultrasonic machining, grinding or electroerosion. These recesses have a flat base and a slightly truncated lateral face and open into the lower face of the middle part. Threaded plugs are glued in the recesses of the middle part. Screws pass through the openings in the back cover and engage in the plugs into which they are screwed. This assembly technique is also used for making ceramic winding crowns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This assembly technique has however numerous drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is very difficult to control the quantity of glue when it is applied into the recesses, given the relatively small gluing surface onto which the plugs are glued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is well known that the film of glue deteriorate quite rapidly over time. This proves particularly inconvenient in the case of a plug glued into the recess of a ceramic winding crown onto which traction efforts are regularly exerted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, the implementation of this assembly technique is all the more delicate the smaller the dimensions. In order to provide an indication, the diameters of the plugs used are of the order of a few millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The main object of the present invention is thus to overcome the drawbacks of the aforementioned prior art, by providing a structural component made of hard material for a wristwatch allowing assembly with other structural components of the same type, which is reliable, simple and economical to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention therefore concerns a structural component made of hard material for a wristwatch, characterised in that it includes a hole whose cylindrical wall includes a threading which is integral with said component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As a result of this new structure, the assembly can easily be achieved by screwing directly into the body of said structural component, which gives it improved reliability. Indeed, thanks to this structural component, it is possible to form an assembly with another component including a positive strong mechanical connection which, in particular, does not involve the phenomenon of adhesion.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will appear in the following description of a preferred embodiment, given by way of non limiting example with reference to the annexed drawings, in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a partial schematic cross-section of a wristwatch fitted with a structural component according to the invention, in particular a winding crown; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-section of the winding crown shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a partial schematic cross-section of a wristwatch fitted with another structural component according to the invention, in particular a middle part of a watch case.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Wristwatch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shown schematically and partially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes a case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed conventionally of a middle part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a crystal <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a back cover <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Watch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes timesetting means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> co-operating in a known manner with a clockwork movement housed in case <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include in particular a winding stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> topped with a winding crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which forms a structural component of wristwatch <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is made of a hard material, i.e. a material having a Vickers hardness greater than or equal to 1100. By way of example, crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made of a &lt;&lt;hard metal&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;metal-ceramic&gt;&gt; or ceramic material. &lt;&lt;Hard metal&gt;&gt; means two phase composite materials formed of a metal phase which covers hard particles such as tungsten carbide particles or the like. &lt;&lt;Metal-ceramic&gt;&gt; means two phase composite materials formed of a metal phase which covers hard particles such as titanium carbonitride or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) includes a hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> whose cylindrical wall includes an inner threading <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is integral with crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and via which the latter is directly screwed onto winding stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. &lt;&lt;A threading integral with a part&gt;&gt; means that threading <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is obtained without removing material by machining using any tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In order to provide an indication, the diameter of crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is comprised between around 2 and 5 mm and the diameter of threaded hole <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is comprised between around 2 and 3 mm, the length of threading <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is comprised between around 1 and 2.5 mm, the manufacturing tolerances of such wristwatch parts being of the order of 2 to 3 hundredths of a millimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> During comparative tests effected by the Applicant, it was observed that crowns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> according to the invention resist traction forces considerably higher than crowns with threaded plugs glued in conformity with the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Typically, the direct mechanical connection between winding stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> resists traction forces of the order of 800 N (breakage of winding stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and more, whatever the environmental conditions whereas the glued mechanical connection between a plug and a crown resists, on average, traction forces of the order of 70 to 100 N in normal conditions, and decreases to 26 N in tropical climatic conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that, if required, a film of glue can be applied onto the threading of stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to block crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on winding stem <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An example of a method for manufacturing a structural component such as ceramic crown <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, will be described hereinafter. One takes first of all a ceramic powder, for example a stabilised zirconium oxide. The powder used has a mean granular size of the order of the micrometer, typically 0.5-1 micrometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The ceramic powder is then mixed with a binding agent, for example a polyvinylic alcohol. The mixture obtained is homogenised and dried, for example in a conventional atomiser. The granule obtained is sieved, typically to 300 micrometers. The sieved granule is then injected into a mould having the shape of the desired crown in order to form a green body of the latter. The mould includes in particular a core having the shape of a cylindrical stem in which helicoid grooves have been made to leave a thread in relief whose external shape corresponds to that of the desired threaded hole. The mould and the core are of course sized to take account of the shrinkage phenomenon which the crown will undergo during the subsequent sintering step. It will be noted in this regard that the dimensions are typically 20 to 25% greater than the final dimensions of the crown. After the injection step, the core is unscrewed then the crown is removed from the mould. The binding agent is then removed by a conventional heat process. After removal of the binding agent, the crown is placed in a sintering furnace in which it is heated at between 1300&deg; C. and 1600&deg; C. for approximately one hour. The crown is removed from the furnace and cooled. The crown is then polished, for example using a diamond paste, so that it has attractive aesthetic aspect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The crown thus obtained may be directly screwed onto a winding stem having a suitable threading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a wristwatch fitted with another structural component according to the invention and wherein the same components as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> bear the same numerical references. In this example, the structural component is formed by middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is made of ceramic material. Middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes, according to the invention, several holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> whose cylindrical wall includes an inner threading <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is integral with the body of middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. These holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> open out into the lower face of middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and directly accommodate screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which pass through openings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in back cover <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to fix the latter to middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to provide an indication, in the case of holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for fixing screws <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of middle part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the threaded diameter thereof is comprised between around 2 and 3 mm, and the length of the threading is comprised between around 2.5 and 5 mm. </paragraph>
