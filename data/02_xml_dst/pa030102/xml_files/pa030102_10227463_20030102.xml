<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component defining, for example, an inductor, an LC component or a feedthrough device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component which provides internal electrodes having increased thicknesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a laminated inductor having a sintered body obtained by integrally firing a metal and ceramic is known. In producing such a laminated inductor, internal electrode paste to define a coil conductor is first printed on a ceramic green sheet. Also, through holes are formed in the ceramic green sheet to electrically connect upper and lower internal electrodes. A plurality of green sheets are stacked to define a laminate body, and the resulting laminate body is pressed in the thickness direction. Then, the laminated structure is fired to obtain a ceramic sintered body, and a pair of external electrodes are formed on the outer surface of the ceramic sintered body to be electrically connected to the coil conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the laminated inductor, the number of stacked ceramic green sheets is increased to increase the number of turns, and thereby produce high inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in the method of printing the internal electrode paste defining a coil conductor on each of the ceramic green sheets, a step between a portion having the internal electrode paste provided therein and a portion without the internal electrode paste in the resultant laminate increases as the number of stacked ceramic green sheets increases. Therefore, in pressing the laminate in the thickness direction before firing, press-bonding distortion occurs. Further, interlaminar peeling referred to as &ldquo;delamination&rdquo; due to the press-bonding distortion after firing also occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the laminated inductance, the thickness or the width of a coil conductor must be increased to decrease DC resistance. However, by the method of forming an internal electrode including the coil conductor by printing the internal electrode paste on the ceramic green sheet, it is difficult to provide an internal electrode having sufficient thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If an internal electrode having sufficient thickness can be provided by repeatedly printing the internal electrode paste several times, the press-bonding distortion significantly increases in pressing the laminate in the thickness direction. Therefore, interlaminar peeling often occurs in the resultant ceramic sintered body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the width of the coil conductor is increased to decrease DC resistance, the inductance value is substantially decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above-described problems occur not only in the laminated inductor but also in other laminated ceramic electronic components. That is, an increase in the number of laminated internal electrodes substantially increases press-bonding distortion when pressing in the thickness direction, thus often causing delamination. Also, an increase in the thickness of the internal electrode to decrease the DC resistance further causes the delamination. </paragraph>

In this step, the green sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are unpatterned ceramic green sheets defining uppermost and lowermost layers of the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are green sheets defining a ceramic layer in which the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided, and the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>, the green sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a composite green sheet including a substantially U-shaped internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defining the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provided around the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The internal electrode defined by an inductance paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is configured to pass through the green sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. In the green sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, space A having a width of about approximately 10 &mgr;m to approximately 25 &mgr;m is provided between the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The space A is formed to ultimately define a space having a width of approximately 1 &mgr;m or less on both sides of the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>, since the space A is provided between the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the green sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is actually supported on a carrier film which will be described below. In laminate, the green sheet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is separated from the carrier film, and then laminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Although the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are arranged with the space A provided therebetween, both layers may be brought into partial contact due to the difficulty in forming both layers to be completely separated from one another with the space A provided therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> plurality of the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are laminated in the same direction. Therefore, a plurality of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are overlapped in the thickness direction to define a thick coil conductor, i.e., an internal electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The green sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes an internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably has a substantially rectangular shape having a short length. The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also configured to pass through the green sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the green sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a space A is also provided between the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The green sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a substantially U-shaped internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to pass through the green sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof, i.e., in substantially the same manner as the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, a plurality of the green sheets <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are laminated in the same direction. Therefore, a plurality of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laminated to define a thick coil conductor, i.e., an internal electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the green sheet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a space A is also provided between the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged to define a connecting internal electrode for electrically connecting the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> laminated in the upper portion, and the internal electrode plate layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> laminated in the lower portion. Therefore, the green sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> defines a connecting electrode green sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are configured to pass through the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively, from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. Therefore, these internal electrode paste layers cannot be formed by coating conductive paste on the green sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, in laminating the green sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the mother carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is prepared. The carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a synthetic resin such as polyethylene terephthalate or other suitable synthetic resin. In this preferred embodiment, the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferably configured to have a substantially square shape, and a printing reference hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided at the approximate center of each of the sides. The carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also includes a lamination reference hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provided near each of the printing reference hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are provided on the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this case, a ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided around the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with a space therebetween (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is schematically shown defining a portion of the coil conductor. The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> corresponds to the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and has a shape corresponding to the planar shape of the intended internal electrode paste layer. After the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided, the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is then provided around the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with a space therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> After the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided, the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is configured with a space from the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As described above, a green sheet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> mother green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as described above is provided to obtain the green sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in each of which the internal electrode paste layer is not provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> lamination stage <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is provided. Then, the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is placed on the lamination stage <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> facing downward. The green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes only ceramic paste and no internal electrode paste layer. In this step, the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned while reading the lamination reference holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with a camera (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Then, the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is press-bonded from the outside of the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and then the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is separated from the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As described above, a plurality of the components in which the green sheet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are repeatedly laminated, and then press-bonded to laminate a plurality of the mother green sheets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, a plurality of the green sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, each of which is supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and includes the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the ceramic paste layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provided with the space therebetween, are laminated by the same method as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In this manner, a plurality of the green sheets are laminated, and the resultant laminate is pressed in the thickness direction to obtain a laminate. The obtained mother laminate is cut in the thickness direction to obtain laminates of respective laminated inductor units. Each of the laminates is fired to obtain the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the green sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are provided to pass through the green sheets from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof, are handled in a state supported by the carrier film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and laminated as described above to easily obtain the laminate to produce the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the laminated inductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this preferred embodiment, the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is easily obtained by integrally firing a laminated ceramic, as described above. The coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are formed to pass through the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively, from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. Furthermore, a plurality of each of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are laminated such that the thick coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is easily obtained. Therefore, greatly improved inductance and current capacity is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the space A is provided on both sides of each of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the space is provided on both sides of the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the resultant ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby further increasing the inductance. As a result, in the laminated inductor obtained by integrally firing the internal electrode and ceramic, residual stress occurs due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the internal electrode and the ceramic, thereby decreasing the initial magnetic permeability (&mgr;i) of magnetic ceramic. The magnetic permeability &mgr;i is represented by &mgr;i&equals;AMs<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/aK<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;b&lgr;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&middot;&sgr;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, A, a and b are constants, Ms represents the saturation magnetic flux density, K<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>represents the crystal magnetic anisotropic constant, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>represents the magnetostrictive constant, and &sgr; represents stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The equation indicates that in order to realize a high initial magnetic permeability &mgr;i, the stress applied to a magnetic material must be minimized. In this preferred embodiment, by providing the space A, the stress applied to the ceramic is substantially decreased to further increase the inductance, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which define the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, preferably have substantially the same thickness as the green sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, respectively, press-bonding distortion is greatly decreased in pressing the mother laminate in the thickness direction. Thus, the occurrence of delamination in the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the first preferred embodiment, a material such as carbon paste or other suitable material, which is scattered during firing, is coated on the upper surface of the uppermost internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In this case, a space is also provided in the upper surface of the uppermost internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to increase the inductance. Similarly, carbon paste or other suitable material may be coated on the lower surface of the lowermost internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> are drawings illustrating the method of producing a laminated inductor according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Although, in the first preferred embodiment, the space A is provided on the sides of the coil conductor, i.e., both sides thereof, a space may be provided above and below the internal electrode in a laminated ceramic electronic component of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the second preferred embodiment, to provide the space above and below the internal electrode, the ceramic green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C are laminated. In fact, green sheets having other internal electrode paste layers provided therein are further laminated above and below the ceramic green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in order to define the coil conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the connecting electrode green sheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> substantially L-shaped carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided, and an internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> defining a connecting electrode is provided at one end of the carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, a ceramic green sheet layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided around the carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the composite green sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided around a substantially L-shaped internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The internal electrode providing the inductance paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has substantially the same shape as the carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and is arranged such that the carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> overlaps the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> when the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are laminated. The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> defining the connecting electrode is arranged to overlap the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the connecting electrode green sheet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C, a</cross-reference> ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is provided around a substantially L-shaped carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and an internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> functioning as a connecting electrode. The carbon paste layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are arranged to overlap the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> when the ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is laminated below the ceramic green sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> overlaps the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at the long side end of the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> when the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are laminated, and the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> overlaps the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at the short side end of the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are arranged to pass through the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, respectively, from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. As a result, these internal electrode-paste layers have a sufficient thickness. Similarly, the carbon paste layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> have a sufficient thickness such that the carbon paste layers pass through the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, respectively, from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the state in which the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are laminated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view taken along line C-C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C. In this laminate, the carbon paste layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are laminated above and below the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to one end of the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the other end of the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the internal electrode defining the inductance paste layers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are further laminated above and below the laminate through the internal electrode plate layers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serving as connecting electrodes to define the same coil conductor as the first preferred embodiment. In the second preferred embodiment, like in the first preferred embodiment, both ends of the coil conductor extend to the ends of the ceramic sintered body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and composite green sheets to define the coil conductor are laminated, and unpatterned ceramic green sheets are laminated at the top and the bottom, followed by pressing in the thickness direction to obtain a laminate defining the laminated inductor of the second preferred embodiment. In obtaining the laminate, the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are configured to pass through the composite green sheets from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. As a result, the thicknesses of the electrode defining portion and the other portion are greatly reduced, thereby decreasing press bonding distortion. Therefore, like in the first preferred embodiment, the occurrence of delamination in the resultant ceramic sintered body is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the laminated inductor of the second preferred embodiment, the carbon paste layers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> are burned out during firing. Therefore, a space is provided above and below the internal electrode defined by compaction of the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Like the first preferred embodiment, the formation of the spaces is effective to greatly increase inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the second preferred embodiment, the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which defines the coil conductor, has a thickness corresponding to the thickness of the green sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, a greatly increased inductance and current capacity is achieved, and the DC resistance is greatly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the second preferred embodiment, as in the first preferred embodiment, a plurality of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which define a portion of the coil conductor, are laminated directly together, and the green sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are laminated to provide the upper and lower spaces to produce a coil conductor having a larger thickness. The inductance is substantially increased via this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Although, in the first preferred embodiment, the space A is provided on both sides of the internal electrode, a space may further be provided above and below the internal electrode according to the second preferred embodiment in combination with the first preferred embodiment. In other words, in the laminated inductor of the first preferred embodiment, like in the second preferred embodiment, the space may be provided above and below the internal electrode, or in the laminated inductor of the second preferred embodiment, like in the first preferred embodiment, the space A may be provided on both sides of the internal electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Although, in the first preferred embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>, the internal electrode paste layer and the ceramic paste layer are configured with the space A provided therebetween, the space between both layers may be filled with a void forming material which burns out during firing. As a void forming material, a carbon paste or synthetic resin used in the second preferred embodiment may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the second preferred embodiment, a synthetic resin other than the material of the carbon paste layer may be used for the void forming material. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of each of the green sheets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are laminated. Therefore, a plurality of each of the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are laminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in laminating the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, one end portion of a upper internal electrode paste layer is brought into contact with one end portion of a lower internal electrode paste layer such that both portions overlap each other on one side. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, of the plurality of the green sheets <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lowermost green sheet <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is laminated on the internal. electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lower green sheet <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> such that both layers overlap each other on one side of a substantially rectangular coil circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Like in the first preferred embodiment, the green sheets <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are stacked, and then pressed in the thickness direction to obtain the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a coil conductor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided. The coil conductor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is made by baking the internal electrode paste layers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to form a coil circuit having a substantially rectangular shape. As described above, the coil conductor of the upper portion and the coil conductor of the lower portion are connected to be directly overlapped in the thickness direction, thereby increasing the reliability of the electric connection between the respective coil conductor portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the laminated inductor of this modified embodiment, a space defined by the space A is provided on both sides of the coil conductor, whereby an increased inductance is obtained as in the first preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing the laminated inductor according to the modified embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a connecting internal electrode paste layer is not necessarily provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the laminated inductor of the modified embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the thickness of the coil conductor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be increased to obtain an increased inductance, and less press-bonding distortion occurs in the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to prevent delamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Although, in the first preferred embodiment and the modified embodiment, a plurality of the internal electrode paste layers having the same pattern are stacked to define the thick coil conductor, an internal electrode paste layer, which defines a portion of the coil conductor, may include a single layer. For example, in the first preferred embodiment, only one each of the green sheets is used such that a coil conductor includes one internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a connecting electrode, and one internal electrode paste layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Even in this case, a coil conductor having substantially the same thickness as the total thickness of the green sheets is obtained. Thus, a thick coil conductor is easily provided, which has lower inductance than the first preferred embodiment and the modified embodiment, but a larger thickness than a conductor formed by the conventional method of coating once on conductive paste on a green sheet. Such a construction may also be included within certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the first preferred embodiment, the external electrodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are provided on the end surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the coil conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is wound from the upper surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the lower surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. However, a so-called transverse coil-type laminated inductor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be provided, in which external electrodes <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided on the end surfaces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a ceramic sintered body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a coil conductor is wound from the end surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the end surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Although, in the first preferred embodiment and the modified embodiment, the method of producing the laminated inductor is described, the present invention can also be used for producing not only the laminated inductor but also other laminated ceramic electronic components such as a laminated varistor, a laminated thermistor, a laminated capacitor, and other suitable components. More specifically, by producing each of various laminated ceramic electronic components, press-bonding distortion is greatly decreased in pressing a laminate in the thickness direction before firing, thereby obtaining a laminated ceramic electronic component causing less delamination and having excellent reliability. Also, the thickness of the internal electrode is substantially increased to permit a greatly increased inductance and current capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, a green sheet is provided, in which an internal electrode paste layer is provided in the internal electrode forming portion, and a ceramic paste layer is provided in the other portion. More specifically, an internal electrode is configured to pass through the green sheet from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof, and when a laminate obtained by stacking a plurality of the green sheets is burned to obtain a ceramic sintered body, the thickness of the internal electrode is substantially increased as compared with a conventional laminated ceramic electronic component including an internal electrode formed by printing conductive paste on each of green sheets. Therefore, inductance and a current capacity are substantially increased, and DC resistance greatly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In addition, a space is provided on both sides of the internal electrode to further increase the inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the green sheet, the portion where the internal electrode is provided and the ceramic paste layer have the same thickness, thereby causing less press-bonding distortion when the laminate is pressed in the thickness direction before firing. Therefore, in the laminated ceramic electronic component, the occurrence of delamination is effectively prevented, thereby obtaining a laminated ceramic electronic component having excellent reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The ceramic paste printing step may be performed before or after the internal electrode paste printing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the production method of preferred embodiments of the present invention, when the step of press-bonding the green sheet supported by the carrier film, and then separating the carrier film is repeated several times for the same green sheets, an internal electrode having a larger thickness is provided, in which a plurality of internal electrode paste layers are laminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, first and second composite sheets supported by carrier films are prepared, each of which includes an internal electrode configured to pass through a ceramic green sheet from one of both main surfaces to the other, and the ceramic green sheet. The first composite sheet is press-bonded, the carrier film is separated, the second composite sheet is laminated on the first composite sheet, and then press-bonded, and then the carrier film of the second composite sheet is separated to form an internal electrode by lamination of the internal electrode layers of the first and second composite sheets. Therefore, an internal electrode having a substantially increased thickness is provided, thereby greatly decreasing DC resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In addition, a space is provided on both sides of the internal electrode to obtain an increased inductance. Furthermore, in the laminate obtained in the lamination step, the portion where the internal electrode is provided, and the other portion have substantially the same thickness, thereby causing much less press-bonding distortion when the laminate is pressed in the thickness direction before firing. Therefore, a laminated ceramic electronic component causing much less delamination and having excellent reliability is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with a third preferred embodiment of the present invention, an electrode green sheet defined by a carrier film and including an internal inductance electrode configured to pass through the green sheet from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof, and a connecting electrode green sheet supported on a carrier film and including a connecting electrode configured to be exposed from the upper and lower surfaces of the green sheet are provided. A plurality of the internal electrodes for inductance are electrically connected through the connecting electrodes to define a coil conductor. Therefore, as in the first and second preferred embodiment of the present invention, the internal inductance electrode is configured to pass through each of the green sheets from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. Therefore, the thickness of the coil conductor is increased to substantially decrease the DC resistance, and thus, a high inductance is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In addition, a space is provided on both sides of the coil conductor to further increase the inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the green sheet, the portion where the internal electrode is provided and the other portion have substantially the same thickness, thereby producing less press-bonding distortion when the laminate is pressed in the thickness direction before firing. Therefore, a laminated ceramic electronic component producing less delamination and having outstanding reliability is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a plurality of green sheets having the internal inductance electrodes having substantially the same shape are laminated, an internal electrode including a plurality of layers is provided to produce a laminated inductor having substantially increased inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, by press-bonding the electrode green sheet and the connecting electrode green sheet, and then separating the carrier films, a composite sheet including the internal electrode and the connecting electrode, and handling of the ceramic layer is greatly facilitated, thereby permitting stable lamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of electrode green sheets each including a ceramic layer provided around an internal inductance electrode are laminated to obtain a laminate in which the internal electrodes are electrically connected to define a coil conductor. Therefore, as in the first to third preferred embodiment of the present invention, a thick internal electrode, i.e., a thick coil conductor, is provided, thereby decreasing DC resistance, and obtaining an increased inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the step of pressing in the thickness direction before firing, a substantially decreased amount of press-bonding distortion occurs, and thus a laminated inductor producing much less delamination and having excellent reliability is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, the carrier film is separated after each of the electrode green sheets is press-bonded, and thus the electrode green sheets are easily handled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a plurality of the electrode green sheets including the internal inductance electrodes having the same shape are laminated directly, an internal inductance electrode including a plurality of layers is provided to further increase the thickness of the coil conductor, whereby higher inductance is easily obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a space is formed on both sides of the coil conductor to further increase the inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In the first to fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a space is filled with a void forming material in the unburned step to form the space, the space is not formed in a laminate state, and thus the laminate is compacted by pressing, thereby finally obtaining a compact sintered body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> When using carbon paste or a synthetic resin as the void forming material, the material is burned down in firing the ceramic to securely form the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention, a void forming green sheet is laminated on a composite green sheet, and thus a void forming material is burned down to define a space above and/or below an internal electrode in the final resultant sintered body. Therefore, for example, in producing a laminated inductor, a greatly increased inductance is obtained. In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention, an internal electrode paste layer is configured to pass through a composite green sheet from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof, and thus an internal electrode having an increased thickness is obtained to substantially decrease DC resistance, and greatly increase inductance and a current capacity. In addition, less press-bonding distortion occurs in press bonding after lamination, and thus a laminated inductor having greatly decreased delamination and having excellent reliability is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the method of producing a laminated ceramic electronic component in accordance with the sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention, a composite green sheet is provided, in which an internal inductance electrode is provided to pass through the green sheet from the upper surface to the lower surface thereof. Therefore, the thickness of the internal electrode for inductance is increased to substantially decrease the DC resistance, and obtain substantially increased inductance and current capacity. In addition, a connecting electrode green sheet having a void forming material layer is laminated to overlap the internal inductance electrode such that a space is provided in contact with at least one of the upper and lower surfaces of the internal electrode for inductance in the final resultant sintered body. Therefore, the formation of the space is achieved having an increased inductance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the production method in the sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention, greatly reduced press-bonding distortion occurs in pressing the laminate, and thus greatly reduced delamination occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a laminated inductor having outstanding reliability and increased inductance is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> If carbon paste or a synthetic resin is used as the void forming material, the material is easily burned down in firing ceramic to securely provide the space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In a laminated ceramic electronic component of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an internal electrode provided in a ceramic sintered body has a thickness corresponding to the total thickness of a plurality of ceramic layers, thereby increasing the inductance and current capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> When a plurality of internal electrodes are electrically connected directly with each other in a ceramic sintered body, only a green sheet including an internal electrode provided therein is provided, thereby obtaining a laminated ceramic electronic component having substantially increased inductance and current capacity and reduced DC resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the laminated ceramic electronic component of the present invention, when a plurality of internal electrodes are electrically connected through connecting internal electrodes, coil conductors having various coil patterns are effectively provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it is to be understood that modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
