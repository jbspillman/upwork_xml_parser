<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to semiconductor fabrication methods and apparatus for implementing such methods. More particularly, the present invention relates to metal oxide gate structures for semiconductor devices, e.g., MOSFET devices, memory devices, etc., and other structures including metal oxide dielectric material. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices such as field effect transistors are commonly used in the electronics industry. Such devices may be formed with extremely small dimensions, such that thousands or even millions of these devices may be formed on a single crystal silicon substrate or &ldquo;chip&rdquo; and interconnected to perform useful functions in an integrated circuit such as a microprocessor, a memory device, etc. For example, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are widely used in memory devices that comprise an array of memory cells that include field effect transistors and capacitive structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although transistor design and fabrication are generally complex, a simplified field effect transistor is described below. In such a field effect transistor, a portion of a substrate near the surface is designated as a channel of the transistor. The channel is electrically connected to a source and a drain such that when a voltage difference exists between the source and the drain, current will tend to flow through the channel. The semiconducting characteristics of the channel are altered such that its resistivity may be controlled by the voltage applied to a gate, which generally includes a conductive layer or gate electrode overlying the channel. By changing the voltage on the gate, more or less current can be made to flow through the channel. The gate electrode and the channel are separated by a gate dielectric. Generally, the gate dielectric is insulating, such that between the gate and channel little or no current flows during operation, although tunneling current is observed within certain dielectrics. The gate dielectric allows the gate voltage to induce an electric field in the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, integrated circuit performance may be enhanced by scaling. In other words, performance and density are enhanced by decreasing the size of the individual semiconductor devices on the chip. This has been accomplished by decreasing the thickness of the gate dielectric, thus bringing the gate in closer proximity to the channel. As modem silicon device size becomes smaller or has been scaled to smaller and smaller dimensions, with a corresponding size reduction of the gate length of MOS devices, the gate dielectric thickness has continued to decrease, for example, to less than 2 nm (20 &angst;) and as thin as 1 nm (10 &angst;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the most commonly used gate dielectric material, silicon dioxide, exhibits high leakage current density in this thickness range because of direct band-to-band tunneling current or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling current. Further, because such silicon dioxide layers are formed from a few layers of atoms, complex process control is required to repeatably produce such silicon dioxide layers. Further, uniformity of coverage is also critical because device parameters may change dramatically based on the presence or absence of even a single monolayer of dielectric material. Because of the limitations of silicon dioxide, alternative high dielectric constant (K) films such as TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and other high dielectric films have received a lot of interest as substitutions for very thin silicon dioxide gate dielectrics. Such alternate dielectric materials can be formed in a thicker layer than silicon dioxide and yet still produce the same field effect performance. Such performance is often expressed as &ldquo;equivalent oxide thickness.&rdquo; In other words, although the alternate material layer may be thick, it has the equivalent effect of a much thinner layer of silicon dioxide. Most of the interest in alternate materials for silicon dioxide have employed the use of metal oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Various methods have been described for the formation of metal oxides, e.g., formation of metal oxide gate dielectrics. For example, in Haraguchi et al., &ldquo;A TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>Gate Insulator of a 1-nm Equivalent Oxide Thickness Deposited by Electron-Beam Evaporation,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Extended Abstracts of </italic></highlight>1999 <highlight><italic>International Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials</italic></highlight>, pps. 376-377 (1999), fabrication of thin dielectric films by electron beam evaporation was described. As described in Haraguchi et al., one of the more common methods of forming metal oxide films, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), is by chemical vapor deposition. However, for example, impurities such as carbon and chlorine originating from titanium precursors in such chemical vapor deposition processes may cause undesirable influence on the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film properties. To achieve the preparation of high purity TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films, electron beam evaporation (as described in Haraguchi et al.) has been used instead of chemical vapor deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, as described in Haraguchi et al., electron beam evaporation for forming metal oxides was performed in the ambient of ozone plasma minimizing the effect of oxygen depletion, resulting in pure TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films. Further, by optimizing TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>deposition thickness and TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>annealing conditions, TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films with 1 nm equivalent oxide thickness which showed low leakage current and interface trap density were realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, even though electron beam evaporation methods have been found to produce metal oxides which show low leakage current and have suitable equivalent oxide thickness, optimization of such film formation processes are necessary. The optical properties for most vacuum evaporated thin films change when the films are exposed to moisture, and they are unstable in air since the properties are dependent on the relative humidity. Such properties are attributed to microstructure of the films, which have been reported to include approximately cylindrical columns several tens of nanometers in diameter with voids between them. As a result, the density of the films is less than that of the bulk material. Upon contact with the moisture, the internal surfaces of the columns adsorb a monolayer of water. On exposure to a humid atmosphere, the voids act as capillaries and fill with water, upon bringing the relative humidity above a certain threshold, which depends upon the diameter of the pores. Consequently, the refractive indices of the films when deposited are less than those of the bulk material and change when the film is exposed to a humid atmosphere. The extent of the change is dependent upon the relative humidity. Typical packing densities for such films have been found to be between 0.75 to 1.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Higher packing densities for films and, hence, increased stability were reported to be achieved as described in an article by Martin et al., &ldquo;Ion-beam-assisted deposition of thin films,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Applied Optics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 22, No. 1 (Jan. 1, 1983), where the adatoms had greater mobility on the substrate surface. The article indicates they can be produced by heating a substrate or by increasing the energy of the arriving atoms or molecules as occurs in sputtering or ion beam deposition. Additional activation energy can be added to the growing film if it is bombarded with low energy ions during deposition, as reported therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In addition, an article by Souche et al., entitled &ldquo;Visible and infrared ellipsometry study of ion assisted SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Thin Solid Films</italic></highlight>, Vol. 313-314, pps. 676-681 (1998), described the study of oxygen ion-assisted silica thin films by means of in situ visible spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry in air. The article discusses the transition from porous evaporated films to compact films, with emphasis on compaction of silicon dioxide films by ion-assisted deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, ion-assisted deposition of silver thin films was described in an article by Lee et al., entitled &ldquo;Ion-assisted deposition of silver thin films,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Thin Solid Films</italic></highlight>, Vol. 359, pps. 95-97 (2000). The article describes silver films deposited with ion bombardment which are more durable in a humid environment and maintain a higher value of reflectance over time than those deposited without ion bombardment. The effects of ion bombardment was found to reduce the surface roughness and increase the film density. Further, the hardness of the films increased. Yet further, the article described the finding that lattice spacing increased. </paragraph>

For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, three layers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed and thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the gate dielectric and the multiple conductive layers <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are patterned resulting in gate dielectric <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and gate electrode layers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to form the gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Various techniques for patterning the layers, e.g., removing unmasked regions, are know to those skilled in the art and the present invention is not limited to any particular technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As known to one skilled in the art, in a field effect transistor, a portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> near the surface is designated as a channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> during processing. Channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to source/drain <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> such that when a voltage difference exists between the source/drain, current will tend to flow through the channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The semiconducting characteristics of channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are altered such that its resistivity may be controlled by the voltage applied to gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, by changing the voltage on gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, more or less current can be made to flow through channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The conductive gate components <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are separated by gate dielectric <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The metal oxide gate dielectric <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is insulative such that between the conductive gate components <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> little or no current flows during operation. However, the metal oxide gate dielectric <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> allows the gate voltage to induce an electric field in channel <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. After formation of the gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, various processing techniques, such as, for example, metalization techniques used for providing electrical connection to the source/drain <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, are used to complete formation of, for example, the complete transistor device, interconnect levels, memory device structures including capacitive structures formed thereafter, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It will be readily apparent that the present invention is focused on the formation of the metal oxide gate dielectric <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the other steps utilized therewith may be those known to one skilled in the art. For example, various manners of doping the source and drain may be used, one or more layers may be used for formation of the conductive gate electrode portion of gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (e.g., polycide structures, silicide layers, etc.), various silicidation processes or salicidation may be used for metalization of the various regions, etc., without limiting the process of forming the metal oxide gate electrode <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For simplicity purposes, the remainder of the description below shall be limited to the formation of the metal oxide <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, with the metal oxide <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> preferably being TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Generally, the present invention forms TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by electron beam evaporation from a TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source, e.g., high purity TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>slug, in a vacuum chamber in the presence of an ion beam. Preferably, the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is formed on a heated substrate assembly, and also in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere, e.g., O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or ozone. The presence of an ion beam during deposition of the metal oxide by evaporation enhances the packing density and makes the metal oxide more reliable in terms of dielectric breakdown and reducing tunneling current. The metal oxide film produced provides an adequate equivalent oxide thickness, with the metal oxide thickness of the material formed being in the range of about 50 &angst; to about 500 &angst;. Since tunneling currents are exponential functions of electric fields, the thicker films of TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will result in much lower electric fields and insignificant tunneling currents when compared to the use of silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The formation of TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>according to the present invention shall be further described with reference to the metal oxide evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The metal oxide evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which a substrate assembly, e.g., wafer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, is positioned and held by substrate holder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The substrate assembly, e.g., wafer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, may be any substrate assembly as previously described herein and it may be held in the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by any suitable substrate holder, e.g., electrical or mechanical coupling structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The metal oxide evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a heater apparatus <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for heating the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as the metal oxide <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed. The evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in which a stream of electrons is accelerated to a high energy and directed at source material <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to be evaporated. The electron stream melts and evaporates the material <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for deposition of the metal oxide on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, the evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and ozonizer apparatus <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> provides for the generation of an ion beam using an inert gas to provide inert gas ions for contacting, e.g., such as for compacting, the metal oxide during formation thereof. The ozonizer apparatus <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> compensates for the loss of oxygen in the deposited TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further, included in the metal oxide evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is a shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, e.g., a mechanical shutter, located between the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In addition, a monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, e.g., a quartz crystal thickness monitor, is further provided as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The heater apparatus <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be any apparatus suitable for heating the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Preferably, for the formation of TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the substrate assembly temperature is between about 100&deg; C. to about 150&deg; C. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one suitable embodiment of the heater apparatus <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a heating element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> surrounded by a heat reflector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for reflecting heat to the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> generally includes an electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for generating an electron beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> directed at an evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to melt evaporant material thereof. Generally, the electron beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can melt and evaporate material of source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, provided the beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can supply energy to the evaporant at an equal or greater rate than the rate at which heat is lost as the material is held at high temperature. Electron beam guns are available that supply up to 10 kilowatts of highly concentrated electron beam power for evaporation applications. Very high film deposition rates can thereby be attained as a result of the high power available. The electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> further includes a controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, shown generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for controlling operation of the electron gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and evaporation process. Preferably, the controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> adjusts the electron gun power such that the gun will yield a deposition rate of about 0.1 nm/sec to 1.0 nm/sec when used in forming metal oxides according to the present invention, particularly with respect to TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The beam energy is concentrated on the surface of the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and thus, a molten region can be supported by a cooled structure. The target material, or evaporant source itself, typically provides a solid layer that separates the molten portion of the evaporant material from a holder, e.g., a crucible, that is cooled. This eliminates the problem of reaction with or dissolution of the holder by the melt and allows highly pure films to be deposited. This holder is typically copper, which has a high melting temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes high purity metal oxide. As used herein, high purity metal oxide refers to a metal oxide having a purity that is about 99.999% or greater. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> includes TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>that is greater than about 99.999% pure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is generally a self-accelerating, 270&deg; beam gun that is generally a standard design and commonly available. In such guns, a magnetic field simultaneously bends the beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to 270&deg; and focuses the beam on the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The electron emission surface is hidden from the evaporating source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the substrates are also protected from contamination by material evaporating from the heated filament of the gun. Movement of the beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which allows the evaporant source to be scanned, may be accomplished by electromagnetic deflection. This avoids the problem of non-uniform deposition that may be caused by the formation of a cavity in the molten evaporant source if the beam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> were stationary. Although various preferred parameters are given for the electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as described above, any suitable electron beam gun may be used according to the present invention, e.g., a Temescal electron beam gun). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which provides for bombardment of the substrate assembly surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> uniformly during metal oxide formation includes an ion gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an ion gas source <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and an ion beam controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> provides for compacting of the metal oxide formed on the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The ion gas source <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be any inert gas. As referred to herein, inert means any gas that is nonreactive with the materials being deposited. Preferably, the ion gas source includes at least one of argon, xenon, and krypton. More preferably, the ion gas source is argon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The ion gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be any suitable type of ion gun that provides for compaction of the metal oxide being formed, such as a Kaufman-type ion gun. Ion guns are commonly available, such as those available from Applied Materials, Inc. Preferably, the ion beam incident angle (&agr;) is within the range of &plus;40 degrees to about &minus;40 degrees relative to the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Further preferably, the ion beam gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is an ion gun with a fairly large diameter. Preferably, the diameter is in the range of 7.6 cm to 10 cm. Yet further, the ion gun is preferably a filament-type gun which uses a hot filament to ionize the gas from gas source <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A filament-type ion gun is preferred over a cold catheter discharge ion gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The ion beam gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is controlled by controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to produce an ion beam density for bombardment of the material being formed on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the ion beam density is in the range of about 0.5 ma/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to about 1.0 ma/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. An ion beam density in this range is generally required to obtain a suitable degree of compaction by the bombardment of ions on substrate assembly surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as the metal oxide is being formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition to the use of the electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the formation of metal oxide on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> mounted in the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the ozonizer apparatus <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> provides the necessary oxygen to compensate for any loss of oxygen in the evaporated metal oxide. The ozonizer apparatus <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, includes the ozonizer structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for providing ozone into the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from the ozone source <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> under the control of controller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Although the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be flooded with oxygen, e.g., O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the ozonizer structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is preferably adapted to direct ozone towards the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> upon which the metal oxide is deposited. This maintains the ozone in the region of formation of the metal oxide on the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and provides for uniform distribution of ozone in this region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferably, according to the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the ozonizer structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes a ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> with center axis <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> therethrough. The ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> adapted to direct ozone towards the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> having the openings <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> enhance the uniform distribution of ozone in the region of the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The ozonizer ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is positioned generally parallel with the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, e.g., semiconductor wafer, with the openings <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> adapted for directing ozone towards the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The ozonizer ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is generally of a size that does not inhibit the ion beam generated by the ion beam gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from bombardment of the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as the metal oxide is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The metal oxide evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes a shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, e.g., a mechanical shutter, located between the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is employed to prevent contaminants absorbed on the evaporant source surface from being incorporated into deposited metal oxide. In other words, if the vacuum chamber and the evaporant source are exposed to ambient conditions in the loading and unloading of substrate assemblies, e.g., wafers, some contamination may occur on the evaporant source. Therefore, when the source is initially heated, such surface contaminants may vaporize together with source material and, as such, contaminate the metal oxide formed on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. By interposing the shutter between the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and postponing formation of the metal oxide until the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is sufficiently clean, the purity of the formed metal oxide can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Further included in the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which monitors the metal oxide thickness being formed on substrate surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Further, incorporation of oxygen in the film may also be monitored. Various types of monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be used, such as a quartz crystal thickness monitor or an oxygen pressure monitor for monitoring oxygen incorporation. Such monitoring may provide information to one or more of the controllers of the system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, the concentration of ozone in the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be controlled by monitoring the oxygen content in the film using monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and adjusting, via controller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the ozone in the region proximate the surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the deposition rate may be adjusted under control of controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as a result of information available from monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> concerning the thickness of the metal oxide being formed on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Although several monitoring devices are described above, the present invention is not limited to those listed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Generally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes an elongated chamber space extending between a first end <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> along axis <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is centrally located toward the bottom or second end <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The substrate assembly holder <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which holds the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is surrounded by the heater apparatus <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Proximate the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is the ozonizer ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> with the small openings <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> directed to the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for uniform distribution of ozone, particularly to compensate for loss of oxygen in an evaporated TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film. The shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located between the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the ozonizer ring <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The ion beam gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is located generally towards the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> relative to the ion electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and slightly off axis from the center location of the electron beam gun <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Generally, the method of forming metal oxide using, for example, the evaporation system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shall be described below. The description of the formation method below is provided with respect to TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>formation, however, the general concepts employed in the formation method are applicable to the other high dielectric constant materials as listed previously herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is pumped down to a pressure in the range of about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>torr to about 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>torr as generally represented by arrow <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The heater apparatus <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is controlled to provide a deposition temperature of about 100&deg; C. to about 150&deg; C. The evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a high purity TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>slug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> initializes the evaporation process. Although the ion beam gun <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be initiated by controller <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> simultaneously with the electron beam evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, preferably, the introduction of the ion beam used to bombard the substrate assembly surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> during the metal oxide formation from the evaporation of the evaporant source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is delayed for a predetermined period of time to allow deposition of at least one monolayer of the metal oxide, e.g., TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. This provides protection in the case of a silicon substrate surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> from possible damage caused by the ion beam bombardment. Preferably, the electron beam gun power is adjusted such that the gun will yield a deposition rate of about 0.1 nm/sec to 1.0 nm/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, preferably, the ion beam apparatus <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> provides an argon ion beam density in the range of about 0.5 ma/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 1 ma/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. However, as described above, preferably, the ion beam is delayed following initialization of the evaporation apparatus for a period of time, e.g., approximately 1-2 seconds, to allow deposition of at least one monolayer of TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Further, upon initialization of the evaporation apparatus <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a pre-evaporation phase is completed during which shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is closed, preventing formation of metal oxide on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. During the pre-evaporation phase, outgasses resulting from evaporation during the pre-evaporation phase are exhausted, as is generally represented by arrow <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. As such, contaminants which potentially may contaminate the metal oxide film being formed are removed during the pre-evaporation phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Following the pre-evaporation phase, the shutter <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is opened to allow formation of the metal oxide on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Preferably, only after at least a monolayer of TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is formed is the argon beam initiated to provide for compaction during the remaining formation of the TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> During formation of the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the partial pressure of ozone provided by the ozonizer apparatus <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in the range of about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>torr about 8&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>torr. The optimum parameters for the ozone in the region proximate the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is or may be determined by monitoring the oxygen content in the metal oxide being formed as represented generally by the monitoring apparatus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Use of the ion bombardment of the substrate assembly surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> uniformly during metal oxide formation will provide a desirable compact metal oxide. Preferably, in the case of a TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate dielectric, the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>thickness is in the range as described previously herein with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C. Typical packing densities for the metal oxide are preferably in the range of about 0.9 to about 1.0. In other words, the ratio of a metal oxide film deposited without the use of ion bombardment versus a metal oxide film deposited using ion bombardment is in the range of about 0.9 to about 1.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that various commercial components such as electron beam guns and ion beam guns are available for use and modification according to the present invention. All patents and/or references cited herein are incorporated in their entirety as if each were incorporated separately. This invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments and is not to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the illustrative embodiments, as well as additional embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to this description.
