<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A hot-pluggable disk drive is supported on a carrier structure that is slidably and removably insertable rearwardly into a sheet metal cage portion of a computer system to releasably couple an SCA connector on the rear end of the drive to a corresponding electrical connector on a backplane structure within a rear interior portion of the cage. The carrier structure includes a base wall upon which the disk drive rests, and a pair of transverse side walls disposed on opposite side edge portions of the base wall. To substantially reduce self-induced, performance degrading operational vibration of the inserted drive about the rotational axis of its platter section, outward projections are formed on the opposite side wall portions of the carrier in a forwardly offset relationship with the rotational axis of the drive. As the drive is inserted into the cage, these projections slidingly engage and form an interference fit with inwardly bent opposing side wall portions of the cage. This interference fit between the carrier and the cage substantially reduces the performance degrading vibration about its rotational axis that the disk drive is capable of generating during its operation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to the mounting and support of hard disk drives for computers and, in a preferred embodiment thereof, more particularly relates to apparatus for removably supporting a plurality of hot plug-connected hard disk drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hard disk drives for a file server or other type of computer are often mounted, in a vertically or horizontally stacked array, in a rectangular sheet metal &ldquo;cage&rdquo; structure which may be disposed within the computer housing or externally thereto. For operational convenience and flexibility, each disk drive is typically &ldquo;hot plug&rdquo; connected within the cage. This type of electrical connection permits any of the supported disk drives to be removed and re-installed within the cage without disturbing the operation of the other disk drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To effect this desirable hot plug connection of each of the disk drives, each disk drive is typically supported on a carrier structure which is slidably and removably insertable into the cage to mate an electrical connector carried on a rear portion of the drive or its carrier structure with a corresponding electrical connector on a back plane circuit board suitably supported at the rear interior side of the cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An increasing problem associated with the carrier support of disk drives removably mounted in cage structures or the like is the control of vibrational forces generated by the drives during their operation&mdash;particularly the self-induced oscillatory vibrational forces centered about the axis of rotation of the drive platter. When this type of vibrational force is substantial enough it causes an undesirable degradation in drive performance by increasing the drive seek time for either reading or writing data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in modern high speed hard disk drives, the track density (tracks per inch) at which the data is written has also correspondingly increased. At these high speeds and track densities, disk spindle imbalance forces and rotating actuator resultant forces cause internally generated vibrations that can degrade the data input/output performance of the drive. The actuator pivots about an axis and thus is sensitive to even low levels of vibration. If the actuator misses its seek during data transfer, one or more seek retries are required to complete its command. The extra time for he seek retries causes unwanted and preventable performance degradation of the drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This vibration-caused problem was not particularly significant in older, slower speed drives since the mass and physical geometries of the drives and most conventionally used drive carriers offered sufficient built-in damping of the self-induced operational drive vibration about the rotational axis of the drive platter. However, modern high performance hard disk drives now have spin rates in the 7,200 RPM to 12,000 RPM range&mdash;rotational rates which can cause substantial vibration-caused drive performance degradation if the vibrational forces are not appropriately controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One previously proposed approach to protecting a carrier-supported high speed disk drive of this type from vibration-caused performance degradation has been to simply provide heavier and longer drive carriers which have a natural tendency to reduce this vibrational energy due to their substantially increased mass that absorbs more of such energy. However, this increase in carrier size and mass undesirably increases the overall spatial envelope of each drive/carrier assembly with the result that the drives cannot be positioned in as dense an array as smaller drive/carrier assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another previously proposed approach to protecting a carrier-supported high speed disk drive of this type from vibration-caused performance degradation has been to position a resilient vibration absorbing structure between the disk drive and its supporting carrier structure. While this approach does not require that the size of the carrier structure be increased, it does undesirably increase the height (and thus the overall volume) of the drive/carrier spatial envelope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it can be seen that a need exists for improved apparatus for substantially reducing the vibration-caused performance degradation of a carrier-supported hard disk drive of the type generally described above. It is to this need that the present invention is directed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In carrying out principles of the present invention, in accordance with a preferred embodiment thereof, a computer system is provided which includes a CPU unit having a microprocessor and a data storage section operative to store data retrievable by the microprocessor. The data storage section includes a housing structure in which a stacked series of data storage devices, illustratively hot-pluggable hard disk drives, are removably supported using specially designed carrier structures upon which the individual disk drives are mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The carrier structures are configured to cooperate with the housing structure in a manner substantially preventing performance degrading, self-induced oscillatory rotational vibrational vibration of the stacked disk drives, during operation thereof within the housing structure, about the rotational axes of the disk drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment thereof, each carrier structure includes a body removably insertable into the housing structure to a supported operating position therein, and a fastening structure for anchoring the carrier structure to its associated disk drive. A vibration control structure is associated with each carrier structure body and is operative to create between the housing structure and the inserted body generally opposing interference fits that substantially is inhibit rotational vibratory oscillation of the inserted body, and thus the disk drive anchored thereto, relative to the housing structure about the rotational axis of the disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each carrier body has front and rear end portions, is rearwardly and removably insertable into the housing structure, and has spaced apart opposite side portions extending in a front-to-rear direction between the front and rear end portions. The opposing interference fits between the body and the housing structure are created by opposing projections formed on these side portions and corresponding inward projections formed on opposing side wall portions of the housing structure. The opposing housing body side portion projections are offset in a front-to-rear direction relative to the rotational axis of the disk drive anchored to the carrier, and is preferably offset in a forward direction relative to such rotational axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> By creating these opposed interference fits between the carrier structure bodies and the housing structure, performance degrading self-induced oscillatory operational vibration of the disk drives about their rotational axes is substantially inhibited without the necessity of increasing the size and masses of the carrier structures or providing them with space-consuming resilient vibration isolation structures between the disk drives and their associated carrier structures.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Schematically illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a representative computer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the components of which are interconnected as shown and include a computer, illustratively in the form of a tower type CPU unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; a monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; a keyboard <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; and a pointing device, representatively in the form of a mouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In addition to various other components disposed therein, the CPU unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a data storage section, representatively a vertically stacked series of hard disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, operative to store data that may be retrieved by a microprocessor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the CPU unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment of the CPU unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the vertically stacked series of hard disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removably positioned within a support housing, representatively in the form of a sheet metal cage structure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> positioned within the outer housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the CPU unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, using specially designed carrier apparatus embodying principles of the present invention and subsequently described herein. Alternatively, the cage structure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be located externally of the CPU housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> within a separate rack housing (not shown). Moreover, while the disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been representatively illustrated as being vertically stacked, they could also be positioned in a horizontally stacked array in which the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> was rotated ninety degrees to one side instead of being vertically oriented. </paragraph>

To the left of each of the connectors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are three vertically stacked LED indicating lights <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As later described herein, these indicating lights are used to provide a visual indicia as to the operating state of each of the hard disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Each of the disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supported on a specially designed carrier structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is used, as later described herein, to removably support the disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a manner creating a hot plug connection for each drive to one of the backplane connectors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. To facilitate the removable support within the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of each of the carriers, portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the vertical left and right side walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are lanced inwardly to form for each carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> a pair of front and rear guide rail sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on each of the left and right cage side walls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 16</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>), with each of the guide rail sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> being defined by vertically facing pairs of the lanced-in cage wall portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. For purposes later described herein, directly above each front pair of lanced-in wall portions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is an arcuate lanced-in wall portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Use and Operation of the Carriers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The operation, use and various advantages of the disk drive carriers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will now be described in detail with initial reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. To ready one of the carriers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for operative supporting connection to one of the hard disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the rear ends of the left and right side wall heat sink structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are pivoted outwardly away from one another and the opposite left and right side edges <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, to thereby increase the distance between the inner side surfaces <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the body sections <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The two side wall portions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> pivot horizontally about the vertical shouldered screws <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> at the front of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>), with the engagement of the rear corner tabs <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the inner end surfaces of the tab slots <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> serving to limit the extent of this outward pivoting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then simply placed atop the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so that the disk drive threaded mounting holes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are aligned with the front and rear mounting screws <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> captives retained on the left and right side wall structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The side walls <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are then pivoted back toward one another to their positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> in which they are parallel to the left and right side edges of the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Finally, the mounting screws <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are simply screwed into the corresponding opposing disk drive side openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> This simple procedure securely mounts the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the bottom, opposite sides and opposite ends of the mounted disk drive are shielded by portions of the carrier structure against user hand contact with the mounted disk drive, while at the same time providing an appreciable degree of ESD shielding for the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The completed disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may then be operatively inserted into the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) as later described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is subsequently withdrawn from the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the removal of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from its carrier is effected simply by unscrewing the mounting screws <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> from the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, pivoting the carrier side wall structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> outwardly to their <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> release positions to facilitate removal of the disk drive, and then simply lifting the now freed disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> off of the top side of the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As can readily be seen, both the installation of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on its associated carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the subsequent removal of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from its carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, can be carried out without the removal of any portion of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the balance thereof. This is due to the unique &ldquo;no loose parts&rdquo; construction of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in which all of its components are captively carried by the balance of the carrier. Specifically, the front ends of the side wall structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are captively and movably retained on the bezel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the rear ends of the side wall structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are captives and movably retained on the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the bezel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is captively retained on the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the latch assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is captively and movably retained on the bezel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the right side wall structure <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and the mounting screws <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are captives and movably retained on the left and right carrier side wall portions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. In this manner the potential for losing, misplacing or potentially damaging portions of carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in conjunction with mounting the disk drive on an associated carrier, or removing the disk drive therefrom, is substantially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Each of the disk drive/carrier assemblies may be operatively installed within the interior of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) by simply sliding the carrier mounting flanges <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> rearwardly into the appropriate opposing pairs of cage guide rail sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 16</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>), and then using the carrier&apos;s ejector latch assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to releasably mate, in a hot-plugged manner, the disk drive&apos;s rear-mounted SCA connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 15</cross-reference>) with a facing one of the backplane connectors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 16</cross-reference>).

The forwardly biased ejector lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is prevented from forwardly pivoting away from its fully closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11</cross-reference>A by the retainer slide member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, a portion of which forwardly overlies the outer side notch area <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> at the outer end of the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and releasably blocks forward pivoting of the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> relative to the front end of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the inner or right end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated spring member <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, adjacent the notch <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> therein, is received within an immediately adjacent vertical channel portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>a of the right side wall <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to remove the inserted disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the interior of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and unplug the disk drive connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from its associated backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the user simply moves the retainer slide member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> leftwardly, as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11</cross-reference>A, thereby leftwardly bending the spring arm structure <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and shifting the retainer slide member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> out of overlying, blocking engagement with the left end of the ejector lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> This permits the previously deformed outer side arm <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to forwardly pivot the ejector lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> out to an intermediate position thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 12</cross-reference>A) as indicated by the arrows <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 12</cross-reference>A. The pivotal movement of the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> from its fully closed position to its intermediate position does not unplug the disk drive connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from its associated backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, but exposes the juncture of the elongated main lever body and its inturned outer end portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to present a convenient pull handle structure to the user which he may grasp and pull forwardly with one hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By manually pulling in a forward direction on the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in its intermediate position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the lever member is forwardly pivoted outwardly to an opened position thereof shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This movement of the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to such opened position drives the inner end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated spring member <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> rearwardly against the vertical cage channel section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>) to forwardly drive the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> relative to the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the arrow <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, to decouple the disk drive connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from its associated backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A further forward manual pull on the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> pivots the inner spring member end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> out of leveraged engagement with the vertical cage channel section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and pulls the disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> out of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This process is simply reversed to easily and quickly install one of the disk drive/carrier assemblies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the interior of the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Specifically, with the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in its fully opened position the carrier mounting flanges <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10,16</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) are slid rearwardly into opposing pairs of the cage guide rail structures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 16</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) until the inner end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated spring member <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is adjacent the vertical channel section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). Lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is then rearwardly pivoted through its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> opened position and its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> intermediate position to its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> locked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Via the leveraged interaction between the inner end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated spring member <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and the vertical cage channel section <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>this drives the disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> further rearwardly relative to the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to couple the disk drive connector <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and its associated backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is rearwardly pivoted from its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> position to its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> position. As the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is further pivoted from its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> position to its <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> closed position, the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> engages and rearwardly bends the outer spring side arm <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, and the curved outer side surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the lever member outer end portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> engages and leftwardly cams the retainer slide member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> (thus leftwardly bending the spring arm structure <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>) to permit the lever member end portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to enter the space between the two lowermost heat sink fins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on the left front corner of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Upon entry of the lever end portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> into this space, the resiliently deformed spring arm structure <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> causes the retainer slide member <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> to snap rightwardly back into the outer end notch <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to releasably retain the lever member <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in its closed position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 11</cross-reference>A, against the forward pivotal biasing force of the resiliently deformed outer side arm <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of the bifurcated spring member <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the foregoing, the overall ejector latch assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is of a simple, relatively inexpensive construction, and is easily useable with one hand, in a quite intuitive manner, to latch and unlatch the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to and from the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and couple and decouple the connector pair <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The ejector latch assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in its closed orientation is also quite compact, but opens outwardly to define an easily graspable pull handle structure. While the ejector latch assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> has been illustrated as being associated with a disk drive structure it could be alternatively utilized with a variety of other types of pluggable devices such as, by way of example, circuit boards and CD ROM drives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In addition to its no-loose-parts construction and its improved ejector latch assembly, the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with several other advantages over conventionally configured carrier structures used to operatively support disk drives in support housings such as sheet metal cages. One of these additional advantages is the provision of substantially improved dissipation of disk drive operating heat. As will be recalled, the pivotable opposite side wall portions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are configured as heat sink structures, having integral fin portions <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> thereon. When one of the disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is supported on its carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the operation of the fan <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> draws cooling air <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> inwardly through the front carrier fins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and along the supported disk drive, and inwardly through the cage ventilation holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the carrier side wall cooling fins <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to convectively dissipate disk drive operating heat from the disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> This convective heat dissipation is very substantially augmented by the provision of the heat conductive thermal interface pad members <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 15</cross-reference>) which are compressed between the carrier side wall members <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and the facing left and right sides <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The use of these pads <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> substantially increases the conductive heat transfer between the supported disk drive and the heat sink side wall portions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to thereby increase the overall disk drive operating heat transfer to the cooling flow of air <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> rearwardly through the interior of the support cage structure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the carrier structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is the manner in which it provides a visual indication of the operational state of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that it removably supports within the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is hot plug-connected to its associated backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> within the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the circuitry associated with the drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., the electronics on its underlying circuit board portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>) activates the three LED indicating lights <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> leftwardly adjacent the backplane connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 14</cross-reference>) in accordance with the operational state of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When any of the three indicating lights <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is activated, its light output is received by the optical connector <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> on the left rear corner of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and transmitted via the associated one of the three fiber optic cables <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the lens structure <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> at the front of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and then to the associated one of the three drive operating icons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> via one of the lens sections <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> disposed in a central front end portion of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The unique positioning of the light transmitting elements <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> within the interior of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as opposed to being routed externally along the outer side thereof or on the cage structure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, provides this transfer of the LED indicating light signals without increasing the outer spatial envelope of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or adding the complexity of placing the transfer elements on the cage structure. Additionally, due to the use of fiber optic cables as the light transmitting elements, neither the required bends in the elements to accommodate the central placement of the operating icons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> nor the length of the transmitting element runs from the LED lights <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the operating icons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> appreciably diminishes the light output intensity at the operating icons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Illustratively, the hard disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supported by the carriers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are high speed drives that operate in the 7,200 RPM to 12,000 RPM rotational speed range. This speed range refers to the rotational speed range of the platter portion of each drive around a rotational axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the drive (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) which is transverse to the base wall <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As is well known, this high rotational speed tends to cause self-induced rotational vibration of the drive about the axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> as indicated by the double-ended arrow <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. If not suitably controlled, this rotational vibration <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can substantially degrade the performance of the supported disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Conventional approaches to controlling this self-induced operational vibration have included placing resilient vibration absorbing structures between the disk drive and its associated carrier, or simply increasing the size and mass of the carrier to better absorb this operational vibration of the disk drive. Neither of these previously proposed approaches has proven to be entirely satisfactory, the separate resilient shock absorbing system being an additional source of undesirable size, complexity and cost, and the increased size and mass of the carrier undesirably increasing he overall size of the stacked disk drive array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the specially designed carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, however, the self-induced rotational vibratory forces of its supported hard disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are very substantially reduced by using the two boss structures <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>) to create on the cage-inserted carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> two oppositely disposed interference fits between the boss structures <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the lanced-in carrier side wall portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in response to insertion of the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> into the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as previously described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> These opposite interference fits between the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are offset in a front-to-rear direction relative to the rotational axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the supported hard disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, such opposed interference fit locations are forwardly offset from the rotational axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, but could alternatively be rearwardly offset therefrom. Because of this offset of the two opposed interference fit locations from the rotational axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> it can be seen that the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> serves to strongly impede vibration induced rotation of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in either direction about the drive&apos;s rotational axis <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The bosses <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be simply be integral metal portions of the cage side wall sections <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> or, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, be partially defined by suitable nonmetallic inserts <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supported in base portions of the bosses <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Another potential source of damage to the disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> arises from what is commonly referred to as non-operational shock damage. This type of shock damage to one of the carrier-supported disk drives <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can arise when the carrier is removed from the cage <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and placed on a horizontal work surface such as a table or work bench. For example, if the removed carrier accidentally slips out of a technician&apos;s hand and falls only a short distance onto the surface, or is placed on edge on the surface and then tips over onto the surface, the carrier-supported drive can be damaged from this type of non-operational shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In previously utilized, relatively low speed disk drives stacked in relatively low density arrangements, the non-operational shock problem was dealt with by placing resilient shock absorbing foot structures on the bottom sides of the drive carriers. Thus, if the carrier fell a short distance or tipped over onto a horizontal support surface, the feed absorbed the resulting non-operational shock and prevented resulting damage to the carrier-supported disk drive. However, with the growing trend toward stacking carrier supported disk drives in increasingly dense arrays, the additional stacking space required by even these small resilient shock-absorbing feet came to be unacceptable, with the result being that many computer manufacturers simply eliminated such feet and relied on labels placed on the disk drives and warning users of the drives to handle them very carefully to avoid non-operational shock damage thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the specially designed carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, however, the configurations of the disk drive/carrier assemblies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are related to one another in a unique manner permitting the previously described vibration isolation feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) to be placed on the bottom sides of the carriers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> without appreciably increasing the overall stack height of a stacked array of disk drive/carrier assemblies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within the cage structure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, each disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is configured in a manner such that the top side edges of the top edge flanges <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the left and right carrier side wall structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are downwardly offset from the top side of the disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supported in the carrier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to thereby create in the assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> front-to-rear extending depressed areas <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>) outwardly adjacent top right and left corner portions of the supported disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> These depressed areas <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> define what may be termed nesting areas that downwardly receive the resilient support feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the bottom side of the upwardly adjacent carrier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the support feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the bottom side of the upper disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference> downwardly nest in the opposite top corner depressed areas <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the lower disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with the bottom sides of the support feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the upper disk drive/carrier assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>being downwardly offset from the top side of the top side of the lower disk drive <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, in each vertically successive pair of disk drive/carrier assemblies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> the resilient shock absorbing feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the upper assembly are received and nest within the outer spatial envelope of the lower assembly so that the desirable presence of the shock absorbing feet <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>does not appreciably increase the stack height of the multi-disk drive array. While this unique nesting of the support feet has been representatively illustrated and described in conjunction with a vertically stacked array of carrier-supported disk drives, it will be readily appreciated that it could also be utilized to advantage in conjunction with a horizontally stacked array of carrier-supported disk drives as well. </paragraph>
