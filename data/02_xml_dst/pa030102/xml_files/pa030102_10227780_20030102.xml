<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Method and arrangement for obtaining and conveying information about occupancy of a passenger compartment of a vehicle including at least one sensor for obtaining data from the passenger compartment. Information about the occupancy is generated based on the data and transmitted, e.g., through a cellular phone system, to emergency response personnel to enable them to respond accordingly. The information about the occupancy may be generated by a processor applying pattern recognition techniques so that any occupants of the seat may be classified and such classification transmitted to the emergency response personnel. The data may also be used to determine the number of occupants in the vehicle and/or whether the occupants are moving after a crash. The sensors may be a variety of sensors such as an ultrasonic sensor, an electromagnetic wave sensor, an electric field sensor, a chemical sensor, a weight sensor, a motion sensor, a microphone, a heartbeat sensor, a vibration sensor, an acceleration sensor and a capacitance sensor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to methods and arrangements for determining that there is a life form, i.e., a human being, in a vehicle and the location of the life form, i.e., in which seat the life form is situated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and arrangement for obtaining information about occupancy of a vehicle and utilizing this information for some other purpose, e.g., to control various vehicular systems to benefit the occupants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Even more specifically, the present invention relates to methods and arrangements for obtaining information about occupancy of a vehicle, in particular after a crash involving the vehicle, and conveying this information to response personnel to optimize their response to the crash and/or enable proper assistance to be rendered to the occupants after the crash. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In 1984, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a requirement for frontal crash protection of automobile occupants. This regulation mandated &ldquo;passive occupant restraints&rdquo; for all passenger cars by 1992. A more recent regulation required both driver and passenger side airbags on all passenger cars and light trucks by 1998. In addition, the demand for airbags is constantly accelerating in both Europe and Japan and all vehicles produced in these areas and eventually worldwide will likely be equipped with airbags as standard equipment, if they do not include them already. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Whereas thousands of lives have been saved by airbags, significant improvements can be made. As discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 referenced above, and incorporated herein by reference, for a variety of reasons, vehicle occupants can be or get too close to the airbag before it deploys and can be seriously injured or killed upon deployment of the airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, a child in a rear facing child seat, which is placed on the right front passenger seat, is in danger of being seriously injured if the passenger airbag deploys. This has now become an industry-wide concern and the U.S. automobile industry is continually searching for an easy, economical solution, which will prevent the deployment of the passenger side airbag if a rear facing child seat is present. An improvement on the invention disclosed in the above-referenced patent, as will be disclosed in greater detail below, includes more sophisticated means to identify objects within the passenger compartment and will solve this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Initially, these systems will solve the out-of-position occupant and the rear-facing child seat problems related to current airbag systems and prevent unneeded deployments when a seat is unoccupied. Airbags are now under development to protect rear seat occupants in vehicle crashes. A system is therefore needed to detect the presence of occupants, position, i.e., determine if they are out-of-position, and type, e.g., to identify the presence of a rear facing child seat in the rear seat. Current and future automobiles may have eight or more airbags as protection is sought for rear seat occupants and from side impacts. In addition to eliminating the disturbance of unnecessary airbag deployments, the cost of replacing these airbags will be excessive if they all deploy in an accident. The improvements described below minimize this cost by not deploying an airbag for a seat, which is not occupied by a human being. An occupying item of a seat may be a living occupant such as a human being or dog, another living organism such as a plant, or an inanimate object such as a box or bag of groceries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A device to monitor the vehicle interior and identify its contents is needed to solve these and many other problems. For example, once a Vehicle Interior Identification and Monitoring System (VIMS) for identifying and monitoring the contents of a vehicle is in place, many other products become possible including the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Inflators and control systems now exist which will adjust the amount of gas flowing into and/or out of the airbag to account for the size and position of the occupant and for the severity of the accident. The vehicle identification and monitoring system of this invention will control such systems based on the presence and position of vehicle occupants or the presence, position and orientation of an occupied child seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Side impact airbag systems began appearing on 1995 vehicles. The danger of deployment induced injuries will exist for side impact airbags as they now do for frontal impact airbags. A child with his head against the airbag is such an example. The system of this invention will minimize such injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Vehicles can be provided with a standard cellular phone as well as the Global Positioning System (GPS), an automobile navigation or location system with an optional connection to a manned assistance facility, which is now available on at least one vehicle model. In the event of an accident, the phone may automatically call 911 for emergency assistance and report the exact position of the vehicle. If the vehicle also has a system as described below for monitoring each seat location, the number and perhaps the condition of the occupants could also be reported. In that way, the emergency service (EMS) would know what equipment and how many ambulances to send to the accident site. Moreover, a communication channel can be opened between the vehicle and a monitoring facility/emergency response facility or personnel to enable directions to be provided to the occupant(s) of the vehicle to assist in any necessary first aid prior to arrival of the emergency assistance personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Vehicle entertainment system engineers have stated that the quality of the sound in the vehicle could be improved if the number, size and location of occupants and other objects were known. This information can be provided by the vehicle interior identification and monitoring system of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the entertainment system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) could be improved if the number, attributes and location of vehicle occupants were known. This can be used to provide a climate control system tailored to each occupant, for example, or the system can be turned off for certain seat locations if there are no occupants present at those locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the position of a particular part of the occupant is of interest such as: (a) his hand or arm and whether it is in the path of a closing window so that the motion of the window needs to be stopped; (b) the position of the shoulder so that the seat belt anchorage point can be adjusted for the best protection of the occupant; or, (c) the position of the rear of the occupants head so that the headrest can be adjusted to minimize whiplash injuries in rear impacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above applications illustrate the wide range of opportunities, which become available if the identity and location of various objects and occupants, and some of their parts, within the vehicle were known. Once the system is operational, it would be logical for the system to also incorporate the airbag electronic sensor and diagnostics system (SDM) since it needs to interface with SDM anyway and since they could share computer capabilities which will result in a significant cost saving to the auto manufacturer. For the same reasons, it would be logical for VIMS to include the side impact sensor and diagnostic system. As the VIMS improves to where such things as the exact location of the occupants ears and eyes can be determined, even more significant improvements to the entertainment system become possible through the use of noise canceling sound, and the rear view mirror can be automatically adjusted for the driver&apos;s eye location. Another example involves the monitoring of the driver&apos;s behavior over time which can be used to warn a driver if he or she is falling asleep, or to stop the vehicle if the driver loses the capacity to control it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Using an advanced VIMS, as explained below, the position of the driver&apos;s eyes can be accurately determined and portions of the windshield can be selectively darkened to eliminate the glare from the sun or oncoming vehicle headlights. This system uses electro-chromic glass, a liquid crystal device, or other appropriate technology, and detectors to detect the direction of the offending light source. In addition to eliminating the glare, the sun visor can now also be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention adds more sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities such as fuzzy logic systems, neural network systems or other pattern recognition computer based algorithms to the occupant position measurement system disclosed in the above-referenced patents and patent applications and greatly extends the areas of application of this technology. An example of such a pattern recognition system using neural networks using sonar is discussed in two papers by Gorman, R. P. and Sejnowski, T. J. &ldquo;Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Neural Networks</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1. pp. 75-89, 1988, and &ldquo;Learned Classification of Sonar Targets Using a Massively Parallel Network&rdquo;, IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol. 36, No. 7, July 1988. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Pattern recognition&rdquo; as used herein will generally mean any system which processes a signal that is generated by an object, or is modified by interacting with an object, in order to determine which one of a set of classes that the object belongs to. Such a system might determine only that the object is or is not a member of one specified class, or it might attempt to assign the object to one of a larger set of specified classes, or find that it is not a member of any of the classes in the set. The signals processed are generally electrical signals coming from transducers which are sensitive to either acoustic or electromagnetic radiation and if electromagnetic, they can be either visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, radar or other part of the electromagnetic spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;To identify&rdquo; as used herein will generally mean to determine that the object belongs to a particular set or class. The class may be one containing all rear facing child seats, one containing all human occupants, all human occupants not sitting in a rear facing child seat, or all humans in a certain height or weight range depending on the purpose of the system. In the case where a particular person is to be recognized, the set or class will contain only a single element, the person to be recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Some examples follow: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In a passive infrared system a detector receives infrared radiation from an object in its field of view, in this case the vehicle occupant, and determines the temperature of the occupant based on the infrared radiation. The VIMS can then respond to the temperature of the occupant, which can either be a child in a rear facing child seat or a normally seated occupant, to control some other system. This technology could provide input data to a pattern recognition system but it has limitations related to temperature. The sensing of the child could pose a problem if the child is covered with blankets. It also might not be possible to differentiate between a rear facing child seat and a forward facing child seat. In all cases, the technology will fail to detect the occupant if the ambient temperature reaches body temperature as it does in hot climates. Nevertheless, for use in the control of the vehicle climate, for example, a passive infrared system that permits an accurate measurement of each occupant&apos;s temperature is useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a laser optical system an infrared laser beam is used to momentarily illuminate an object, occupant or child seat in the manner as described, and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, of U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462. In some cases, a charge-coupled device (a type of TV camera also referred to as a CCD array) or a CMOS device is used to receive the reflected light. The laser can either be used in a scanning mode, or, through the use of a lens, a cone of light can be created which covers a large portion of the object. Also triangulation can be used in conjunction with an offset scanning laser to determine the range of the illuminated spot from the light detector. In each case, a pattern recognition system, as defined above, is used to identify and classify, and can be used to locate, the illuminated object and its constituent parts. This system provides the most information about the object and at a rapid data rate. Its main drawback is cost which is considerably above that of ultrasonic or passive infrared systems. As the cost of lasers comes down in the future, this system will become more competitive. Depending on the implementation of the system, there may be some concern for the safety of the occupant if the laser light can enter the occupant&apos;s eyes. This is minimized if the laser operates in the infrared spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Radar systems have similar properties to the laser system discussed above. The wavelength of a particular radar system can limit the ability of the pattern recognition system to detect object features smaller than a certain size. Once again, however, there is some concern about the health effects of radar on children and other occupants. This concern is expressed in various reports available from the United States Food and Drug Administration Division of Devices. Naturally, electromagnetic waves from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum could also be used such as, for example, those used with what are sometimes referred to as capacitive sensors, e.g., as described in U.S. patents by Kithil et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,366,241, 5,602,734, 5,691,693, 5,802,479, 5,844,486 and 6,014,602 and by Jinno et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,031 which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The ultrasonic system is the least expensive and potentially provides less information than the optical or radar systems due to the delays resulting from the speed of sound and due to the wave length which is considerably longer than the optical (including infrared) systems. The wavelength limits the detail, which can be seen by the system. In spite of these limitations, as shown below, ultrasonics can provide sufficient timely information to permit the position and velocity of an occupant to be accurately known and, when used with an appropriate pattern recognition system, it is capable of positively determining the presence of a rear facing child seat. One pattern recognition system which has been used to identify a rear facing child seat uses neural networks and is similar to that described in the above-referenced papers by Gorman et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A focusing system, such as used on some camera systems, could be used to determine the initial position of an occupant but is too slow to monitor his position during a crash. This is a result of the mechanical motions required to operate the lens focusing system. By itself it cannot determine the presence of a rear facing child seat or of an occupant but when used with a charge-coupled device plus some infrared illumination for night vision, and an appropriate pattern recognition system, this becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> From the above discussion, it can be seen that the addition of sophisticated pattern recognition means to any of the standard illumination and/or reception technologies for use in a motor vehicle permits the development of a host of new products, systems or capabilities heretofore not available and as described in more detail below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> 32. To provide an occupant sensor which determines the presence and health state of any occupants in the vehicle by analyzing sounds emanating from the passenger compartment. Such sounds can be directed to a remote, manned site for consideration in dispatching response personnel. </paragraph>

To provide a vehicle monitoring system which provides a communications channel between the vehicle (possibly through microphones distributed throughout the vehicle) and a manned assistance facility to enable communications with the occupants after a crash or whenever the occupants are in need of assistance (e.g., if the occupants are lost, then data forming maps as a navigational aid would be transmitted to the vehicle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve some of these objects, an arrangement for obtaining and conveying information about occupancy of a passenger compartment of a vehicle comprises at least one sensor for obtaining data from the occupant(s) of the passenger compartment, a generating mechanism coupled to the sensor(s) for generating information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the data obtained by the sensor(s) and a communications device coupled to the generating mechanism for transmitting the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. The communications device establishes a communications channel between the vehicle and the remote facility staffed by response personnel. As such, response personnel can receive the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment and respond appropriately, if necessary. There may be several sensors and they may be, e.g., weight sensors, weight distribution sensors, chemical sensors, vibration sensors, microphones, accelerometers, heartbeat sensors, motion sensors, ultrasonic wave-receiving sensors, electromagnetic wave-receiving sensors, capacitance sensors, or combinations thereof. The information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment can include the number of occupants in the passenger compartment, as well as whether each occupant is moving non-reflexively and breathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> When the sensors are wave-receiving sensors, a wave transmitter may be provided for transmitting waves into the passenger compartment such that each wave-receiving sensor receives waves transmitted from the transmitter and modified by passing into and at least partially through the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> One or more memory units may be coupled to the generating mechanism for storing the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment and also be coupled to the communications device for enabling transmission of the stored information. Specifically, the communications mechanism can interrogate the memory unit(s) upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one particularly useful embodiment, one or more devices or components for determining the health state of at least one occupant are provided, e.g., a heartbeat sensor, a motion sensor such as a micropower impulse radar sensor for detecting motion of the at least one occupant and motion sensor for determining whether the occupant(s) is/are breathing, and coupled to the communications device. The communications device can interrogate the health state determining device upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain and transmit the health state of the occupant(s). The health state determining device can also comprise a chemical sensor for analyzing the amount of carbon dioxide in the passenger compartment or around the at least one occupant or for detecting the presence of blood in the passenger compartment. Movement of the occupant can be determined by monitoring the weight distribution of the occupant(s), or an analysis of waves from the space occupied by the occupant(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When present, each wave-receiving sensor generates a signal representative of the waves received thereby and the generating mechanism may comprise a processor for receiving and analyzing the signal from the wave-receiving sensor in order to generate the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. The processor can comprise a pattern recognition algorithm for classifying an occupant of the seat so that the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment includes the classification of the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When present, the wave-receiving sensor may be a micropower impulse radar sensor adapted to detect motion of an occupant whereby the motion of the occupant or absence of motion of the occupant is indicative of whether the occupant is breathing. As such, the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment generated by the generating mechanism is an indication of whether the occupant is breathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Also, the wave-receiving sensor may generate a signal representative of the waves received thereby and the generating mechanism receives this signal over time and determines whether any occupants in the passenger compartment are moving. As such, the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment generated by the generating mechanism includes the number of moving and non-moving occupants in the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A method for obtaining and conveying information about occupancy of a passenger compartment of a vehicle comprises the steps of obtaining data from the passenger compartment, generating information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the obtained data, and transmitting the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment whereby response personnel can receive the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. Transmission of the information may entail establishing a communications channel between the vehicle and a remote facility staffed by the response personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Data may be obtained by physical measurements of the occupying items of the passenger compartment such as weight or by the reception of waves which vary depending on the occupancy of the passenger compartment. In this case, waves may be transmitted into the passenger compartment whereby the transmitted waves are modified by passing into and at least partially through the passenger compartment and then received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment may be stored in at least one memory unit which is subsequently interrogated upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. A signal representative of the received waves can be generated by sensors and analyzed in order to generate the information about the state of health of at least one occupant of the passenger compartment and/or to generate the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment (i.e., determine non-reflexive movement and/or breathing indicating life). Pattern recognition techniques, e.g., a trained neural network, can be applied to analyze the signal and thereby recognize and identify any occupants of the passenger compartment. In this case, the identification of the occupants of the passenger compartment can be included into the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of inventions disclosed herein are directed to methods and arrangements for controlling deployment of an airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One exemplifying embodiment of an arrangement for controlling deployment of an airbag from an airbag module to protect an occupant in a seat of a vehicle in a crash comprises determining means for determining the position of the occupant or a part thereof, and a control unit coupled to the determining means for controlling deployment of the airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof. The determining means may comprise a receiver, e.g., a wave-receiving transducer such as an electromagnetic wave receiver (such as a CCD, CMOS, capacitor plate or antenna) or an ultrasonic transducer, for receiving waves from a space above a seat portion of the seat and a processor coupled to the receiver for generating a signal representative of the position of the occupant or part thereof based on the waves received by the receiver. The determining means can include a transmitter for transmitting waves into the space above the seat portion of the seat which are receivable by the receiver. The receiver may be mounted in various positions in the vehicle, including in a door of the vehicle, in which case, the distance between the occupant and the door would be determined, i.e., to determine whether the occupant is leaning against the door, and possibly adjacent the airbag module if it is situated in the door, or elsewhere in the vehicle. The control unit may be designed to suppress deployment of the airbag, control the time at which deployment of the airbag starts, control the rate of gas flow into the airbag, control the rate of gas flow out of the airbag and/or control the rate of deployment of the airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Another arrangement for controlling deployment of an airbag comprises determining means for determining whether an occupant is present in the seat, and a control unit coupled to the determining means for controlling deployment of the airbag based on whether an occupant is present in the seat, e.g., to suppress deployment if the seat is unoccupied. The determining means may comprise a receiver, e.g., a wave-receiving transducer such as an ultrasonic transducer, CCD, CMOS, capacitor plate, capacitance sensor or antenna, for receiving waves from a space above a seat portion of the seat and a processor coupled to the receiver for generating a signal representative of the presence or absence of an occupant in the seat based on the waves received by the receiver. The determining means may optionally include a transmitter for transmitting waves into the space above the seat portion of the seat which are receivable by the receiver. Further, the determining means may be designed to determine the position of the occupant or a part thereof when an occupant is in the seat in which case, the control unit are arranged to control deployment of side airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> One method for controlling deployment of an airbag from an airbag module comprising the steps of determining the position of the occupant or a part thereof, and controlling deployment of the airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof. The position of the occupant or part thereof is determined as in the arrangement described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Another method for controlling deployment of an airbag comprises the steps of determining whether an occupant is present in the seat, and controlling deployment of the airbag based on the presence or absence of an occupant in the seat. The presence of the occupant, and optionally position of the occupant or a part thereof, is determined as in the arrangement described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the present invention also relates to methods for controlling a system in the vehicle based on an occupying item in which at least a portion of the passenger compartment in which the occupying item is situated is irradiated, radiation from the occupying item are received, e.g., by a plurality of sensors or transducers each arranged at a discrete location, the received radiation is processed by a processor in order to create one or more electronic signals characteristic of the occupying item based on the received radiation, each signal containing a pattern representative and/or characteristic of the occupying item and each signal is then categorized by utilizing pattern recognition techniques for recognizing and thus identifying the class of the occupying item. In the pattern recognition process, each signal is processed into a categorization thereof based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation stored within the pattern recognition means and associated with possible classes of occupying items of the vehicle. Once the signal(s) is/are categorized, the operation of the system in the vehicle may be affected based on the categorization of the signal(s), and thus based on the occupying item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> If the system in the vehicle is a vehicle communication system, then an output representative of the number of occupants in the vehicle may be produced based on the categorization of the signal(s) and the vehicle communication system thus controlled based on such output. Similarly, if the system in the vehicle is a vehicle entertainment system or heating and air conditioning system, then an output representative of specific seat occupancy may be produced based on the categorization of the signal(s) and the vehicle entertainment or heating and air conditioning system thus controlled based on such output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment designed to ensure safe operation of the vehicle, the attentiveness of the occupying item is determined from the signal(s) if the occupying item is an occupant, and in addition to affecting the system in the vehicle based on the categorization of the signal, the system in the vehicle is affected based on the determined attentiveness of the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention comprises means for irradiating at least a portion of the passenger compartment in which an occupying item is situated, receiver means for receiving radiation from the occupying item, e.g., a plurality of receivers, each arranged at a discrete location, processor means coupled to the receivers for processing the received radiation from each receiver in order to create a respective electronic signal characteristic of the occupying item based on the received radiation, each signal containing a pattern representative of the occupying item, categorization means coupled to the processor means for categorizing the signals, and output means coupled to the categorization means for affecting another system within the vehicle based on the categorization of the signals characteristic of the occupying item. The categorization means may use a pattern recognition technique for recognizing and thus identifying the class of the occupying item by processing the signals into a categorization thereof based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible classes of occupying items of the vehicle. Each signal may comprise a plurality of data, all of which is compared to the data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible classes of contents of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In one specific embodiment, the system includes location determining means coupled to the processor means for determining the location of the occupying item, e.g., based on the received radiation such that the output means which are coupled to the location determining means, in addition to affecting the other system based on the categorization of the signals characteristic of the occupying item, affect the system based on the determined location of the occupying item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment to determine the presence or absence of an occupant, the categorization means comprise pattern recognition means for recognizing the presence or absence of an occupying item in the passenger compartment by processing each signal into a categorization thereof signal based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible occupying items of the vehicle and the absence of such occupying items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> All of the above-described methods and apparatus may be used in conjunction with one another and in combination with the methods and apparatus for optimizing the driving conditions for the occupants of the vehicle described herein.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein the same reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side view, with parts cutaway and removed of a vehicle showing the passenger compartment containing a rear facing child seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a front passenger seat <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a preferred mounting location for a first embodiment of a vehicle interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention. The interior monitoring system is capable of detecting the presence of an occupant and the rear facing child seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, three transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are used, although any number of wave-transmitting transducers or radiation-receiving receivers may be used. Such transducers or receivers may be of the type which emit or receive a continuous signal, a time varying signal or a spacial varying signal such as in a scanning system. One particular type of radiation-receiving receiver for use in the invention is a receiver capable of receiving electromagnetic waves. In an embodiment wherein ultrasonic energy is used, transducer <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> transmits ultrasonic energy toward the front passenger seat, which is modified, in this case by the occupying item of the passenger seat, i.e., the rear facing child seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the modified waves are received by the transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. Modification of the ultrasonic energy may constitute reflection of the ultrasonic energy as the ultrasonic energy is reflected back by the occupying item of the seat. The waves received by transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> vary with time depending, on the shape of the object occupying the passenger seat, in this case the rear facing child seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Each object will reflect back waves having a different pattern. Also, the pattern of waves received by transducer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> will differ slightly from the pattern received by transducer <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> in view of its different mounting location. In some systems, this difference permits the determination of location of the reflecting surface (i.e., the rear facing child seat <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) through triangulation. Through the use of two transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, a sort of stereographic image is received by the two transducers and recorded for analysis by processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which is coupled to the transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. This image will differ for each object that is placed on the vehicle seat and it will also change for each position of a particular object and for each position of the vehicle seat. Elements <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, although described as transducers, are representative of any type of component used in a wave-based analysis technique, including, e.g., a transmitter and a capacitor plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;image&rdquo; recorded from each ultrasonic transducer/receiver, for ultrasonic systems, is actually a time series of digitized data of the amplitude of the received signal versus time. Since there are two receivers, two time series are obtained which are processed by the processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may include electronic circuitry and associated, embedded software. Processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> constitutes one form of generating means in accordance with the invention which generates information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the waves received by the transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When different objects are placed on the front passenger seat, the two images from transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are different but there are also similarities between all images of rear facing child seats, for example, regardless of where on the vehicle seat it is placed and regardless of what company manufactured the child seat. Alternately, there will be similarities between all images of people sitting on the seat regardless of what they are wearing, their age or size. The problem is to find the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; which differentiate the images of one type of object from the images of other types of objects, e.g., which differentiate the occupant images from the rear facing child seat images. The similarities of these images for various child seats are frequently not obvious to a person looking at plots of the time series and thus computer algorithms are developed to sort out the various patterns. For a more detailed discussion of pattern recognition see U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,295 to Varga et. al., which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The determination of these rules is central to the pattern recognition techniques used in this invention. In general, three approaches have been useful, artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (although additional types of pattern recognition techniques may also be used, such as sensor fusion). In some implementations of this invention, such as the determination that there is an object in the path of a closing window as described below, the rules are sufficiently obvious that a trained researcher can look at the returned acoustic signals and devise a simple algorithm to make the required determinations. In others, such as the determination of the presence of a rear facing child seat or of an occupant, artificial neural networks are used to determine the rules. One such set of neural network software for determining the pattern recognition rules is available from the NeuralWare Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The system used in a preferred implementation of this invention for the determination of the presence of a rear facing child seat, of an occupant or of an empty seat is the artificial neural network which is also commonly referred to as a trained neural network. In this case, the network operates on the two returned signals as sensed by transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. Through a training session, the system is taught to differentiate between the three cases. This is done by conducting a large number of experiments where all possible child seats are placed in all possible orientations on the front passenger seat. Similarly, a sufficiently large number of experiments are run with human occupants and with boxes, bags of groceries and other objects (both inanimate and animate). For each experiment with different objects and the same object in different positions, the returned signals from the transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are associated with the identification of the occupant in the seat or the empty seat and information about the occupant such as its orientation if it is a child seat and/or position. Data sets are formed from the returned signals and the identification and information about the occupant or the absence of an occupant. The data sets are input into a neural network-generating program which creates a trained neural network which can, upon receiving input of two returned signals from the transducers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, provide an output of the identification and information about the occupant most likely situated in the seat or ascertained the existence of an empty seat. Sometimes as many as 1,000,000 such experiments are run before the neural network is sufficiently trained so that it can differentiate among the three cases and output the correct decision with a very high probability. Of course, it must be realized that a neural network can also be trained to differentiate among additional cases, e.g., a forward facing child seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Once the network is determined, it is possible to examine the result using tools supplied by NeuralWare, for example, to determine the rules that were finally arrived at by the trial and error techniques. In that case, the rules can then be programmed into a microprocessor resulting in a fuzzy logic or other rule based system. Alternately, a neural computer can be used to implement the net directly. In either case, the implementation can be carried out by those skilled in the art of pattern recognition. If a microprocessor is used, a memory device is also required to store the data from the analog to digital converters that digitize the data from the receiving transducers. On the other hand, if a neural network computer is used, the analog signal can be fed directly from the transducers to the neural network input nodes and an intermediate memory is not required. Memory of some type is needed to store the computer programs in the case of the microprocessor system and if the neural computer is used for more than one task, a memory is needed to store the network specific values associated with each task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> An alternate system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a side view showing schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle cellular communication system. In this view, an adult occupant <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown sitting on the front passenger seat <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and two transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are used to determine the presence (or absence) of the occupant on that seat <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. One of the transducers <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in this case acts as both a transmitter and receiver while transducer <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> acts only as a receiver. Alternately, transducer <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> could serve as both a transmitter and receiver or the transmitting function could be alternated between the two devices. Also, in many cases more that two transmitters and receivers are used and in still other cases other types of sensors, such as weight, seatbelt, heartbeat, motion and seat position sensors, are also used in combination with the radiation sensors. As was also the case in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are attached to the vehicle buried in the A-pillar trim, where their presence is disguised, and are connected to processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that may also hidden in the trim as shown (this being a non-limiting position for the processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). The A-pillar is the roof support pillar that is closest to the front of the vehicle and which, in addition to supporting the roof, also supports the front windshield and the front door. Naturally, other mounting locations can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The interface between the monitoring system and the cellular phone system is shown schematically by box <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that outputs to an antenna <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>A. The transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the pattern recognition hardware and software, which is implemented in processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and is packaged on a printed circuit board or flex circuit along with the transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, determine the presence of an occupant within a few seconds after the vehicle is started. Similar systems located to monitor the remaining seats in the vehicle, also determine the presence of occupants at the other seating locations and this result is stored in the computer memory which is part of each monitoring system processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In the event of an accident, the electronic system associated with the cellular phone system interrogates the various interior monitoring system memories and arrives at a count of the number of occupants in the vehicle, and in more sophisticated systems, even makes a determination as to whether each occupant was wearing a seatbelt and if he or she is moving after the accident. The phone system then automatically dials the EMS operator (such as 911) and the information obtained from the interior monitoring systems is forwarded so that a determination can be made as to the number of ambulances and other equipment to send to the accident site. Vehicles having this capability are now in service but are not believed to use any of the innovative interior monitoring systems described herein. Such vehicles will also have a system, such as the global positioning system, which permits the vehicle to determine its exact location and to forward this information to the EMS operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Thus, in basic embodiments of the invention, wave or energy-receiving transducers are arranged in the vehicle at appropriate locations, trained if necessary depending on the particular embodiment, and function to determine whether a life form is present in the vehicle and if so, how many life forms are present. A determination can also be made using the transducers as to whether the life forms are humans, or more specifically, adults, child in child seas, etc. As noted elsewhere herein, this is possible using pattern recognition techniques. Moreover, the processor or processors associated with the transducers can be trained to determine the location of the life forms, either periodically or continuously or possibly only immediately before, during and after a crash. The location of the life forms can be as general or as specific as necessary depending on the system requirements, i.e., a determination can be made that a human is situated on the driver&apos;s seat in a normal position (general) or a determination can be made that a human is situated on the driver&apos;s seat and is leaning forward and/or to the side at a specific angle as well as the position of his or her extremities and head and chest (specific). The degree of detail is limited by several factors, including, e.g., the number and position of transducers and training of the pattern recognition algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In addition to the use of transducers to determine the presence and location of occupants in a vehicle, other sensors could also be used. For example, a heartbeat sensor which determines the number and presence of heartbeats can also be arranged in the vehicle. Conventional heartbeat sensors can be adapted to differentiate between a heartbeat of an adult, a heartbeat of a child and a heartbeat of an animal. As its name implies, a heartbeat sensor detects a heartbeat, and the magnitude thereof, of a human occupant of the seat, if such a human occupant is present. The output of the heartbeat sensor is input to the processor of the interior monitoring system. One heartbeat sensor for use in the invention may be of the types as disclosed in McEwan (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,573,012 and 5,766,208 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference). The heartbeat sensor can be positioned at any convenient position relative to the seats where occupancy is being monitored. A preferred location is within the vehicle seatback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Another type of sensor which is not believed to have been used in an interior monitoring system heretofore is a micropower impulse radar (MIR) sensor which determines motion of an occupant and thus can determine his or her heartbeat (as evidenced by motion of the chest). Such an MIR sensor could be arranged to detect motion in a particular area in which the occupant&apos;s chest would most likely be situated or could be coupled to an arrangement which determines the location of the occupant&apos;s chest and then adjusts the operational field of the MIR sensor based on the determined location of the occupant&apos;s chest. A motion sensor utilizing a micro-power impulse radar (MIR) system as disclosed, for example, in McEwan (U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,070, which is incorporated herein by reference), as well as many other patents by the same inventor. Motion sensing is accomplished by monitoring a particular range from the sensor as disclosed in that patent. MIR is one form of radar which has applicability to occupant sensing and can be mounted at various locations in the vehicle. It has an advantage over ultrasonic sensors in that data can be acquired at a higher speed and thus the motion of an occupant can be more easily tracked. The ability to obtain returns over the entire occupancy range is somewhat more difficult than with ultrasound resulting in a more expensive system overall. MIR has additional advantages in lack of sensitivity to temperature variation and has a comparable resolution to about 40 kHz ultrasound. Resolution comparable to higher frequency is feasible but has not been demonstrated. Additionally, multiple MIR sensors can be used when high speed tracking of the motion of an occupant during a crash is required since they can be individually pulsed without interfering with each through time division multiplexing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> An alternative way to determine motion of the occupant(s) would be to monitor the weight distribution of the occupant whereby changes in weight distribution after an accident would be highly suggestive of movement of the occupant. A system for determining the weight distribution of the occupants could be integrated or otherwise arranged in the seats <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the vehicle and several patents and publications describe such systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> More generally, any sensor which determines the presence and health state of an occupant could also be integrated into the vehicle interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention. For example, a sensitive motion sensor can determine whether an occupant is breathing and a chemical sensor can determine the amount of carbon dioxide, or the concentration of carbon dioxide, in the air in the vehicle which can be correlated to the health state of the occupant(s). The motion sensor and chemical sensor can be designed to have a fixed operational field situated where the occupant&apos;s mouth is most likely to be located. In the alternative, the motion sensor and chemical sensor can be adjustable and adapted to adjust their operational field in conjunction with a determination by an occupant position and location sensor which would determine the location of specific parts of the occupant&apos;s body, e.g., his or her chest or mouth. Furthermore, an occupant position and location sensor can be used to determine the location of the occupant&apos;s eyes and determine whether the occupant is conscious, i.e., whether his or her eyes are open or closed or moving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The use of chemical sensors could also conceivably be used to detect whether there is blood present in the vehicle, e.g., after an accident. Additionally, microphones can detect whether there is noise in the vehicle caused by groaning, yelling ,etc., and transmit any such noise through the cellular connection to a remote listening facility (such as operated by OnStar&trade;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the invention including a system for determining the presence and health state of any occupants of the vehicle and a telecommunications link. This embodiment includes means for determining the presence of any occupants <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may take the form of a heartbeat sensor or motion sensor as described above and means for determining the health state of any occupants <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The latter means may be integrated into the means for determining the presence of any occupants, i.e., one and the same component, or separate therefrom. Further, means for determining the location, and optionally velocity, of the occupants or one or more parts thereof <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided and may be any conventional occupant position sensor or preferably, one of the occupant position sensors as described herein (e.g., those utilizing waves or electromagnetic radiation) or as described in the current assignee&apos;s patents and patent applications referenced A processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coupled to the presence determining means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the health state determining means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the location determining means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and/or communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be coupled to microphones <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> distributed throughout the vehicle and include voice-processing circuitry to enable the occupant(s) to effect vocal control of the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or any coupled component or oral communications via the communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also coupled to another vehicular system, component or subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and can issue control commands to effect adjustment of the operating conditions of the system, component or subsystem. Such a system, component or subsystem can be the heating or air-conditioning system, the entertainment system, an occupant restraint device such as an airbag, a glare prevention system, etc. Also, a positioning system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provides an indication of the absolute position of the vehicle, preferably using satellite-based positioning technology (e.g., a GPS receiver). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In normal use (other than after a crash), the presence determining means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determine whether any human occupants are present, i.e., adults or children, and the location determining means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> determine the occupant&apos;s location. The processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives signals representative of the presence of occupants and their location and determines whether the vehicular system, component or subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be modified to optimize its operation for the specific arrangement of occupants. For example, if the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines that only the front seats in the vehicle are occupied, it could control the heating system to provide heat only through vents situated to provide heat for the front-seated occupants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Another possible vehicular system, component or subsystem is a navigational aid, i.e., a route display or map. In this case, the position of the vehicle as determined by the positioning system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is conveyed through processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a remote facility and a map is transmitted from this facility to the vehicle to be displayed on the route display. If directions are needed, a request for the same could be entered into an input unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> associated with the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and transmitted to the facility. Data for the display map and/or vocal instructions could be transmitted from this facility to the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Moreover, using this embodiment, it is possible to remotely monitor the health state of the occupants in the vehicle and most importantly, the driver. The health state determining means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be used to detect whether the driver&apos;s breathing is erratic or indicative of a state in which the driver is dozing off. The health state determining means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could also include a breath-analyzer to determine whether the driver&apos;s breath contains alcohol. In this case, the health state of the driver is relayed through the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the remote facility and appropriate action can be taken. For example, it would be possible to transmit a command to the vehicle to activate an alarm or illuminate a warning light or if the vehicle is equipped with an automatic guidance system and ignition shut-off, to cause the vehicle to come to a stop on the shoulder of the roadway or elsewhere out of the traffic stream. The alarm, warning light, automatic guidance system and ignition shut-off are thus particular vehicular components or subsystems represented by <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In use after a crash, the presence determining means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, health state determining means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and location determining means <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> obtain readings from the passenger compartment and direct such readings to the processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> analyzes the information and directs or controls the transmission of the information about the occupant(s) to a remote, manned facility. Such information would include the number and type of occupants, i.e., adults, children, infants, whether any of the occupants have stopped breathing or are breathing erratically, whether the occupants are conscious (as evidenced by, e.g., eye motion), whether blood is present (as detected by a chemical sensor) and whether the occupants are making noise. Moreover, the communications link through the communications unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be activated immediately after the crash to enable personnel at the remote facility to initiate communications with the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The control of the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system alone would probably not justify the implementation of an interior monitoring system at least until the time comes when electronic heating and cooling systems replace the conventional systems now used. Nevertheless, if the monitoring system is present, it can be used to control the HVAC for a small increment in cost. The advantage of such a system is that since most vehicles contain only a single occupant, there is no need to direct heat or air conditioning to unoccupied seats This permits the most rapid heating or cooling for the driver when the vehicle is first started and he is alone without heating or cooling unoccupied seats. Since the HVAC system does consume energy, an energy saving also results by only heating and cooling the driver when he is alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of a vehicle passenger compartment showing schematically an interface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle heating and air conditioning system. In addition to the transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which at least in this embodiment are preferably acoustic transducers, an infrared sensor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is also shown mounted in the A-pillar and is constructed and operated to monitor the temperature of the occupant. The output from each of the transducers is fed into processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is in turn connected to interface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the HVAC control is based on the occupant&apos;s temperature rather than that of the ambient air in the vehicle, as well as the determined presence of the occupant via transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> as described above. This also permits each vehicle occupant to be independently monitored and the HVAC system to be adjusted for each occupant either based on a set temperature for all occupants or, alternately, each occupant could be permitted to set his own preferred temperature through adjusting a control knob shown schematically as <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Since the monitoring system is already installed in the vehicle with its own associated electronics including processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the infrared sensor can be added with little additional cost and can share the processing unit. Not only can this system be used for directing hot and cold air, but developments in the field of directing sound using hyper-sound (also referred to as hypersonic sound herein) now makes it possible to accurately direct sound to the vicinity of the ears of an occupant so that only that occupant can hear the sound. The system of this invention can thus be used to find the proximate direction of the ears of the occupant for this purpose. Additional discussion of this aspect is set forth below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Hypersonic sound is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,129 (Norris), U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,870 (Norris) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,351 (Raida et al.) and International Publication No. WO 00/18031 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety to the extent the disclosure of these references is necessary. By practicing the techniques described in these patents and the publication, in some cases coupled with a mechanical or acoustical steering mechanism, sound can be directed to the location of the ears of a particular vehicle occupant in such a manner that the other occupants can barely hear the sound, if at all. This is particularly the case when the vehicle is operating at high speeds on the highway and a high level of &ldquo;white&rdquo; noise is present. In this manner, one occupant can be listening to the news while another is listening to an opera, for example. Naturally, white noise can also be added to the vehicle if necessary when the vehicle is stopped or traveling in heavy traffic. Thus, several occupants of a vehicle can listen to different programming without the other occupants hearing that programming. This can be accomplished using hypersonic sound without requiring earphones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In principle, hypersonic sound utilizes the emission of inaudible ultrasonic frequencies that mix in air and result in the generation of new audio frequencies. A hypersonic sound system is a highly efficient converter of electrical energy to acoustical energy. Sound is created in air at any desired point which provides flexibility and allows manipulation of the perceived location of the source of the sound. Speaker enclosures are thus rendered dispensable. The dispersion of the mixing area of the ultrasonic frequencies and thus the area in which the new audio frequencies are audible can be controlled to provide a very narrow or wide area as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The mixing area generated by each set of two ultrasonic frequency generators in accordance with the invention could thus include only a single ear of an occupant (another mixing area being formed by ultrasonic frequencies generated by a set of two other ultrasonic frequency generators at the location of the other ear of the occupant with presumably but not definitely the same new audio frequencies) or be large enough to encompass both ears of the occupant. If so desired, the mixing area could even be controlled to encompass the determined location of the ears of multiple occupants, e.g., occupants seated one behind the other or one next to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The use of the vehicle interior monitoring system to control the deployment of an airbag is discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462. In that case, the control is based on the use of a simple pattern recognition system to differentiate between the occupant and his extremities in order to provide an accurate determination of the position of the occupant relative to the airbag. If the occupant is sufficiently close to the airbag module that he is more likely to be injured by the deployment itself than by the accident, the deployment of the airbag is suppressed. This process is carried further by the interior monitoring system described herein in that the nature or identity of the object occupying the vehicle seat is used to contribute to the airbag deployment decision. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a side view illustrating schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle airbag system <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> transmits a burst of ultrasonic waves that travel to the occupant where they are reflected back to transducers or receptors/receivers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The time period required for the waves to travel from the generator and return is used to determine the distance from the occupant to the airbag as described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462, i.e., and thus may also be used to determine the position or location of the occupant. In the case of this invention, however, the portion of the return signal, which represents the occupants&apos; head or chest, has been determined based on pattern recognition techniques such as a neural network. The relative velocity of the occupant toward the airbag can then be determined, from successive position measurements, which permits a sufficiently accurate prediction of the time when the occupant would become proximate to the airbag. By comparing the occupant relative velocity to the integral of the crash deceleration pulse, a determination as to whether the occupant is being restrained by a seatbelt can also be made which then can affect the airbag deployment initiation decision. Alternately, the mere knowledge that the occupant has moved a distance which would not be possible if he were wearing a seatbelt gives information that he is not wearing one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A more detailed discussion of this process and of the advantages of the various technologies, such as acoustic or electromagnetic, can be found in SAE paper 940527, &ldquo;Vehicle Occupant Position Sensing&rdquo; by Breed et al, which is incorporated herein by reference. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the time delay required for acoustic waves to travel to the occupant and return does not prevent the use of acoustics for position measurement of occupants during the crash event. For position measurement and for many pattern recognition applications, ultrasonics is the preferred technology due to the lack of adverse health effects and the low cost of ultrasonic systems compared with either laser or radar. The main limiting feature of ultrasonics is the wavelength, which places a limitation on the size of features that can be discerned. Optical systems, for example, are required when the identification of particular individuals is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> It is well known among acoustics engineers that the quality of sound coming from an entertainment system can be substantially affected by the characteristics and contents of the space in which it operates and the surfaces surrounding that space. When an engineer is designing a system for an automobile he has a great deal of knowledge about that space and of the vehicle surfaces surrounding it. He has little knowledge of how many occupants are likely to be in the vehicle on a particular day, however, and therefore the system is a compromise. If the system knew the number and position of the vehicle occupants, and maybe even their size, then adjustments could be made in the system output and the sound quality improved. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, therefore, illustrates schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention, i.e., transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which operate as set forth above, and the vehicle entertainment system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The particular design of the entertainment system that uses the information provided by the monitoring system can be determined by those skilled in the appropriate art. Perhaps in combination with this system, the quality of the sound system can be measured by the audio system itself either by using the speakers as receiving units also or through the use of special microphones. The quality of the sound can then be adjusted according to the vehicle occupancy and the reflectivity of the vehicle occupants. If, for example, certain frequencies are being reflected more that others, the audio amplifier can be adjusted to amplify those frequencies to a lesser amount that others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Vehicle entertainment system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> may include means for generating and transmitting sound waves at the ears of the occupants, the position of which are detected by transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as well as means for detecting the presence and direction of unwanted noise. In this manner, appropriate sound waves can be generated and transmitted to the occupant to cancel the unwanted noise and thereby optimize the comfort of the occupant, i.e., the reception of the desired sound from the entertainment system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the entertainment system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> includes speakers, the output of which can be controlled to enable particular occupants to each listen to a specific musical selection. As such, each occupant can listen to different music, or multiple occupants can listen to the same music while other occupant(s) listen to different music. Control of the speakers to direct sound waves at a particular occupant, i.e., at the ears of the particular occupant located in any of the ways discussed herein, can be enabled by any known manner in the art, for example, speakers having an adjustable position and/or orientation or speakers producing directable sound waves. In this manner, once the ears of the occupants are located, the speakers are controlled to direct the sound waves at the ears of the occupant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a schematic of a vehicle with four sound generating units <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> forming part of the entertainment system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> of the vehicle which is coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Sound generating unit <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> is located to provide sound to the driver. Sound generating unit <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is located to provide sound for the front-seated passenger. Sound generating unit <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> is located to provide sound for the passenger in the rear seat behind the driver and sound generating unit <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> is located to provide sound for the passenger in the rear seat behind the front-seated passenger. Sound generating units <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> operate independently and are activated independently so that, for example, when the rear seat is empty, sound generating units <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> are not operated. This constitutes control of the entertainment system based on, e.g., the number and position of the occupants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Each sound generating units <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> utilizes hypersonic sound to enable specific, desired sounds to be directed to each occupant independent of sound directed to another occupant. The construction of sound generating units utilizing hypersonic sound is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,885,129, 5,889,870 and 6,016,351 mentioned above and incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, multiple sound generating units or speakers can be provided for each sitting position and these sound generating units or speakers independently activated so that only those sound generating units or speakers which provide sound waves at the determined position of the ears of the occupant will be activated. In this case, there could be four speakers associated with each seat and only two speakers would be activated for, e.g., a small person whose ears are determined to be below the upper edge of the seat, whereas the other two would be activated for a large person whose ears are determined to be above the upper edge of the seat. All four could be activated for a medium size person. This type of control, i.e., control over which of a plurality of speakers are activated, would likely be most advantageous when the output direction of the speakers is fixed in position and provide sound waves only for a predetermined region of the passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Another manner in which the entertainment system can be controlled is to provide different outputs for the speakers based on the occupancy of the seats. For example, using the identification methods disclosed herein, the identity of the occupants can be determined in association with each seating position and, by enabling such occupants to store music preferences, e.g., a radio station, the speakers associated with each seating position can be controlled to provide music from the respective radio station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The maximum acoustic frequency that is practical to use for acoustic imaging in the systems is about 40 to 160 kilohertz (kHz). The wavelength of a 50 kHz acoustic wave is about 0.6 cm which is too coarse to determine the fine features of a person&apos;s face, for example. It is well understood by those skilled in the art that features which are smaller than the wavelength of the irradiating radiation cannot be distinguished. Similarly, the wave length of common radar systems varies from about 0.9 cm (for 33,000 MHz K band) to 133 cm (for 225 MHz P band) which is also too coarse for person identification systems. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, therefore, the ultrasonic transducers of the previous designs are replaced by laser transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> which are connected to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In all other manners, the system operates the same. The design of the electronic circuits for this laser system is described in some detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 and in particular <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> thereof and the corresponding description. In this case, a pattern recognition system such as a neural network system is employed and uses the demodulated signals from the receptors <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The output of processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the monitoring system is shown connected schematically to a general interface <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> which can be the vehicle ignition enabling system; the entertainment system; the seat, mirror, suspension or other adjustment systems; or any other appropriate vehicle system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> There are two preferred methods of implementing the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention, a microprocessor system and an application specific integrated circuit system (ASIC). Both of these systems are represented schematically as either <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> herein. In some systems, both a microprocessor and an ASIC are used. In other systems, most if not all of the circuitry is combined onto a single chip (system on a chip). The particular implementation depends on the quantity to be made and economic considerations. A block diagram illustrating the microprocessor system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> which shows the implementation of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An alternate implementation of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> system using an ASIC is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. In both cases the target, which may be a rear facing child seat, is shown schematically as <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the three transducers as <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, there is a digitizer coupled to the receivers <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and the processor, and an indicator coupled to the processor. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, there is a memory unit associated with the ASIC and also an indicator coupled to the ASIC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> view of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated with a box <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> shown on the front passenger seat in place of the rear facing child seat. The vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention is trained to recognize that this box <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> is neither a rear facing child seat nor an occupant and therefore it is treated as an empty seat and the deployment of the airbag is suppressed. This training is accomplished using a neural network with the commercially available software disclosed above and provided, for example, by NeuralWare of Pittsburgh. The system assesses the probability that the box is a person, however, and if there is even the remotest chance that it is a person, the airbag deployment is not suppressed. The system is thus typically biased toward enabling airbag deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Side impact airbags are now beginning to be used on some vehicles. These initial airbags are quite small compared to the driver or passenger airbags used for frontal impact protection. Nevertheless, a small child could be injured if he is sleeping with his head against the airbag module when the airbag therein deploys and a vehicle interior monitoring system is needed to prevent such a deployment in that event. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> single ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is shown mounted in the vehicle door adjacent to the airbag system. This device is not used to identify the object that is adjacent the airbag but merely to measure the position of the object. It is also understood that it can be used to determine the presence of the object, i.e., the received waves are indicative of the presence or absence of an occupant as well as the position of the occupant or a part thereof. Instead of an ultrasonic transducer, another wave-receiving transducer may be used as described in any of the other embodiments herein, either solely for performing a wave-receiving function or for performing both a wave-receiving function and a wave-transmitting function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A rear-of-head detector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This detector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is used to determine the distance from the headrest to the rear most position of the occupant&apos;s head and to therefore control the position of the headrest so that it is properly positioned behind the occupant&apos;s head to offer optimum support in the event of a rear impact. Although the headrest of most vehicles is adjustable, it is rare for an occupant to position it properly if at all. Each year there are in excess of 400,000 whiplash injuries in vehicle impacts approximately 90,000 of which are from rear impacts (source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, (NHTSA)). A properly positioned headrest could substantially reduce the frequency of such injuries, which can be accomplished by the head detector of this invention. The head detector <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is shown connected schematically to the headrest control mechanism and circuitry <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. This mechanism is capable of moving the headrest up and down and, in some cases, rotating it fore and aft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> When the driver of a vehicle is using a cellular phone, the phone microphone frequently picks up other noise in the vehicle making it difficult for the other party to hear what is being said. This noise can be reduced if a directional microphone is used and directed toward the mouth of the driver. This is difficult to do since the position of drivers&apos; mouths varies significantly depending on such things as the size and seating position of the driver. By using the vehicle interior identification and monitoring system of this invention, and through appropriate pattern recognition techniques, the location of the driver&apos;s head can be determined with sufficient accuracy even with ultrasonics to permit a directional microphone having a 15 degree cone angle to be aimed at the mouth of the driver resulting in a clear reception of his voice. The use of directional speakers in a similar manner also improves the telephone system performance. In the extreme case of directionality, the techniques of hypersound can be used. Such a system can also be used to permit effortless conversations between occupants of the front and rear seats. Such a system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> which is a system similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> only using three ultrasonic transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> to determine the location of the driver&apos;s head and control the pointing direction of a microphone <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. Speaker <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> is shown connected schematically to the phone system <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight> completing the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are placed high in the A-pillar and the third transducer <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is placed. in the headliner and displaced horizontally from transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The two transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> provide information to permit the determination of the locus of the head in the vertical direction and the combination of one of transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in conjunction with transducer <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is used to determine the horizontal location of the head. The three transducers are placed high in the vehicle passenger compartment so that the first returned signal is from the head. Temporal filtering is used to eliminate signals which are reflections from beyond the head and the determination of the head center location is then found by the approximate centroid of the head returned signal. That is, once the location of the return signal centroid is found from each of the three received signals from transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, the distance to that point is known for each of the transducers based on the time it takes the signal to travel from the head to each transducer. In this manner, by using the three transducers plus an algorithm for finding the coordinates of the head center, using processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and through the use of known relationships between the location of the mouth and the head center, an estimate of the mouth location, and the ear locations, can be easily determined within a circle having a diameter of about five inches (13 cm). This is sufficiently accurate for a directional microphone to cover the mouth while excluding the majority of unwanted noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The headlights of oncoming vehicles frequently make it difficult for the driver of a vehicle to see the road and safely operate the vehicle. This is a significant cause of accidents and much discomfort. The problem is especially severe during bad weather where rain can cause multiple reflections. Visors are now used to partially solve this problem but they do so by completely blocking the view through a large portion of the window and therefore cannot be used to cover the entire windshield. Similar problems happen when the sun is setting or rising and the driver is operating the vehicle in the direction of the sun. The vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention can contribute to the solution of this problem by determining the position of the driver&apos;s eyes. If separate sensors are used to sense the direction of the light from the oncoming vehicle or the sun, and through the use of electro-chromic glass, a liquid crystal device, or other appropriate technology, a portion of the windshield can be darkened to impose a filter between the eyes of the driver and the light source. Electro-chromic glass is a material where the color of the glass can be changed through the application of an electric current. By dividing the windshield into a controlled grid or matrix of contiguous areas and through feeding the current into the windshield from orthogonal directions, selective portions of the windshield can be darkened as desired. Other systems for selectively imposing a filter between the eyes of an occupant and the light source are currently under development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates how such a system operates. A sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> located on vehicle <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> determines the direction of the light <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> from the headlights of oncoming vehicle <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is comprised of a lens and a charge-coupled device (CCD), of CMOS light sensing or similar device, with appropriate electronic circuitry which determines which elements of the CCD are being most brightly illuminated. An algorithm stored in processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> then calculates the direction of the light from the oncoming headlights based on the information from the CCD, or CMOS device. Transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> determine the probable location of the eyes of the operator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of vehicle <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> in a manner such as described above in conjunction with the determination of the location of the driver&apos;s mouth in the discussion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this case, however, the determination of the probable locus of the driver&apos;s eyes is made with an accuracy of a diameter for each eye of about 3 inches (7.5 cm). This calculation sometimes will be in error and provision is made for the driver to make an adjustment to correct for this error as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The windshield <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of vehicle <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is made from electro-chromic glass or comprises a liquid crystal device or similar system, and is selectively darkened at area <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> due to the application of a current along perpendicular directions <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> of windshield <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. The particular portion of the windshield to be darkened is determined by processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Once the direction of the light from the oncoming vehicle is known and the locations of the driver&apos;s eyes are known, it is a matter of simple trigonometry to determine which areas of the windshield matrix should be darkened to impose a filter between the headlights and the driver&apos;s eyes. This is accomplished by processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A separate control system, not shown, located on the instrument panel, or at some other convenient location, allows the driver to select the amount of darkening accomplished by the system from no darkening to maximum darkening. In this manner, the driver can select the amount of light that is filtered to suit his particular physiology. The sensor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can either be designed to respond to a single light source or to multiple light sources to be sensed and thus multiple portions of the vehicle windshield to be darkened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the calculations of the location of the driver&apos;s eyes using acoustic systems may be in error and therefore provision must be made to correct for this error. One such system permits the driver to adjust the center of the darkened portion of the windshield to correct for such errors through a knob on the instrument panel, steering wheel or other convenient location. Another solution permits the driver to make the adjustment by slightly moving his head. Once a calculation as to the location of the driver&apos;s eyes has been made, that calculation is not changed even though the driver moves his head slightly. It is assumed that the driver will only move his head to center the darkened portion of the windshield to optimally filter the light from the oncoming vehicle. The monitoring system will detect this initial head motion and make the correction automatically for future calculations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Electro-chromic glass is currently used in rear view mirrors to darken the entire mirror in response to the amount of light striking an associated sensor. This substantially reduces the ability of the driver to see objects coming from behind his vehicle. If one rear-approaching vehicle, for example, has failed to dim his lights, the mirror will be darkened to respond to the light from that vehicle making it difficult for the driver to see other vehicles that are also approaching from the rear. If the rear view mirror is selectively darkened on only those portions which cover the lights from the offending vehicle, the driver is able to see all of the light coming from the rear whether the source is bright or dim. This permits the driver to see all of the approaching vehicles not just the one with bright lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Such a system is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> where rear view mirror <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> is equipped with electrochromic glass, or comprises a liquid crystal device, having the capability of being selectively darkened, e.g., at area <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>. Associated with mirror <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> is a light sensor <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> that determines the direction of light <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> from the headlights of rear approaching vehicle <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. In the same manner as above, transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> determine the location of the eyes of the driver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The signals from both sensor systems, <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> plus <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>, are combined in processor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, where a determination is made as to what portions of the mirror should be darkened, e.g., area <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>. Appropriate currents are then sent to the mirror in a manner similar to the windshield system described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Seatbelts are most effective when the upper attachment point to the vehicle is positioned vertically close to the shoulder of the occupant being restrained. If the attachment point is too low the occupant experiences discomfort from the rubbing of the belt on his shoulder. If it is too high, the occupant may experience discomfort due to the rubbing of the belt against his neck and the occupant will move forward by a greater amount during a crash which may result in his head striking the steering wheel. Women in particular experience discomfort from an improperly adjusted seatbelt anchorage point. For these reasons, it is desirable to have the upper seatbelt attachment point located slightly above the occupant&apos;s shoulder. To accomplish this for various sized occupants, the location of the occupant&apos;s shoulder must be known which can be accomplished by the vehicle interior monitoring system described herein. Such a system is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> that is a side view of a seatbelt anchorage adjustment system. In this system, a transmitter and receiver (transducer) <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is positioned in a convenient location, such as the headliner, located above and to the outside of the occupant&apos;s shoulder. A narrow elliptical beam <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> of energy is transmitted from transducer <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it irradiates or illuminates the occupant&apos;s shoulder and headrest. An appropriate pattern recognition system as described above is then used to determine the location and position of the shoulder. This information is fed to the seatbelt anchorage height adjustment system <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, shown schematically, which moves the attachment point <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> to the optimum vertical location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Acoustic resonators are devices that resonate at a preset frequency when excited at that frequency. If such a device, which has been tuned to 40 kHz, is subjected to ultrasonic radiation at 40 kHz, for example, it will return a signal that is much stronger than the reflected radiation. If such a device is placed at a particular point in the passenger compartment of a vehicle, the returned signal can be easily identified as a high magnitude narrow signal at a particular point in time which is proportional to the distance from the resonator to the receiver. Since this device can be easily identified, it provides a particularly effective method of determining the distance to a particular point in the vehicle passenger compartment. If several such resonators are used they can be tuned to slightly different frequencies and therefore separated and identified by the circuitry. Using such resonators the positions of various objects in the vehicle can be determined. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> for example, three such resonators are placed on the vehicle seat and used to determine the location of the front and back of the seat and the top of the seat back. In this case, transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, mounted in the A-pillar <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>, are used in conjunction with resonators <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight> to determine the position of the seat. This information is then fed to the seat memory and adjustment system, not shown, eliminating the currently used sensors that are placed typically beneath the seat adjacent the seat adjustment motors. In the conventional system, the seat sensors must be wired into the seat adjustment system and are prone to being damaged. By using the vehicle interior monitoring system alone with inexpensive passive resonators, the conventional seat sensors can be eliminated resulting in a cost saving to the vehicle manufacturer. An efficient reflector, such as a parabolic shaped reflector, can be used in a similar manner as the resonator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Resonators or reflectors, of the type described above can be used for making a variety of position measurements in the vehicle. These resonators are made to resonate at a particular frequency. If the number of resonators increases beyond a reasonable number, dual frequency resonators can be used. A pair of frequencies is then used to identify a particular location. Alternately, resonators tuned to a particular frequency can be used in combination with special transmitters, which transmit at the tuned frequency, which are designed to work with a particular resonator or group of resonators. The cost of the transducers is sufficiently low to permit special transducers to be used for special purposes. The use of resonators which resonate at different frequencies requires that they be irradiated by radiation containing those frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Another application for a resonator of the type described is to determine the location of the seatbelt and therefore determine whether it is in use. If it is known that the occupants are wearing seatbelts, the airbag deployment threshold can be increased since the airbag is not needed in low velocity accidents if the occupants are already restrained by seatbelts. This will reduce the number of deployments for cases where the airbag provides little or no improvement in safety over the seatbelt. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, for example, shows the placement of a resonator <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> onto the front surface of the seatbelt where it can be sensed by the transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Such a system can also be used to positively identify the presence of a rear facing child seat in the vehicle. In this case the resonator <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> is placed onto the forward most portion of the child seat, or in some other convenient position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Other uses for such resonators include placing them on doors and windows in order to determine whether either is open or closed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, for example, such a resonator <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is placed onto the top of the window and is sensed by transducers <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. In this case, transducers <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> also monitor the space between the edge of the window glass and the top of the window opening. Many vehicles now have systems which permit the rapid opening of the window, called &ldquo;express open&rdquo;, by a momentary push of a button. For example, when a vehicle approaches a tollbooth, the driver needs only touch the window control button and the window opens rapidly. Some automobile manufacturers do not wish to use such systems for closing the window, called &ldquo;express close&rdquo;, because of the fear that the hand of the driver, or of a child leaning forward from the rear seat, or some other object, could get caught between the window and window frame. If the space between the edge of the window and the window frame were monitored with an interior monitoring system, this problem can be solved. The presence of the resonator or reflector <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> on the top of the window glass also gives a positive indication of where the top surface is and reflections from below that point can be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Various design variations of the window monitoring system are possible and the particular choice will depend on the requirements of the vehicle manufacturer and the characteristics of the vehicle. Two systems will be briefly described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the first example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> single transmitter/receiver (transducer) <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> is used in place of and located centrally midway between the transducers <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. A recording of the output of transducer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> is made of the open window without an object in the space between the window edge and the top of the window frame. When in operation, the transducer <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> receives the return signal from the space it is monitoring and compares that signal with the stored signal referenced above. This is done by processor <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. If the difference between the test signal and the stored signal indicates that there is a reflecting object in the monitored space, the window is prevented from closing in the express close mode. If the window is part way up, a reflection will be received from the edge of the window glass which, in most cases, is easily identifiable from the reflection of a hand for example. A simple algorithm based on the intensity of the reflection in most cases is sufficient to determine that an object rather than the window edge is in the monitored space. In other cases, the algorithm is used to identify the window edge and ignore that reflection and all other reflections which are lower (i.e. later in time) than the window edge. In all cases, the system will default in not permitting the express close if there is any doubt. The operator can still close the window by holding the switch in the window closing position and the window will then close slowly as it now does in vehicles without the express close feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the second system, two transducers <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> are used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A and the processor <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> comprises a neural network. In this example the system is trained for all cases where the window is down and at intermediate locations. In operation, the transducers monitor the window space and feed the received signals to processor <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. As long as the signals are similar to one of the signals for which the network was trained, the express close system is enabled. As before, the default is to suppress the express close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The use of a resonator, or reflector, to determine whether the vehicle door is properly shut is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. In this case, the resonator <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is placed in the B-pillar in such a manner that it is shielded by the door, or by a cover or other inhibiting mechanism (not shown) engaged by the door, and prevented from resonating when the door is closed. Resonator <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> provides waves <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. If transducers such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are used in this system, the closed-door condition would be determined by the absence of a return signal from the B-pillar <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> resonator. This system permits the substitution of an inexpensive resonator for a more expensive and less reliable electrical switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The use of an acoustic resonator has been described above. For those cases where an infrared laser system is used, an optical mirror would replace the mechanical resonator used with the acoustic system. In the acoustic system, the resonator can be any of a variety of tuned resonating systems including an acoustic cavity or a vibrating mechanical element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> A neural network, or other pattern recognition system, can be trained to recognize certain people as permitted operators of a vehicle. In this case, if a non-recognized person attempts to operate the vehicle, the system can disable the vehicle and/or sound an alarm as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. In this figure the sensing transducers are shown as before as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>A, the alarm system schematically as <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and the alarm as <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. Since it is unlikely that an unauthorized operator will resemble the authorized operator, the neural network system can be quite tolerant of differences in appearance of the operator. The system defaults to where a key must be used in the case that the system doesn&apos;t recognize the driver or the owner wishes to allow another person to operate the vehicle. The transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>A are sensitive to infrared radiation and the operator is irradiated with infrared waves from transducer <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A. This is necessary due to the small size of the features which need to be recognized for high accuracy of recognition. An alternate system uses an infrared laser, which can be <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, to irradiate or illuminate the operator and a CCD or CMOS device, which can be represented as <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, to receive the reflected image. In this case, the recognition of the operator is accomplished using a pattern recognition system such as described in Popesco, V. and Vincent, J. M. &ldquo;Location of Facial Features Using a Boltzmann Machine to Implement Geometric Constraints&rdquo;, Chapter 14 of Lisboa, P. J. G. and Taylor, M. J. Editors, <highlight><italic>Techniques and Applications of Neural Networks</italic></highlight>, Ellis Horwood Publishers, New York, 1993. In the present case a larger CCD element array containing 100,000 or more elements would in many cases be used instead of the 16 by 16 or 256 element CCD array used by Popesco and Vincent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Once a vehicle interior monitoring system employing a sophisticated pattern recognition system, such as a neural network or fuzzy logic system, is in place, it is possible to monitor the motions of the driver over time and determine if he is falling asleep or has otherwise become incapacitated. In such an event, the vehicle can be caused to respond in a number of different ways. One such system is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and consists of a monitoring system having transducers <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> plus microprocessor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, programmed to compare the motions of the driver over time and trained to recognize changes in behavior representative of becoming incapacitated. If the system determines that there is a reasonable probability that the driver has fallen asleep, for example, then it can turn on a warning light shown here as <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> or send a warning sound. If the driver fails to respond to the warning by pushing a button <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, for example, then the horn and lights can be operated in a manner to warn other vehicles and the vehicle brought to a stop. One novel approach, not shown, would be to use the horn as the button <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. For a momentary depression of the horn, for this case, the horn would not sound. Naturally other responses can also be programmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> An even more sophisticated system of monitoring the behavior of the driver is to track his eye motions using such techniques as are described in: Freidman et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,648,052 &ldquo;Eye Tracker Communication System&rdquo;; Heyner et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,189 &ldquo;Eye Position Sensor&rdquo;; Hutchinson U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,670 &ldquo;Eye Movement Detector&rdquo;; and, Hutchinson U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,069 &ldquo;Eye Movement Detector With Improved Calibration and Speed&rdquo;, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The detection of the impaired driver in particular can be best determined by these techniques. Also, in a similar manner as described in these patents, the motion of the driver&apos;s eyes can be used to control various systems in the vehicle permitting hands off control of the entertainment system, heating and air conditioning system or all of the other systems described above. Although some of these systems have been described in the afore-mentioned patents, none have made use of neural networks for interpreting the eye movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In most of the applications described above, single frequency energy was used to irradiate various occupying items of the passenger compartment. This was for illustrative purposes only and this invention is not limited to single frequency irradiation. In many applications, it is useful to use several discrete frequencies or a band of frequencies. In this manner, considerably greater information is received from the reflected irradiation permitting greater discrimination between different classes of objects. In general each object will have different reflectivities and transmissivities at each frequency. Also, the different resonators placed at different positions in the passenger compartment can now be tuned to different frequencies making it easier to isolate one resonator from another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Although several preferred embodiments are illustrated and described above, there are possible combinations using other geometries, sensors, materials and different dimensions for the components that perform the same functions. This invention is not limited to the above embodiments and should be determined by the following claims. </paragraph>
